# Cross-Chain Borrowing Increases Debt Without Updating Borrower Rewards

### Summary

When a user borrows assets cross-chain, the _handleValidBorrowRequest function increases their debt (principle) on the source chain without first calling distributeBorrowerLend. This violates the reward calculation order, leading to the user receiving LEND rewards based on a larger debt than they had at the time the index was last updated. As a result, the user can overclaim LEND rewards, causing losses to the reward pool and other borrowers.

### Root Cause

The distributeBorrowerLend function, which finalizes a user's accrued rewards based on their current debt and index delta, is not called before the debt is increased in _handleValidBorrowRequest. Since rewards are computed as debt * indexDelta, updating the debt before updating the rewards allows a user to receive rewards based on inflated debt that didn’t exist when the reward index was last updated.

```solidity
    function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
       ...
        if (found) {
            // Update existing borrow
...
        } else {
            // Add new borrow record
            lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
                payload.sender,
                payload.srcToken,
                LendStorage.Borrow(
                    srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
                )
            );
        }

        lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(payload.sender, lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(payload.srcToken));
    }


 function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external onlyAuthorized {
...
     // @audit  borrowWithInterest increase without distribute update
        uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
            add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
            Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
        );

        // Calculate LEND accrued: lTokenAmount * accruedPerBorrowedUnit
        uint256 borrowerDelta = mul_(borrowerAmount, deltaIndex);
}
```

Similarly `_handleDestRepayMessage` is also not calls distribute before removing depts which would lead to loss of rewards.


### Internal Pre-conditions

A user initiates a cross-chain borrow
The destination chain handles the borrow logic and sends a message to the source chain.
_handleValidBorrowRequest is called on the source chain.
The borrow amount is added to the user’s cross-chain debt without distributing pending LEND rewards using distributeBorrowerLend.


### External Pre-conditions

*

### Attack Path

1. A user borrows a large amount on Chain B (destination chain).
2. Chain B sends the borrow request to Chain A (source chain).
3. _handleValidBorrowRequest on Chain A increases the user’s principle without calling distributeBorrowerLend.
4. Later, when distributeBorrowerLend is called, it calculates rewards based on the new, higher debt, applying it over the entire index delta.
5. The user receives excess LEND rewards as if they held this higher debt for the entire index delta duration.
6. Other borrowers get underpaid or no LEND at all due to this overclaim.

### Impact

Users receive more rewards than intended.
The reward pool depletes unfairly, impacting legitimate users.
`_handleDestRepayMessage` would cause a rewards loss for the borrowers



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call distributeBorrowerLend before modifying the user's debt in _handleValidBorrowRequest
