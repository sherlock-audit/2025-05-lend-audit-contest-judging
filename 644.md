# Flawed Shortfall Assessment in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal Due to Incorrect Debt Value Calculation for Non-Deprecated Markets

### Summary

In `CoreRouter.sol`'s `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, when handling non-deprecated markets, {root cause: (a) the USD value of the specific debt being liquidated (local variable `borrowedAmount`) is incorrectly calculated by attempting to scale the borrower's *total* USD debt (from all markets) using indices specific only to the *current* market being liquidated, and (b) the primary condition for allowing liquidation (account shortfall) is then incorrectly checked by comparing this miscalculated local `borrowedAmount` against the borrower's *total* USD collateral, instead of directly comparing the borrower's total USD debt against their total USD collateral}. This will cause an {impact: blocking of legitimate liquidations or, theoretically, allowing invalid ones, ultimately preventing effective risk management} for {affected party: the LEND protocol and liquidators}. This occurs when {actor: a liquidator attempts to liquidate an undercollateralized position} as {vulnerability path: `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is called, and if the flawed `require(borrowedAmount > collateral)` check fails due to the miscalculation of the local `borrowedAmount` (e.g., it's calculated as too low), a necessary liquidation of an actually undercollateralized account is blocked}.


### Root Cause

- In `CoreRouter.sol`, within the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, specifically in the `else` block (for non-deprecated markets):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L344-L350
    1.  **Incorrect calculation of local `borrowedAmount` (intended to represent current market's debt value):**
        ```solidity
        // Inside the 'else' block for non-deprecated markets:
        uint256 borrowedAmount; // This is a local variable, distinct from the 'borrowed' parameter
        // 'borrowed' (function parameter) is total USD debt of the account across all markets.
        // 'borrowBalance.borrowIndex' is the user's last market index for this specific lTokenBorrowed.
        borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex; // Flaw A
        ```
        This line attempts to derive the USD value of the debt in the specific `lTokenBorrowed` market. However, it incorrectly uses `borrowed` (which is the account's *total* USD debt across all markets, passed as a function parameter) and scales it by a ratio of market indices specific only to `lTokenBorrowed`. This formula does not correctly yield the USD value of the debt solely attributable to the `lTokenBorrowed` market.

    2.  **Flawed Shortfall Check:**
        ```solidity
        require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall"); // Flaw B
        ```
        This check then compares the incorrectly calculated local `borrowedAmount` (from Flaw A) against `collateral` (which is the account's *total* effective USD collateral across all markets, passed as a function parameter). The correct primary check for determining if an account is liquidatable (i.e., in shortfall) should be based on the overall account health: `require(borrowed > collateral, "Account not in shortfall");` using the function's input parameters `borrowed` and `collateral` which represent these total account values.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `borrower` has an active same-chain borrow position in a non-deprecated LToken market (`lTokenBorrowed`).
2.  The `LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))` returns `false`.
3.  The `borrower`'s overall account is genuinely undercollateralized, meaning the `borrowed` parameter (total USD debt of the account) passed to `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is greater than the `collateral` parameter (total USD effective collateral of the account).
4.  `LendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed)` returns a `borrowBalance` where `borrowBalance.borrowIndex` is non-zero and represents the market index at the borrower's last interaction with this specific borrow. `LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex()` also returns a valid current market index.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  Market price movements have caused the `borrower`'s overall position to become undercollateralized.
2.  A `liquidator` calls `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow`, which leads to `liquidateBorrowInternal` and then `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` being called. The `borrowed` and `collateral` parameters passed into `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` accurately reflect the borrower's total USD-equivalent debt and total effective collateral value, respectively.


### Attack Path

*(This describes a failure path for a legitimate liquidation due to the bugs)*
1.  A `borrower`'s account is undercollateralized. A `liquidator` initiates a liquidation by calling `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow(...)` for a specific `lTokenBorrowed`.
2.  The execution flow reaches `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(lTokenBorrowed, borrower, repayAmount, total_collateral_usd, total_debt_usd)`. It is established that, for the overall account, `total_debt_usd > total_collateral_usd`.
3.  The function enters the `else` block because the `lTokenBorrowed` market is not deprecated.
4.  The local variable `borrowedAmount_local_miscalculated` is computed using the flawed formula: `(total_debt_usd * current_market_idx_for_lTokenBorrowed) / user_snapshot_idx_for_lTokenBorrowed)`. This value does not correctly represent the debt in `lTokenBorrowed` in USD terms for this comparison, nor does it accurately reflect the `total_debt_usd` in a way that makes the subsequent check valid.
5.  The incorrect shortfall check `require(borrowedAmount_local_miscalculated > total_collateral_usd, "Insufficient shortfall");` is performed.
6.  **Failure Scenario**: If `borrowedAmount_local_miscalculated` (due to its flawed calculation method) is less than or equal to `total_collateral_usd`, the `require` condition (`>`) will be false, causing the message "Insufficient shortfall" to be emitted and the transaction to revert.
7.  This blocks a legitimate liquidation attempt, even though the borrower's account, when considering its *total* debt (`total_debt_usd`) versus its *total* collateral (`total_collateral_usd`), is indeed in a shortfall position (`total_debt_usd > total_collateral_usd`).


### Impact

* Legitimate liquidations are **blocked because the condition used to determine account shortfall within `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` for non-deprecated markets is fundamentally flawed.** It relies on an incorrectly calculated local `borrowedAmount` that does not accurately represent either the specific market's debt in comparable USD terms or the total account debt in a way that's meaningful for this specific check against total collateral.
* The primary check for an account being liquidatable (overall total debt value exceeding overall total effective collateral value) is effectively subverted or replaced by this incorrect check.
* This systemic inability to effectively liquidate undercollateralized positions leads to an **increased risk of bad debt for the LEND protocol**, as risky positions cannot be properly managed.
* Liquidators are unable to perform their function correctly for such positions, diminishing the protocol's risk management capabilities and overall stability.
