# Double-Counting of Interest in Liquidation Logic Allows Premature or Excessive Liquidation

### Summary

In the liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function, the borrowed amount passed in has already been scaled using the updated borrowIndex via a prior call to getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral. However, the function incorrectly applies the same scaling again using the current borrowIndex, resulting in a borrow amount that is artificially inflated. This can lead to borrowers being incorrectly liquidated or liquidators gaining excessive rewards.

### Root Cause

[CoreRouter 344](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L344-L350)

            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

A stale borrowBalance.borrowIndex is used in a second rescaling step inside liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal, even though the borrowed amount has already been updated with the new borrowIndex. This causes interest to be double-counted.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest() is called at the top of the liquidateBorrow() function, updating the borrowIndex.

2. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() is called afterward, and internally scales the stored borrow balance using the updated borrowIndex.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user has an outstanding borrow on a given lToken.

2. The user’s borrow balance is not underwater unless the interest is artificially inflated.

3. A liquidator calls the public liquidateBorrow() function to trigger liquidation.

### Attack Path

1. liquidateBorrow() is called.

2. It invokes accrueInterest(), which updates borrowIndex.

3. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() computes the updated borrowed amount using the new borrowIndex.

4. liquidateBorrowInternal() passes this borrowed to liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal().

5. That function re-applies the borrowIndex scaling:
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

6. This results in a doubled interest effect, inflating borrowedAmount.

7. Borrowers who should not be liquidated may be liquidated.

8. Liquidators can profit unfairly.



### Impact

1. Incorrect liquidations: Borrowers with sufficient collateral may be liquidated due to an inflated perceived borrow amount.

2. Economic exploitation: Liquidators may claim more collateral than they are entitled to.

3. Trust and integrity: Undermines the accuracy and fairness of the lending system.

### PoC

Assume:

Stored borrowBalance.amount = 1000 DAI

Stored borrowBalance.borrowIndex = 1e18

Current borrowIndex = 1.2e18

In getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral():

borrowed = 1000 * 1.2e18 / 1e18 = 1200 DAI

This borrowed = 1200 is passed into liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal.

Inside liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal():

borrowedAmount = (1200 * 1.2e18) / 1e18 = 1440 DAI

Bug: The true borrow is only 1200 DAI, but it gets calculated as 1440 DAI — a 20% inflation in borrow amount.

Result: Liquidation may wrongly occur, or be more severe than justified.

### Mitigation

Replace this line.

            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

With

            borrowedAmount = borrowed;
