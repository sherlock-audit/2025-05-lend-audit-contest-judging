# Economically Unviable Liquidations for Small Borrows

### Summary

Small investment positions are technically liquidatable but often not worth liquidating because the gas cost exceeds the reward. This makes them economically unviable, leading to potential griefing attacks.

### Root Cause

The protocol does not enforce a minimum investment amount, allowing users to invest very small amounts and borrow with them. While these positions meet the technical conditions for liquidation, the seized investment (minus protocol share) may be too low to justify the gas cost for the liquidator. This economic disincentive results in small unhealthy positions being ignored.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower has a small outstanding borrow position that is liquidatable.

2. The investment seized from liquidation is split between the protocol and the liquidator.

3. Gas costs for initiating a liquidation transaction are greater than the expected liquidation reward.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Malicious users can invest small amounts, borrow and not repay knowing these positions are unlikely to be liquidated

### Impact

Many small borrows remain unliquidated.
