# Healthy positions liquidation due to double application of interest calculation in liquidation checks

### Summary

The double application of borrow index multiplication in `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` will cause an inflated borrowed amount calculation for liquidation checks as the calculation multiplies the already interest-accrued borrowed amount by additional interest factors, allowing liquidation of healthy positions that should not be liquidatable.

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:347-351`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347-L351), the `borrowed` parameter passed to `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` is already scaled with accumulated interest from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`, but the code incorrectly applies the borrow index calculation again:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L346-L350

The `borrowed` variable from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` already includes interest accrual through `borrowWithInterestSame()` and `borrowWithInterest()` functions, which calculate `(principle * currentBorrowIndex) / originalBorrowIndex`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an existing borrow position with accumulated interest
2. Time needs to pass to allow interest to accrue on the borrow position
3. Liquidator attempts to liquidate the position

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral and borrows tokens, creating a healthy position
2. Time passes, allowing interest to accrue on the borrowed amount
3. Liquidator calls `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrow()` on the user's position
4. The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` function calculates an inflated `borrowedAmount` by double-applying the interest calculation
5. The inflated borrowed amount makes the position appear to have insufficient collateral (`borrowedAmount > collateral`) when it actually has sufficient collateral
6. The liquidation proceeds, seizing the user's collateral incorrectly

### Impact

Users suffer loss of their collateral as healthy positions become liquidatable. This allows liquidators to seize collateral from borrowers who should not be liquidatable, causing direct financial loss to borrowers.

### PoC

Add the following test to `TestLiquidations.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_liquidation_healthy_position() public {
    address user1 = makeAddr("user1");
    address user2 = makeAddr("user2");

    uint256 supplyAmount = 1000e18;
    address token = supportedTokensA[0];
    address lToken = lendStorageA.underlyingTolToken(token);

    _supplyA(user1, supplyAmount, 0);

    _supplyA(user2, supplyAmount, 0);

    uint256 borrowAmount = (supplyAmount * 750 / 1000) - 1e16;
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    coreRouterA.borrow(borrowAmount, token);

    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attempt liquidation
    vm.startPrank(liquidator);
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(liquidator, borrowAmount);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouterA), borrowAmount);

    // Repay 0.5% of the borrow
    uint256 repayAmount = borrowAmount / 200;

    // Advance some blocks to accrue interest
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 300);
    vm.roll(block.number + 300);

    LToken(lToken).accrueInterest();

    (uint256 currentBorrowed, uint256 currentCollateral) =
        lendStorageA.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(user1, LToken(lToken), 0, 0);

    // Collateral > borrowed, healthy position
    assertGt(currentCollateral, currentBorrowed);

    // Liquidation success !!
    coreRouterA.liquidateBorrow(user1, repayAmount, lToken, token);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

Test passed, but should have reverted as the `liquidateBorrow()` call should revert with `Insufficient shortfall`.

### Mitigation

Remove the duplicate interest calculation in `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()`. The `borrowed` variable should be used directly since it already includes accrued interest.
