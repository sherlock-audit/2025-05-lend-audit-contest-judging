# Incorrect LEND Reward Attribution in Liquidation Flow

### Summary

In `CoreRouter's repayBorrowInternal` function, LEND rewards are incorrectly distributed to borrowers during liquidations, allowing them to receive rewards for repayments they didn't make.

### Root Cause

the repayBorrowInternal function distributes borrower rewards before processing the repayment:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L453C2-L504C6

```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(
    address borrower,
    address liquidator,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _lToken,
    bool _isSameChain
) internal {
    // ...existing code...

    // @audit - Rewards distributed before repayment
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

    // Actual repayment happens after reward distribution
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Borrower must have an outstanding loan:
Liquidation conditions must be met:
LEND rewards must be available:


### External Pre-conditions

Market price conditions that trigger liquidation
Liquidator with sufficient tokens to perform liquidation
LEND token contract must be active and have sufficient balance

### Attack Path

1. Monitor for liquidatable positions:


```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    borrower, 
    LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 
    0, 
    0
);
```

2. Liquidator initiates liquidation:


```solidity
coreRouter.liquidateBorrow(
    borrower,
    repayAmount,
    lTokenCollateral,
    borrowedAsset
);
```

3. Inside repayBorrowInternal:
```solidity
// Borrower gets rewards for liquidator's repayment
lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);
// Liquidator repays the loan
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
```

### Impact


```solidity
Example Scenario:
- Borrower has 100 ETH loan
- Accumulated rewards: 10 LEND tokens
- Liquidator repays 50 ETH
- Borrower receives rewards for 50 ETH repayment they didn't make

```

The major impact I can think of here is that :
There is an unfair advantage to defaulted borrowers as they get paid the reward for repayments they didn't make.
