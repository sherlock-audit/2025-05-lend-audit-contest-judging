# Cross-Chain Borrows can Lead to Router-Level Liquidation

### Summary

The lending protocol supports cross-chain functionality where users can deposit collateral on one chain and borrow on another. However, the liquidation logic on individual chains operates independently, without considering the global health of user positions across chains. This can lead to the entire router on a chain being liquidated—even when all individual users remain healthy—resulting in a protocol-wide failure.

### Root Cause

The current system allows users to deposit collateral on Chain A and borrow on Chain B, but only checks individual account health per-chain. This creates a dangerous scenario where the router contract, acting as an intermediary for cross-chain borrows, can become undercollateralized on the borrowing chain (Chain B) even if all individual users maintaining their positions through the router are globally healthy.

The root cause lies in the localized liquidation logic. While individual users might maintain healthy Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios by having sufficient collateral on Chain A to cover their borrows on Chain B, the router contract on Chain B accumulates the aggregated borrows and interest for all users borrowing through it. If the router's local collateral on Chain B (which might be minimal or zero, as users' actual collateral is on Chain A) becomes insufficient to cover its aggregated borrows and accrued interest on Chain B, the router itself can be liquidated by the Ltoken contract liquidation logic.

```solidity
    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
....
        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users deposit collateral across multiple chains (e.g., Chain A and Chain B).
Users borrow on Chain B using collateral from Chain A.
Router on Chain B accumulates total borrow across users.
Individual users stay within healthy LTV ratios globally.
Chain B router's local collateral becomes insufficient vs. its borrow due to interest accrual or new borrow actions.

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

- Multiple users have collateral on Chain A and borrow from Chain B.
- Interest accumulates on Chain B borrow positions, increasing the router's total debt.
- At some point, the router's total local collateral on Chain B becomes insufficient.
- LToken-level liquidation logic checks only local values and triggers liquidation of the router.
- Collateral is seized from the Chain B router.
- Users:
Cannot withdraw their collateral on Chain B.
Cannot repay their debt (collateral is already gone).

- Protocol is broken as healthy position users cannot withdraw or repay

### Impact

Catastrophic protocol failure on the affected chain.
Users who have collateral on Chain A and were borrowing through this router on Chain B are now unable to withdraw their collateral on Chain A.
They are also unable to repay their debt on Chain B because the mechanism linking their Chain A collateral to their Chain B debt (the router) has been liquidated and its local collateral seized.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Establish router-level borrowing limits
Implement liqudation logic to redistribute new depts and colleterals
