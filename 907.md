# Missing Oracle Price Timestamp Validation

### Summary

The absence of oracle price timestamp validation will cause potential price manipulation risks for all protocol users as attackers can exploit stale prices to manipulate borrowing and liquidation mechanisms.

### Root Cause

In LendStorage.sol, the contract uses `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset)` to fetch asset prices but fails to validate whether these prices are recent or stale. There is no timestamp checking mechanism in place to ensure that the oracle data is fresh and reliable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol needs to use `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` to calculate user's collateral value and borrowed value
2. The oracle price returned by `getUnderlyingPrice()` becomes stale (outdated)

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market conditions change significantly after the oracle price becomes stale
2. The difference between stale price and current market price exceeds a critical threshold

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the oracle for stale prices
2. When a significant price movement occurs but the oracle hasn't updated (price is stale)
3. Attacker executes transactions that exploit the price difference:
    * If actual price is lower than stale price: Attacker can over-borrow against their collateral
    * If actual price is higher than stale price: Attacker can avoid liquidation or liquidate others unfairly

### Impact

The protocol users suffer potential losses due to incorrect pricing. In extreme market volatility, this could lead to significant undercollateralized positions, improper liquidations, and protocol insolvency. The severity increases with the amount of time prices remain stale and the volatility of the underlying assets.
