# Non-reverting USDT Transfer Failures Leading to State Inconsistencies and Token Loss

### Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract, which manages lending operations on the Ethereum mainnet, interacts with underlying tokens, including `USDT`. Due to USDT's non-standard ERC20 implementation, the contract may encounter issues when using the `.transfer()` method.



### Root Cause

`USDT` returns a boolean value from the `transfer` function. In the event of a failure, this functions return `false` instead of reverting.

The `CoreRouter` contract uses `.transfer()` for token transfers, which may not handle USDT's behavior correctly.

**In redeem()**
```solidity
        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

**In borrow()**
```solidity
        // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```

**In `borrowForCrossChain()`**
```solidity
        IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
```

Misinterpretation of transfer failure can lead to succeeded operations and incorrect state updates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users uses USDT as underlying token (for borrow or redeem)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Functions such as `redeem`, `borrow`, and `borrowForCrossChain` may not execute as intended when dealing with USDT.

If a USDT transfer fails in the `redeem` function, the transaction will not revert, and the contract state will still be updated. As a result, users will not receive the underlying tokens, effectively losing them. Similarly, in the `borrow` function, the contract may record that USDT has been transferred to the user, but the tokens will not actually be sent. The same issue applies to the `borrowForCrossChain` function, where the contract may incorrectly assume a successful transfer.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace `.transfer()` calls with SafeERC20's safeTransfer to ensure compatibility with USDT and handle non-standard behavior.
