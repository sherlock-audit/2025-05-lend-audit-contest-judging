# Incorrect fee validation in CrossChainRouter allows users to bypass payment requirements using contract's accumulated ETH

### Summary

The use of contract balance instead of `msg.value` for fee validation will cause an economic vulnerability for the protocol as users will be able to execute cross-chain operations without paying their own fees by leveraging the contract's accumulated ETH balance.

### Root Cause

The [`_payNative`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L794) function incorrectly validates cross-chain messaging fees by checking the contract's total ETH balance (`address(this).balance`) instead of the transaction's ETH value (`msg.value`). This allows users to bypass fee payments if the contract has accumulated enough ETH from previous transactions. The function is meant to ensure each user pays their own fees for cross-chain operations, but the implementation allows users to use the contract's accumulated ETH balance instead.

```solidity
function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual override returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
    if (address(this).balance < _nativeFee) {  // VULNERABLE: Uses contract balance instead of msg.value
        revert NotEnoughNative(address(this).balance);
    }
    return _nativeFee;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract must have accumulated ETH balance from previous users' transactions
2. The accumulated balance must be greater than or equal to the required native fee for the cross-chain operation
3. The contract must have the `receive()` function to accept ETH (which it does)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes that the contract has accumulated ETH from previous users' transactions
2. Attacker calls `borrowCrossChain` or any other cross-chain function without sending ETH
3. The `_payNative` function checks `address(this).balance` instead of `msg.value`
4. Since the contract has enough balance, the transaction succeeds without the attacker paying their own fee

### Impact

The protocol suffers an economic loss as users can execute cross-chain operations without paying their fair share of fees. The contract's accumulated ETH balance can be drained by users who haven't contributed to it, leading to an unfair distribution of costs and potential depletion of the contract's ETH reserves. This could result in the protocol having to subsidize cross-chain operations or risk running out of ETH for legitimate fee payments.


### PoC

Alice and Bob want to execute cross-chain operations:

1. Alice executes a cross-chain operation:
   - Sends 1 ETH to the contract for her operation
   - Her transaction succeeds and the contract now has 1 ETH

2. Bob wants to execute a cross-chain operation:
   - Bob has no ETH but notices the contract has 1 ETH from Alice
   - Bob calls `borrowCrossChain` without sending any ETH
   - The `_payNative` function checks `address(this).balance` (1 ETH) instead of `msg.value` (0 ETH)
   - Bob's transaction succeeds without paying any fee
   - The contract's balance is now used for Bob's operation

3. Result:
   - Alice paid 1 ETH for her operation
   - Bob executed the same operation without paying anything
   - The contract's balance from Alice's payment was used for Bob's operation
   - This can be repeated by any user as long as the contract has enough balance

### Mitigation

Replace `address(this).balance` with `msg.value` in the `_payNative` function to ensure each user pays their own fees for cross-chain operations. This will enforce that each transaction must include the required fee amount.
