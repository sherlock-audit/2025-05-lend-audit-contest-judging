# Incorrect LToken Accounting in `CoreRouter.supply()` can lead to discrepancy in User's favor

### Summary

The `CoreRouter.supply()` function calculates the amount of LTokens to credit a user based on `LToken.exchangeRateStored()`, which can be stale. It then updates the user's balance in `LendStorage` with this calculated amount. However, the actual minting of LTokens by the `LToken` contract (to `CoreRouter`) occurs using the LToken's current, up-to-date exchange rate. If the stored exchange rate is stale and lower than the current one, `CoreRouter` credits the user with more LTokens in `LendStorage` than it actually received from the `LToken` contract. This discrepancy can be exploited by a user to be credited more LTokens than they are entitled to, potentially leading to a shortfall in `CoreRouter` when the user attempts to redeem these "phantom" LTokens.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability lies in `CoreRouter.supply()` using a potentially stale exchange rate to calculate the LTokens credited to the user, while the actual LTokens minted to `CoreRouter` are based on the current rate. `CoreRouter` does not use the actual outcome of the mint operation (i.e., how many LTokens it received) for its internal accounting of the user's balance.

1. [CoreRouter.sol:74](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74) fetches a potentially stale exchange rate:
```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
```
2. [CoreRouter.sol:77](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L77) instructs the `LToken` to mint LTokens. The `LToken.mint(_amount)` function internally uses the current exchange rate (after `accrueInterest()`) to determine how many LTokens to mint to `msg.sender` (which is `CoreRouter`). This function is expected to return 0 on success and doesn't directly return the minted LToken amount to `CoreRouter`'s `supply()` function scope.
```solidity
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
```
3. [CoreRouter.sol:80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80) then calculates the LTokens to credit the user (`mintTokens`) using the stale `exchangeRateBefore`:
```solidity
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```
4. Finally, [CoreRouter.sol:87](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L87-L89) updates the user's supplied balance in `LendStorage` using this potentially inflated `mintTokens` value, not based on what `CoreRouter` actually received or the LToken's current state post-mint.
```solidity
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
);
```

If `exchangeRateBefore` is stale and lower than the `LToken`'s actual current exchange rate at the moment of minting, `mintTokens` (credited to user) will be greater than the LTokens `CoreRouter` actually holds corresponding to this supply.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. The `LToken`'s `exchangeRateStored()` become stale.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies an LToken market where `LToken.exchangeRateStored()` is lower than the true current exchange rate. This can be achieved if significant interest has accrued in the LToken (e.g., due to active borrowing) since `exchangeRateStored()` was last updated or by front-running transactions that would update it.
2. The attacker calls `CoreRouter.supply(amount, underlyingToken)`.
3. `CoreRouter` fetches the stale `exchangeRateStored()` (`rate_stale`). It calculates `lTokensToCredit = amount * 1e18 / rate_stale`.
4. `CoreRouter` calls `LToken.mint(amount)`. Inside `LToken.mint()`, `accrueInterest()` is called, updating the exchange rate to the current, higher `rate_current`. The LToken contract then mints `actualLTokensMinted = amount * 1e18 / rate_current` to `CoreRouter`.
5. Since `rate_stale < rate_current`, it follows that `lTokensToCredit > actualLTokensMinted`. `CoreRouter` updates `LendStorage` to show the user supplied `lTokensToCredit`.
6. The user later attempts to redeem their `lTokensToCredit`. If `CoreRouter` tries to redeem these from the `LToken`, the `LToken` will only allow redemption based on the `actualLTokensMinted` it actually gave to `CoreRouter` for that supply (plus any other LTokens `CoreRouter` legitimately holds). If `lTokensToCredit` is significantly higher, `CoreRouter` might not have enough LTokens from that specific user's deposit to cover the redemption, or it might successfully redeem using LTokens from other users/sources, effectively externalizing the loss.

### Impact

* User gains undeserved LTokens.
* Potential insolvency of `CoreRouter` for the specific `LToken`.
* If `CoreRouter` manages to fulfill redemptions of these "phantom" LTokens using other funds or LTokens from other users, which represents a direct loss of other users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `CoreRouter.supply()` function should determine the amount of LTokens minted by inspecting the `LToken`'s balance of `CoreRouter` before and after the `LToken.mint()` call, or the `LToken.mint()` function should return the actual amount of LTokens minted. This actual amount should then be used to update the user's investment in `LendStorage`.
