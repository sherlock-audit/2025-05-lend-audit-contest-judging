# _lzReceive function in the CrossChainRouter contract lacks replay protection, allowing duplicate LayerZero messages

### Summary

The _lzReceive function in the CrossChainRouter contract lacks replay protection, allowing duplicate LayerZero messages to be processed multiple times.

### Root Cause

The _lzReceive Function in CrossChainRouter.sol: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L742-L785

The _lzReceive function in contract CrossChainRouter decodes the payload and processes it without checking for duplicates:
```solidity
     function _lzReceive(
        Origin calldata _origin,
        bytes32, /*_guid*/
        bytes calldata _payload,
        address, /*_executor*/
        bytes calldata /*_extraData*/
    ) internal override {
        LZPayload memory payload;

        // Decode individual fields from payload
        (
            payload.amount,
            payload.borrowIndex,
            payload.collateral,
            payload.sender,
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.srcToken,
            payload.contractType
        ) = abi.decode(_payload, (uint256, uint256, uint256, address, address, address, address, uint8));

        // rest of code
    }
```
Issue arises: The function receives a message via LayerZero, decodes its payload, and dispatches it to a handler based on the contractType. Thereâ€™s no check to determine if a message has been processed previously.
While LayerZero guarantees at least once delivery, messages are ensured to reach their destination. The CrossChainRouter contract needs to filter out duplicates. Without deduplication logic in _lzReceive, leading to duplicate BorrowCrossChain messages.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Due to a lack of replay protection allows duplicate LayerZero messages.
Attack Path: A BorrowCrossChain message processed twice would result in two borrows on the destination chain for the same collateral.

### Impact

Leading to over-borrowing against collateral.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use _guid to track processed message GUIDs in a mapping to reject duplicates
