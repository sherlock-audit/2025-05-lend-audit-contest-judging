# USDT Transfers  will revert

### Summary

The CoreRouter contract uses a direct IERC20 transfer call which expects a boolean return value. However, USDT on Ethereum mainnet doesn't return a boolean from its transfer function, causing all USDT redemption transactions via redeem() to revert.



### Root Cause

The root cause is the mismatch between the expected and actual implementation of the transfer function:

The contract expects: function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)
USDT actually  implements: function transfer(address to, uint256 amount)

```solidity
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- usdt on eth mainnet is supported and is the token of transfer 

### External Pre-conditions

- user attempts to redeem position with usdt as underlying asset. 

### Attack Path

1. User initiates a redemption of USDT tokens through CoreRouter
2. Contract attempts to transfer USDT using IERC20.transfer()
3. USDT's transfer function executes but returns no value
4. EVM reverts the transaction due to return value type mismatch
5. User's redemption fails and funds remain locked in the contract

### Impact

1. All USDT redemption operations will fail
2. Users cannot withdraw their USDT tokens
3. Core protocol functionality is broken for one of the most widely used stablecoins
4. Temporary fund lockup until fixed
5. Affects Ethereum mainnet where USDT is to be used

        //usdt mainnet token is not entirely erc20 compatibile with the

        // the trnasfer below reverts due to this

}


```

### Mitigation

Replace the direct transfer calls with OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20's safeTransfer function.
