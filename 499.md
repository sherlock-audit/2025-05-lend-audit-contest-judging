# Stale Interest Accrual Leads to Underestimated Max Liquidation Amount Causing Valid Liquidations to Fail

### Summary
In [`CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L190), the protocol’s liquidation validation logic fails to ensure interest is accrued before calculating the `maxLiquidationAmount` via `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()`. As a result, liquidations can be blocked or under-capped based on stale debt values, causing liquidation inefficiencies and allowing borrowers to maintain unhealthy positions beyond safe thresholds.

This vulnerability is especially critical in high-volatility events when liquidations must occur promptly to preserve protocol solvency.

### Root cause
in the external function `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain()`, the private function `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation()` is called which performs a check using the calculated value `maxLiquidationAmount` returned from `lendStorage::getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L190-L227
```javascript
//CrossChainRouter.sol 

 function _validateAndPrepareLiquidation(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private view {
    ...
 @>       uint256 maxLiquidationAmount = lendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(
            params.borrower,
            params.borrowedlToken,
            false // cross-chain liquidation
        );
@>        require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");
 }
```

The issue is that `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` calculates the maximum repayable amount as:
```javascript 
//lendStorage.sol
 function getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(address borrower, address lToken, bool isSameChain)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ...
uint256 maxRepay = (currentBorrow * closeFactorMantissa) / 1e18;
 return maxRepay;
    }
```
Where `currentBorrow` is fetched via `borrowWithInterest()` . These function rely on the borrower's `borrowIndex`, which may be stale since `accrueInterest()` isn't triggered on the lToken before the liquidation max repay calculation.

Because of this stale state, `currentBorrow` is underestimated, and so is `maxRepay`, causing liquidation attempts that would have been valid under up-to-date interest calculations to revert on this check:
```javascript
require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");
```

### Attack Path
Consider the following scenario:
1.  Protocol parameters:
closeFactorMantissa = 0.5e18 (50%)

2.  Borrower state:
- Initial loan: 1,000 ETH

- Accrued interest (not yet updated in protocol state): 220 ETH

- Actual current debt (initial + interest): 1,220 ETH

- Stale recorded debt (no interest accrued): 1,000 ETH

3. Liquidation attempt:

- Liquidator intends to repay up to the max allowed based on actual debt:
```javascript
maxRepay = 1,220 ETH * 0.5 = 610 ETH
```
- However, `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` uses the stale debt:
```javascript
maxRepay = 1,000 ETH * 0.5 = 500 ETH
```
- Liquidator submits a repay amount of `610 ETH`.

- The protocol performs the check:
```javascript
require(610 <= 500, "Exceeds max liquidation"); // Fails
```
4. Outcome:
The liquidation fails even though the liquidator’s repay amount is valid according to the borrower’s real outstanding debt. The stale borrow balance will cause the liquidation to revert unnecessarily.

### Impact
- Liquidators are prevented from performing valid liquidations, reducing protocol efficiency in cleaning up unhealthy loans.

- Borrowers with accruing interest that is not promptly updated can avoid partial liquidation.

### Recommendation
Ensure `accrueInterest()` is called or interest is accurately accrued before `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` is called.
