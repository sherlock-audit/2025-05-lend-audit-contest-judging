# Inadequate Shortfall Check in Cross-Chain Liquidation

### Summary

liquidateCrossChain uses outdated LendStorage data, allowing liquidation of overcollateralized accounts, leading to unfair collateral seizures.

### Root Cause

- Conceptual Mistake:
 Reliance on stored values without real-time price checks fails to confirm undercollateralization.

- Code Reference: 
In CrossChainRouter.sol:122–141, liquidateCrossChain calls LendStorage::getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount without validating current collateral values.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have a borrow on Chain B and collateral on Chain A (lines 554–589, LendStorage.sol).

2. Protocol needs to store outdated collateral values in LendStorage.

### External Pre-conditions

Collateral asset price increases, making the account overcollateralized.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a user with outdated collateral data.

2. Calls liquidateCrossChain, seizing collateral despite overcollateralization.

3. Protocol transfers collateral to attacker.

### Impact

User loses collateral while attacker gains it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use cross-chain oracles for real-time collateral checks:

```solidity
function liquidateCrossChain(address borrower, uint repayAmount, uint16 dstChainId) external {
    require(getRealTimeLiquidity(borrower) < 0, "Not undercollateralized");
    // Proceed with liquidation
}
```
