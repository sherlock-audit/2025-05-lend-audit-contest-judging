# Error safeTransfer in _handleLiquidationFailure, which causes attackers to steal the funds.

### Summary

```solidity
    function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```

The _handleLiquidationFailure function in the CrossChainRouter.sol contract is responsible for handling the scenario where a cross-chain liquidation is deemed invalid on chain A (the collateral chain). However, the current implementation of this function attempts to "refund" funds to the liquidator, which is incorrect as liquidator didn't pay anything.

### Root Cause

Error safeTransfer in _handleLiquidationFailure.
