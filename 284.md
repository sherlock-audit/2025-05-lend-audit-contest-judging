# The useless lines

### Summary

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

Here, There is 2 bugs.

Case 1
when currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0, The borrow function incorrectly computes the borrowAmount by applying interest again on a value that already includes accrued interest. This leads to a stricter borrowing limit than intended, restricting users from borrowing the full amount they are eligible for.

Case 2
when currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0, First-time borrowers (i.e., users with currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0) can bypass collateral checks in the borrow function. Because the borrowAmount calculation is skipped when currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0, users are able to borrow any amount without supplying collateral. This leads to a critical scenario where an attacker can drain the lending pool with no prior deposit.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in this line: [CoreRouter.sol:157](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157-L159)

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

When  currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0, The borrowed value already includes up-to-date interest from the borrowWithInterestSame function that is called from getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function. Reapplying the interest scaling again using the current borrow index effectively double-counts the interest, leading to a borrowAmount that is larger than it should be.

And when currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0, allows a first-time borrower (with currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0) to borrow with borrowAmount = 0, bypassing any collateral checks and draining funds from the lending pool through an outdated msg.value call.

### Internal Pre-conditions

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0,
1. The user has previously borrowed from the market and currentBorrow.borrowIndex > 0.
2. The contract stores a historical borrowIndex from the last user borrow.
3. The borrow function is called with a non-zero _amount.

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0,
1. {User} needs to call borrow() on an LToken market where they have never previously borrowed.
2. {User} needs to have not supplied any collateral to the protocol.
3. currentBorrow.borrowIndex needs to be exactly 0 for the user in the given LToken market.
4. LToken.borrowIndex() needs to be greater than 0, meaning accrueInterest() must have been called at least once.

### External Pre-conditions

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0,
1. A lending market exists with a valid LToken implementation.
2. The user has already supplied collateral.
3. The LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest() function has been triggered, so the index is up to date.
4. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral returns an already interest-adjusted borrowed.

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0,
1. LToken.borrowIndex() needs to be greater than 0, which occurs after an external actor (e.g., any user or automated service) calls accrueInterest() at least once.
2. No oracle or price feed manipulation is required since the borrow check is bypassed purely due to the internal logic flaw.

### Attack Path

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0,
1. User supplies sufficient collateral.
2. User attempts to borrow a valid amount based on on-chain collateral and borrow limits.
3. The system rejects the borrow due to the artificially inflated borrowAmount, even though the user has enough collateral.
4. The user cannot borrow as much as expected, leading to a denial of service on valid borrowing capacity.

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0,
1. User calls borrow() for the first time on a given lToken, which has a non-zero borrowIndex() (due to accrueInterest() having been called at least once).
2. User has no existing borrow position, so lendStorage.getBorrowBalance() returns a BorrowMarketState with borrowIndex == 0.
3. The check currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 ? (...) : 0 evaluates to 0, setting borrowAmount = 0, and bypasses the collateral requirement.
4. The collateral >= borrowAmount check passes trivially (collateral >= 0), even if the user has no collateral at all.
5. User successfully borrows tokens via LErc20Interface(lToken).borrow(_amount) and receives them with IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount).
6. The user now holds borrowed tokens without having posted any collateral, creating a protocol-wide insolvency risk.

### Impact

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0,
1. Users are prevented from borrowing their full entitlement based on collateral.
2. The protocol underutilizes user collateral, reducing capital efficiency.
3. This may break integrators or frontends that assume accurate borrow limits.

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0,
High / Critical â€” An attacker can borrow unlimited tokens with no collateral, fully draining the lending pool.

### PoC

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0,
Simulate the borrow with the following setup in a test:
Supply collateral to pass the liquidity check.
Call borrow with an amount that should be within limits.
The call fails due to:
        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

despite having sufficient collateral.

When currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0,
Please add this function in TestBorrowing.t.sol.
    function test_borrow_without_supply() public {
        address user1 = makeAddr("user1");
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        (address token,) = _supply(10e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        coreRouter.borrow(1e18, token);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

### Mitigation

In conclusion, Remove these lines.

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
And change this line         require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral"); as a         require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

Then you can solve the both of bugs.
