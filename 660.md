# bad debt is not accounted for during partial liquidation of an insolvent position

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L230-L245
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
        external
    {
        // The lToken of the borrowed asset
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset);


        LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();


        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);


        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }


```
protocol allows for partial liquidation, if a borrowers position is insolvent then a liquidator can liquidate him leaving bad debt to protocol.And there is no bad debt accounting mechanism in protocol, due to which protocol users should bare this bad debt loss 


### Root Cause

no mechanism to account for bad debt .

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

liquidator liquidates a undercollaterized insolvent borrow position due to which bad debt accures.

### Impact

as there is no mechanism to account for bad debt of protocol this loss will be effected to remaining protocol users 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement a mechanism for bad debt accounting
