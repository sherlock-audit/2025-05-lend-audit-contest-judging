# Wrong amount of borrow will be repaid by liquidator during cross-chain liquidation

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidation, the liquidation is initiated by a liquidator on the **destination chain**, where the amount of lToken collateral to seize on the **source chain** is calculated and passed as `payload.amount` in a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message. The source chain then seizes that `payload.amount` of lTokens from the borrower and sends back a `LiquidationSuccess` message to the destination chain.

However, the same `payload.amount` (which represents the amount of collateral seized) is reused in the `LiquidationSuccess` message. In the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function on the destination chain, this value is **wrongly interpreted** as the amount of **borrow** to be repaid by the liquidator. As a result, an incorrect amount is repaid: either more or less than intended. If the amount exceeds the user’s actual borrow, the function will revert, causing a denial of service.

```solidity
// On destination chain
(seizeTokens) = liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(..., repayAmount); 
// Sends seizeTokens as payload.amount

_send(..., seizeTokens, ..., ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute);

// On source chain
// Seizes payload.amount of collateral, then sends it back as-is in LiquidationSuccess

_send(..., payload.amount, ..., ContractType.LiquidationSuccess);

// On destination chain again
repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(..., payload.amount, ...) 
// @audit-issue: payload.amount is incorrectly assumed to be the repayAmount
```

### Root Cause

The `payload.amount` in the `LiquidationSuccess` message is incorrectly interpreted as the borrow amount to be repaid by the liquidator. In reality, it represents the amount of collateral (in lTokens) that was seized on the source chain.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None



### External Pre-conditions

None



### Attack Path

1. Alice has a 5 BTC loan on the destination chain (Arbitrum), which is liquidatable.
2. 1 BTC = $1000, so $5000 worth of cUSDC needs to be seized as collateral from the source chain (Ethereum).
3. The exchange rate of cUSDC market is 0.5. Therefore, 5000 / 0.5 = 10,000 cUSDC should be seized.
4. The destination chain sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message with `payload.amount = 10,000` to the source chain.
5. The source chain seizes 10,000 cUSDC from Alice and sends back a `LiquidationSuccess` message, again with `payload.amount = 10,000`.
6. On the destination chain, `_handleLiquidationSuccess` treats `payload.amount = 10,000` as the **borrow amount** to repay and attempts to deduct it from the liquidator and repay Alice’s debt.
7. Due to this, an incorrect borrow amount will be repaid by the liquidator, potentially resulting in a loss or unintended profit.

### Impact

1. The liquidator will incur a loss in scenarios where they repay more than the intended borrow amount.  
2. The user incurs a loss if the liquidator repays less than the intended borrow amount, because more collateral will be seized while less debt is actually repaid.  
3. If the seized lToken amount is more than the user's total borrow, the `LiquidationSuccess` message will always revert, due to underflow causing a denial of service (DoS).

### PoC

No response


### Mitigation

- The destination chain should not calculate the seize amount  (collateral in lTokens).
- Instead, it should only send the repay amount in the `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message.
- The source chain  should compute the appropriate lToken seize amount based on the repay amount and send only the repay amount back in the `LiquidationSuccess` message.
