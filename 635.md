# Lack of Consideration of the Value of lToken When Distributing Bonds

### Summary
The current implementation distributes Bonds based solely on the amount of lTokens held, without accounting for the actual value of those lTokens. Consequently, a holder of 100 lUSDC will receive the same amount of Bonds as a holder of 100 lETH, despite the significant difference in their underlying values.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function distributeSupplierLend(address lToken, address supplier) external onlyAuthorized {
        // Trigger supply index update
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerSupplyIndexUpdate(lToken);

        // Get the appropriate lend state based on whether it's for supply or borrow
        (uint224 supplyIndex,) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).lendSupplyState(lToken);

        // Get the relevant indexes and accrued LEND for the account
        uint256 supplierIndex = lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier];

        lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier] = supplyIndex;

        // Update the account's index to the current index since we are distributing accrued LEND
        if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
            // Covers the case where users borrowed tokens before the market's borrow state index was set.
            // Rewards the user with LEND accrued from the start of when borrower rewards were first
            // set for the market.
            supplierIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX;
        }

        // Calculate change in the cumulative sum of the LEND per lToken accrued
        Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(supplyIndex, supplierIndex)});

        // Calculate the appropriate account balance and delta based on supply or borrow
        uint256 supplierTokens = totalInvestment[supplier][lToken];

        // Calculate LEND accrued: lTokenAmount * accruedPerLToken
330:    uint256 supplierDelta = mul_(supplierTokens, deltaIndex);

        // Update the accrued LEND for the account
        uint256 supplierAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[supplier], supplierDelta);
        lendAccrued[supplier] = supplierAccrued;
    }
```

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61-L92
```solidity
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        ...
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
88:         msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
        );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L197-L200
```solidity
    function updateTotalInvestment(address user, address lToken, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorized {
        totalInvestment[user][lToken] = amount;
        emit TotalInvestmentUpdated(user, lToken, amount);
    }
```
As shown, `totalInvestment` simply reflects the amount of lTokens held, without considering their respective values.

### Impact
This oversight leads to a situation where users who supply underlying assets with lower value receive a disproportionate benefit, while those supplying higher-value assets incur losses.

### Mitigation
To address this issue, the distribution of Bonds should take into account the actual value of the underlying assets or lTokens. This could involve implementing a valuation mechanism that adjusts the Bond distribution based on the market value of the assets represented by the lTokens.
