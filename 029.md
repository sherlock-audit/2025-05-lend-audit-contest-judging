# `bytes32[]` to `address[]` Cast via Unsafe Assembly lead to undefined behavior in `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function.

### Summary

Unsafe cast of `bytes32[]` to `address[]` type will lead to undefined behavior of the protocol in `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function, as it directly type cast `bytes32[]` returned from `EnumerableSet::values()` into `address[]`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol?plain=1#L394-L395

```solidity
    function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        address account,
        LToken lTokenModify,
        uint256 redeemTokens,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars;

        // Calculate collateral value from supplied assets
@>      address[] memory suppliedAssets = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
@>      address[] memory borrowedAssets = userBorrowedAssets[account].values();
```

### Root Cause

In the `LendStorage` there is mapping to keeping track od user's supplied asset. which is like following

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol?plain=1#L92-L94

```solidity
    // User asset tracking
    mapping(address user => EnumerableSet.AddressSet suppliedLTokens) internal userSuppliedAssets;
    // Only for cross-chain borrows
    mapping(address user => EnumerableSet.AddressSet borrowedLTokens) internal userBorrowedAssets;
```

which maps the user `account` or `address` to `EnumerableSet.AddressSet`. 

In `LendStorage` contract the function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is using `values` function of `EnumerableSet` contract which is like following.

```solidity
    function values(Bytes32Set storage set) internal view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
        bytes32[] memory store = _values(set._inner);
        bytes32[] memory result;

        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            result := store
        }

        return result;
    }
```

As you can see this function is returning `bytes32[]` array by using assambly which casts unsafely `bytes32[]` array. After returning this `bytes32[]` array it is stored in `address[]` array directly without any explicit typecasting in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function. As this automatic typecasting will arise the issue. However `address` in solidity is `20 bytes` and the returned value is in `bytes32` the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral::suppliedAssets` variable will only read `first 20 bytes` of the returned `bytes32` value by the `values` function. another 12 bytes will be ignored. This will results wrong address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol?plain=1#L394-L395

```solidity
@>      address[] memory suppliedAssets = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
@>      address[] memory borrowedAssets = userBorrowedAssets[account].values();
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

1. Read the first 20 bytes of a 32-byte slot as the address.
2. The remaining 12 bytes are ignored.
3. Caues in invalid address stored in variables.
4. Cause the system to revert on usage.

This may not revert immediately. But it leads to:

1. Wrong investment/balance calculations
2. Incorrect liquidity risk checks
3. Broken collateral logic
4. Unexpected failures on interactions with LToken contracts

### PoC

I have uses RemixIDE to simulate it.

Add this code to test weather this kind of type cast is not safe or it can not be done.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract UnsafeEnumerableSetCasting {
    bytes32[] private data;
    address[] public arrayy;

    constructor() {
        data.push(0xa4d56a1f92bc9a3767e35b2f78c0b0d3ccf870e263e618c412a9e5f0bafd09c6);
    }

    function getRawBytes32() external view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
        return data;
    }


    function getUnsafelyCastedAddresses() external view returns (address[] memory) {
        bytes32[] memory store = data;
        bytes32[] memory result;
        assembly {
            result := store
        }
        
@>      arrayy[0] = result[0]; this will throw an error `Type bytes32 is not implicitly convertible to expected type address.` or if converted then it will store only first `20 bytes` of the `bytes32` array and remaining will ignored.
    }   
}

```

### Mitigation

Use explicit type conversion for `address[]` array. the code should be look like as following.

```diff
    function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        address account,
        LToken lTokenModify,
        uint256 redeemTokens,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars;

        // Calculate collateral value from supplied assets
-     address[] memory suppliedAssets = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
+     bytes32[] memory suppliedAssetB = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
+     address[] memory suppliedAssets = new address[](suppliedAssets.length);

+     for (uint256 i=0;i<suppliedAssetB.length; i++) {
+       suppliedAssets[i] = address(uint160(uint256(suppliedAssets[i])));
+     }
```

Also same way for `borrowedAssets`. it can be not that much gas optimised but it is the solution which should be implement.
