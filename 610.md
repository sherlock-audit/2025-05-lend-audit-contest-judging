# Incorrect maxLiquidationAmount Calculation in Cross-Chain Liquidation Validation Prevents Legitimate Liquidations

### Summary

An incorrect filter within the `LendStorage.borrowWithInterest` function, when called by `LendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` in a cross-chain context (`isSameChain = false`), will cause an erroneously low (often zero) `maxLiquidationAmount` to be calculated in `CrossChainRouter._validateAndPrepareLiquidation` for the protocol. This will prevent legitimate liquidations of undercollateralized cross-chain positions for liquidators as the `require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount)` check will improperly fail. This failure to liquidate increases the risk of bad debt for the protocol.


### Root Cause

- In `CrossChainRouter.sol`, within the `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L197C4-L233C6, the call to `lendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(params.borrower, params.borrowedlToken, false)` is made to determine the maximum amount a liquidator can repay.
    ```Solidity
    // In CrossChainRouter.sol/_validateAndPrepareLiquidation
    uint256 maxLiquidationAmount = lendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(
        params.borrower,
        params.borrowedlToken,
        false // cross-chain liquidation
    );
    require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");
    ```
- This `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` function (in `LendStorage.sol`) subsequently calls `borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken)` because the `isSameChain` parameter is `false`.
- The **deeper root cause** lies in `LendStorage.sol` within the `borrowWithInterest` function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497. When handling scenarios presumed to be cross-chain (i.e., when its `collaterals` array branch is executed, which is expected on the debt chain for a cross-chain borrow), it applies an incorrect filter:
    ```Solidity
    // In LendStorage.sol/borrowWithInterest, within the 'else' (collaterals.length > 0) branch:
    if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
        // ... logic to sum borrowedAmount ...
    }
    ```
    This filter `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` means it only sums amounts for positions where both the source of collateral and destination of debt are recorded as the current chain. For a true cross-chain debt (where collateral is on `params.srcEid` (Chain A) and debt is on `currentEid` (Chain B)), `collaterals[i].srcEid` would point to Chain A's EID, not `currentEid`. Thus, actual cross-chain debts are not summed by `borrowWithInterest` when called in this context, leading to `currentBorrow` (within `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`) being calculated as zero or a sum of unrelated positions.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `borrower` has an active cross-chain borrow position: collateral is on source Chain A (identified by `params.srcEid`), and the debt (for `params.borrowedlToken`) exists on the current Chain B (where `CrossChainRouter._validateAndPrepareLiquidation` executes). This debt is recorded in `LendStorage.crossChainCollaterals` on Chain B, with the `srcEid` field of the `Borrow` struct correctly pointing to Chain A.
2.  The `borrower`'s overall cross-chain position becomes undercollateralized and eligible for liquidation.
3.  On Chain B, in `LendStorage.crossChainCollaterals` for the `borrower` and the `params.borrowedlToken`'s underlying, there are no (or very few/small) entries that satisfy the erroneous filter `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid`.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  Market price fluctuations cause the `borrower`'s cross-chain position to become undercollateralized.
2.  A `liquidator` (the `msg.sender` to `liquidateCrossChain`) identifies this liquidatable position and calls `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B, providing a valid `params.repayAmount` (e.g., less than or equal to 50% of the actual current value of the targeted cross-chain debt).


### Attack Path

*(This describes a failure path for a legitimate operation due to the bug)*
1.  A `borrower`'s cross-chain position (collateral on Chain A, debt on Chain B) becomes undercollateralized.
2.  A `liquidator` calls `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain(...)` on Chain B, specifying the `borrower`, the `borrowedAsset` on Chain B, the `lTokenToSeize` on Chain A, the `srcEid` of Chain A, and a `repayAmount` that is valid with respect to the actual debt and close factor.
3.  `liquidateCrossChain` calls the internal function `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation(params)`.
4.  Inside `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation`, the line `maxLiquidationAmount = lendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(params.borrower, params.borrowedlToken, false)` is executed.
5.  `LendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`, due to `isSameChain == false`, calls `lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(params.borrower, params.borrowedlToken)`.
6.  Inside `lendStorage.borrowWithInterest` (executing on Chain B, iterating the `collaterals` array which stores records of debts on Chain B collateralized on other chains):
    * The loop `for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++)` iterates through the borrower's `crossChainCollaterals` records for the specified underlying.
    * The condition `if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)` is checked for each record.
    * For actual cross-chain debt records (where `collaterals[i].srcEid` points to Chain A, which is *not* `currentEid`), this condition evaluates to **false**.
    * Consequently, `borrowedAmount` (the local variable within `borrowWithInterest` used to sum up debts) remains `0` (or sums only unrelated "same-chain-like" records, if any).
7.  `LendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` then returns `(0 * closeFactorMantissa) / 1e18` (or similar based on the near-zero sum), which results in `maxLiquidationAmount` (in `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation`) being `0` or an incorrectly small value.
8.  The subsequent check `require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");` in `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` then fails, because `params.repayAmount` (a positive value) is not less than or equal to the erroneously calculated `maxLiquidationAmount` (likely `0`).
9.  The entire `liquidateCrossChain` transaction reverts.


### Impact

* The protocol **cannot effectively liquidate undercollateralized cross-chain borrow positions** when the liquidation is initiated on the debt chain (Chain B). Legitimate liquidation attempts by liquidators will be incorrectly blocked by the `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` step.
* This failure to liquidate leads to an **increased risk of bad debt accumulation** for the protocol, as risky positions cannot be timely managed through the intended liquidation mechanism.
* Liquidators are prevented from performing their function for these cross-chain positions, which reduces the overall health incentives and risk mitigation capabilities of the protocol. The protocol suffers from holding unliquidated risky debt.
