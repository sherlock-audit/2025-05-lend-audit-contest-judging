# Cross-Chain Liquidation Health Check Bypass in CrossChainRouter.sol

### Summary

Missing health factor validation in cross-chain liquidation flow will cause illegitimate collateral seizure for healthy borrowers as malicious liquidators will bypass liquidation eligibility checks by calling liquidateCrossChain() to liquidate overcollateralized positions without verifying if the borrower's debt exceeds their collateral value.

### Root Cause


In CrossChainRouter.sol:197-233 the _validateAndPrepareLiquidation() function is missing health factor validation that verifies if the borrower's position is actually liquidatable

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L197



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to supply collateral on source chain to set totalInvestment[user][lToken] to be at least 1000e18 tokens
2. User needs to call borrowCrossChain() to set cross-chain borrow position in crossChainCollaterals[borrower][underlying] to be exactly one valid record
3. User needs to maintain healthy collateralization to set collateral value to be at least 150% of borrowed amount (overcollateralized position)
4. Protocol needs to process cross-chain borrow to set borrowIndex and principle values in the collateral record to be exactly valid non-zero amounts
5. Liquidator needs to calculate repay amount to set repayAmount to be at most the close factor limit from getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()

### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero cross-chain messaging needs to maintain connection to set message delivery success rate to be at least 95% during liquidation execution
2. Destination chain gas prices need to be at most 50 gwei to ensure cross-chain liquidation messages can be processed within reasonable costs
3. Cross-chain oracle price feeds need to remain stable to set price deviation to be at most 2% during the liquidation window to avoid price-based liquidation rejections
4. Network congestion on destination chain needs to go from normal to low within the liquidation period to ensure timely message execution

### Attack Path

1. Victim supplies collateral on Chain A by calling supply() with 2000 USDC to establish overcollateralized position
2. Victim initiates cross-chain borrow by calling borrowCrossChain() to borrow 1000 USDT on Chain B using Chain A collateral (200% collateralization - healthy position)
3. Protocol processes cross-chain borrow creating valid borrow record in crossChainCollaterals[victim][underlying] with proper borrowIndex and principle values
4. Liquidator identifies healthy victim position with collateral value ($2000) exceeding debt value ($1000) by monitoring cross-chain borrow events
5. Liquidator calculates maximum repay amount using close factor (typically 50%) to determine repayAmount = 500 USDT (within limits)
6. Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain() with parameters: (victim, 500e18, srcEid, lTokenCollateral, borrowedAsset) to initiate cross-chain liquidation
7. _validateAndPrepareLiquidation() executes performing only basic checks (liquidator ≠ borrower, repayAmount > 0, within close factor) but skipping health factor validation
8. Liquidation proceeds despite healthy position as the missing require(borrowed > collateral) check allows liquidation of overcollateralized positions
9. Protocol calculates seize amount using liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens() determining ~540 USDC collateral to seize (8% liquidation bonus)
10. Cross-chain message sent to Chain A to execute collateral seizure via _handleLiquidationExecute()
11. Victim's collateral transferred to liquidator on Chain A while liquidator's 500 USDT repayment processes on Chain B
12. Liquidator profits 40 USDT (seized 540 USDC - paid 500 USDT) from illegitimate liquidation of healthy position

### Impact

The healthy borrowers suffer an approximate loss of up to 100% of their collateral value. The malicious liquidators gain the seized collateral minus the repaid debt amount, typically earning 5-10% liquidation bonus on positions that should not be liquidatable.

### Mitigation

Add health factor validation to the cross-chain liquidation flow by implementing the same collateral sufficiency check used in same-chain liquidations:

```solidity
function _validateAndPrepareLiquidation(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private view {
    require(params.borrower != msg.sender, "Liquidator cannot be borrower");
    require(params.repayAmount > 0, "Repay amount cannot be zero");

    // Get the lToken for the borrowed asset on this chain
    params.borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(params.borrowedAsset);
    require(params.borrowedlToken != address(0), "Invalid borrowed asset");

    // ... existing code to find borrow position ...

+   // ADD: Health factor validation - ensure position is actually liquidatable
+   (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
+       params.borrower, 
+       LToken(payable(params.borrowedlToken)), 
+       0, 
+       0
+   );
+   require(borrowed > collateral, "Position not liquidatable - insufficient shortfall");

    // Validate liquidation amount against close factor
    uint256 maxLiquidationAmount = lendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(
        params.borrower,
        params.borrowedlToken,
        false // cross-chain liquidation
    );
    require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");
}
```
