# Cross-chain collaterals are wrongly calculated in the borrowWithInterest function

### Summary

The `borrowWithInterest`  function can not correctly calculate the cross-chain collaterals, which affects the entire repayment logic.

### Root Cause

When a user tries to make a cross-chain borrow from source chain A to destination chain B, their `crossChainBorrows` are stored on chain B, and their `crossChainCollaterals `are stored on chain A. The cross-chain collateral is stored during the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function:

```solidity
   lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(
                payload.sender, // user
                destUnderlying,  // underlying
                LendStorage.Borrow({
                   //@audit-issue srcEid != destEid
                    srcEid: srcEid,
                    destEid: currentEid,
                    principle: payload.amount,
                    borrowIndex: currentBorrowIndex,
                    borrowedlToken: payload.destlToken,
                    srcToken: payload.srcToken
                })
            );
```

When the user tries to repay their borrow, the system checks the sum of the cross-chain collaterals on either side. In the `borrowWithInterest` function, while calculating the total collateral, it checks whether:

```solidity
 if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
```

This condition is always false, because `destEid` is always different from `srcEid`. As a result, the amount stored for cross-chain collaterals is never included in the borrow amount calculation, potentially leading to incorrect or failed repayments.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

User should have cross-chain borrow.

### Attack Path

N/A, just need to be called `repayCrossChainBorrow` function.

### Impact

An incorrect calculation of the borrowed amount will be made as the cross-chain collateral is not included. This can potentially lead to incorrect or failed repayments.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Avoid checking if `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` is true. This condition should be rewritten.
