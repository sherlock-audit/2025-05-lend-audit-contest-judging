# `Borrow` can be re-entered leading to draining

## Summary
The borrow function allows users to supply collateral and borrow tokens from the market. However The missing validation for _token in the borrow() function can lead to a drain of tokens in the  market, as an attacker can pass a fake collateral token to get a callback to their fake collateral contract in between the execution after the borrow.

## Root cause
Allowing the user to pass in the _token enables reentrancy, allowing them to call borrow() again. Then when repayBorrow() is called in the reentrant call, the borrowDebt in the vault is set to 0, even though the first call still has not repaid it's BorrowDebt.

## Description
```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

```
As we can see no validation on the token supplied to the contract allowing a malicious user to add an underlying token with a callback to drain protocol

## Impact
Large amount of token can be pulled from the market leading to drain of the borrowed token


## Recommended Mitigation
Add a non-rentrant modifier
