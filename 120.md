# Borrower will lose seized collateral when liquidator repays debt during cross-chain liquidation with an invalid amount

### Summary

The lack of debt amount validation during liquidation success handling will cause a complete loss of seized collateral for liquidators as borrowers can partially repay their debt while cross-chain liquidation is in progress, causing the repayment to revert after collateral has already been transferred

### Root Cause

In a cross-chain liquidation, the liquidator will call `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain()` on the destination chain with a `repayAmount` equal to the borrower's current debt. This will cause the collateral to be seized on the source chain. After the collateral is seized a message is sent to the destination chain to `CrossChainRouter::_handleLiquidationSuccess()`, which calls `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()`.

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:383`, the `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()` function validates that `repayAmountFinal <= borrowedAmount`, reverting in the case `_amount` > `borrowedAmount` (and not equal to `type(uint256).max`). As this revert, the debt is never repaid in the destination chain but the collateral is already seized on the source chain.

### Attack Path

1. **Liquidator calls `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain()`** on Chain B with a `repayAmount` equal to the borrower's current debt
2. **The liquidation validation passes** and a message is sent to Chain A to seize collateral
3. **Borrower observes the pending liquidation** and calls `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` to partially repay their debt, reducing the total borrowed amount
4. **Chain A executes `_handleLiquidationExecute()`** which seizes the calculated collateral amount and sends a `LiquidationSuccess` message back to Chain B
5. **Chain B receives the success message** and calls `_handleLiquidationSuccess()` which attempts to call `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()`
6. **The repayment validation fails** at line 383 because `repayAmountFinal` (original liquidation amount) is now greater than the reduced `borrowedAmount`
7. **The entire liquidation transaction reverts** on Chain B, leaving the debt position unchanged, but the collateral is already seized on the source chain.

### Impact

The liquidator suffers a complete loss of the seized collateral tokens. The borrower retains their debt position despite having their collateral seized, creating an inconsistent state across chains where collateral is lost but debt remains. Also, liquidator got some of the collateral seized.
