# Incorrect chain ID check causes cross-chain borrow data to be skipped, leading to liquidity errors

### Summary

A logic error in `borrowWithInterest()` causes it to skip valid `crossChainBorrow` records. The function incorrectly checks if `srcEid == currentEid`, but borrow records are stored on `destEid` (the current chain). This results in borrow amounts being ignored during liquidity checks, enabling users to redeem more collateral than allowed.

### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol: 489 borrowWithInterest()` function, borrow records are filtered using:

```solidity
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
    Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

    require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
    // Only one mapping should be populated:
    if (borrows.length > 0) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
489            if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                borrowedAmount +=
                    (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
            }
        }
    } 
```

However, borrow records are **stored on the chain where `destEid == currentEid`**, while `srcEid` refers to the chain where the borrow was executed (typically the remote chain).

```solidity
function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // Find the specific borrow record using the new helper
    (bool found, uint256 index) =
        lendStorage.findCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, srcEid, currentEid, payload.destlToken);

    if (found) {
        // Update existing borrow
        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
        userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
        userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;

        // Update in storage
        lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, index, userBorrows[index]);
    } else {
        // Add new borrow record
        lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
            payload.sender,
            payload.srcToken,
            LendStorage.Borrow(
722                srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
            )
        );
    }
```

This causes borrow entries to be **skipped** when viewed from their correct storage location.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user initiates a cross-chain borrow
2. Chain A (collateral chain) stores the borrow record with `destEid == A`, `srcEid == B`
3. `borrowWithInterest()` is called on Chain A

###  External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

1. A user supplies collateral on Chain A and borrows on Chain B
2. A borrow record is stored on Chain A with `srcEid == B`, `destEid == A`
3. Later, the user attempts to redeem or interact with liquidity-sensitive functions on Chain A
4. `borrowWithInterest()` is called
5. Function filters using `srcEid == currentEid`, which fails (since `srcEid == B`)
6. Borrow entry is skipped
7. User is shown lower debt and allowed to redeem excess collateral
8. Protocol becomes undercollateralized

###  Impact

- Users can withdraw too much collateral
- Borrow balances are undercounted
- The protocol can become partially or fully insolvent
- Attackers may bypass liquidation

###  Mitigation

In `borrowWithInterest()`, replace:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
-    if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
+    if (borrows[i].destEid == currentEid) {
        borrowedAmount +=
            (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
    }
}
```

This ensures that only borrow records **stored on the current chain** are considered, which matches the structure of `crossChainBorrows`.
