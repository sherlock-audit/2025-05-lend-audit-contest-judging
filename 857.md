# [M-1] Supplying and borrowing on two different chains cross wise breaks the population Invariant in `LendStorage:getCrossChainCollaterals`.

### Summary

When a user borrows cross chain from chainA to chainB they populate two mappings. They populate `crossChainBorrows` on chainA and `crossChainCollaterals` on chainB. By supplying collateral on both chains and initiating cross chain borrows between said chains both mappings become populated rendering the invariant broken.

### Root Cause

The choice to populate these mappings this way leads to them being read wrong when trying to repay the debt obligation of the user.

1. The `CrossChainRouter:repayCrossChainBorrow` function is called.
2. The function itself calls the `CrossChainRouter:repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` function.
3. Where the `CrossChainRouter:_getBorrowDetails` function is called.

This is where the problem arises because to get the borrow details of a given user we need to loop through the mapping that is supposed to be populated.
A code snippet showing where the code looks for the borrow position of the user:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L402





### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Supplying collateral on `chainA`.
2. Supplying collateral on `chainB`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Liquidity should be provided on both chains so the user can initiate a borrow cross-chain.


### Attack Path

Unintended behavior of the code creates a debt obligation that cannot be repaid by the user.

### Impact

It creates a problem where a user cannot repay what they have borrowed cross-chain leaving them only the option of liquidation by another user.

### PoC

Place the following test `TestLiquidations.t.sol`.

```javascript
   function test_borrowing_on_both_chains_breaks_inv() public
        {
            uint256 supplyAmount = 1e24;
            uint256 borrowAmount = 35e22;

            vm.deal(address(routerA), 1 ether); 
            vm.deal(address(routerB), 1 ether);

            
            (address tokenA, address lTokenA) = _supplyA(deployer, supplyAmount, 0);
            
            (address tokenB, address lTokenB) = _supplyA(address(1), supplyAmount * 2, 1);

            
            (address tokenC, address lTokenC) = _supplyB(deployer, supplyAmount, 0);
            
            (address tokenD, address lTokenD) = _supplyB(address(2), supplyAmount * 2, 1);

            vm.startPrank(deployer);
            
            routerA.borrowCrossChain(borrowAmount, tokenA, CHAIN_B_ID);
            
            routerB.borrowCrossChain(borrowAmount, tokenD, CHAIN_A_ID);
            vm.stopPrank();


            vm.startPrank(deployer);
            
            vm.expectRevert("No matching borrow position found");
            routerA.repayCrossChainBorrow(msg.sender, 5e15, lTokenD, CHAIN_B_ID);
            vm.expectRevert("No matching borrow position found");
            routerB.repayCrossChainBorrow(msg.sender, 5e15, lTokenB, CHAIN_A_ID);
            vm.stopPrank();
            

            uint256 borrowBalanceOfDeployerA = lendStorageA.borrowWithInterest(deployer, lTokenA);
            uint256 borrowBalanceOfDeployerB = lendStorageB.borrowWithInterest(deployer, lTokenC);
            
            uint256 borrowBalanceForBoth = borrowBalanceOfDeployerA + borrowBalanceOfDeployerB;
        
            console2.log("BorrowBalance:", borrowBalanceForBoth);
        
        }
```

### Mitigation

Consider changing the logic around the usage of said mappings  when it comes to a user cross-chain borrowing between two blockchains.
1. Creating a function that restricts the second cross-chain borrow if there is already an existing cross-chain borrower through the verification system implied in the contract.
2. Creating a new entire way of tracking cross-chain borrows.
