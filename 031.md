# Incorrect Debt Calculation Due to Cross-Chain Borrow Index Mismatch

### Summary

The protocol calculates a borrower's cross-chain debt using an index local to the source chain. However, this calculation is flawed because it does not account for the difference between borrow indices on the source and destination chains. This mismatch can result in incorrect debt accounting, causing users to either owe more or less than they actually should.

### Root Cause


The root of the issue lies in the use of the local chain's borrowIndex when computing the debt for cross-chain borrows. Specifically, the debt is calculated using the formula:
`(borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;`

This formula assumes that the index on the source chain (where the borrow occurred) is the same as on the destination chain (where the debt is being calculated), which is not necessarily true. Borrow index could be different for two different chains based on market conditions.


```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        } 
```

`borrowWithInterest` is used inside `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to calculate users total borrow amount. If borrow amount is calculated less than real, attackers can use this to redeem or borrow more tokens for profit.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The function borrowWithInterest() aggregates debt using the borrowIndex() from the current chain, even for borrow records that originated from a different chain.

There is no mechanism to retrieve or synchronize the borrowIndex from the destination chain back to the source chain.

The borrowIndex values can change over time independently on different chains, increasing the risk of debt miscalculation.

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. A user performs a valid borrow on the destination chain.
2. The destination chain sends a validation message to the source chain containing the borrow amount and index.
3. The source chain updates its records and later attempts to calculate the user’s total debt.
4. During this calculation, the source chain uses its local borrowIndex, not the destination chain’s borrowIndex.
5. If the indices diverge (which they often do), the user’s debt will be miscalculated.
6. Depending on the direction of the index change, the user could:
 Be undercharged, potentially enabling exploits.
 Be overcharged, unfairly penalizing users.
7. If users borrow amount is less than expected they can borrow much more tokens and cause a loss for the protocol

### Impact

The accounting mismatch may affect liquidation logic, collateral calculations, and overall system health.

### Mitigation

Introduce a mechanism to retrieve  remote chain’s borrowIndex regularly
