# Division by Zero in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()

### Summary

The liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal() function computes the current borrow amount using a borrow index projection, but it performs a division without validating the denominator:

```solidity
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex()) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```

If borrowBalance.borrowIndex == 0, this results in a division by zero, causing the transaction to revert unexpectedly. This can cause denial-of-service for liquidation attempts under edge cases.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L348

```solidity
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);
...
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex()) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```


### Attack Path

1. A borrower's borrowBalance.borrowIndex is zero due to:

- Uninitialized borrow
- Corrupted storage
- A misconfigured or paused market

2. A liquidator calls liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(...)

3. Division by zero is triggered â†’ entire liquidation fails



### Impact

1. Liquidation is blocked
2. Protocol becomes vulnerable to bad debt accumulation
3. Potential griefing vector where attackers force bad state


### Mitigation

```solidity
require(borrowBalance.borrowIndex != 0, "Invalid borrow index");
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex()) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

```
