# Trust Assumption Vulnerability in CrossChainRouter Integration

### Summary

Missing collateral validation will cause unauthorized borrowing for protocol users as malicious actors will exploit the trusted crossChainRouter to bypass local collateral checks

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol:borrowForCrossChain() function, there is a missing collateral and liquidity validation check that allows borrowing without verifying the borrower has sufficient collateral on the destination chain.

`CoreRouter.sol:L195C1-L205C6`

      function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");

        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");

        require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

        IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    }

`

### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner needs to call setCrossChainRouter() to set the crossChainRouter address to a valid contract

CrossChainRouter needs to be compromised or contain exploitable logic flaws

The borrower needs to have some minimal interaction with the protocol to appear as a valid user

### External Pre-conditions

LayerZero messaging system needs to be operational to facilitate cross-chain communication

Destination chain lToken contract needs to have sufficient liquidity for the borrow operation

Gas fees need to be available for cross-chain message execution

### Attack Path

Attacker identifies vulnerability in CrossChainRouter contract or gains control over it

Attacker calls CrossChainRouter functions that trigger borrowForCrossChain on destination chain

CrossChainRouter calls CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain() with attacker's address and desired borrow amount

CoreRouter executes borrow without checking attacker's collateral on destination chain

Attacker receives borrowed tokens without providing adequate collateral

Protocol suffers bad debt as the borrow is not backed by sufficient collateral

### Impact

The protocol suffers potential unlimited losses depending on available liquidity. The attacker gains borrowed tokens without providing collateral, effectively stealing from the protocol and legitimate users.

```solidity

    require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
    
    // Add collateral check
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        _borrower, LToken(payable(_destlToken)), 0, _amount
    );
    require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
    IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
}
