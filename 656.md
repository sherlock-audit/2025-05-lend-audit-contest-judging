# Liquidation Failure Refund Vulnerability

### Summary

The protocol incorrectly attempts to refund liquidators during failed cross-chain liquidations when no funds were actually pulled from them. This creates a critical vulnerability where malicious actors could exploit the refund mechanism to drain protocol funds.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from incorrect assumptions in the liquidation failure handling:
1. The `_handleLiquidationFailure` function assumes funds were already pulled from the liquidator and need to be refunded

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L478

2. In reality, funds are only pulled during `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal`, which never executes for failed liquidations
3. This creates a mismatch between the protocol's accounting and actual fund movements

`liquidateCrossChain` -> `_executeLiquidationCore` -> send message to collateral chain -> message recieve 

if  _checkLiquidationValid(payload) return true ->  _handleLiquidationExecute(payload, srcEid);
else   _sendLiquidationFailure(payload, srcEid); -> send failure message with `payload.amount` (token that should be seized on this chain but are not)

borrowChain call `_handleLiquidationFailure` and transfer token to liquidator.

At this point  `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` is not call yet so no token are transfer from liquidator

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A cross-chain liquidation attempt fails validation on the collateral chain (Chain A)
2. The failure triggers `_handleLiquidationFailure` on Chain B (borrow chain)
3. The protocol has sufficient reserves of the underlying token


### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero messaging is operational between chains

### Attack Path

1. Attacker initiates a cross-chain liquidation they know will fail
2. The collateral chain rejects the liquidation due to invalid conditions
3. Chain B executes `_handleLiquidationFailure`
4. Protocol transfers free funds to attacker from its reserves
5. Attacker repeats to drain protocol reserves

### Impact

Attackers can drain entire reserves of supported tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Remove the Refund Logic**:
```solidity
function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
    address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);
    emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
}
```

At point repayment are not already initiate and liquidator pay borrowed token only in repayment so no need to refund.
