# Cross-chain TOCTOU - Borrow Collateral Check

**Summary:** The contract relies on a potentially stale collateral value from the source chain (Chain A) when validating a cross-chain borrow request on the destination chain (Chain B), creating a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Detail:** When a user initiates a cross-chain borrow on Chain A, the `borrowCrossChain` function calculates the user's current collateral value on Chain A and sends this value in the LayerZero message to Chain B. The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function on Chain B uses this received, potentially outdated, collateral value (`payload.collateral`) to check if it's sufficient for the requested borrow amount (`totalBorrowed`), without re-validating the real-time collateral status on Chain A.

**Impact:** An attacker can initiate a borrow on Chain A, and while the message is in transit, quickly reduce their collateral on Chain A. Chain B will still process the borrow based on the old, higher collateral value, potentially allowing the user to borrow more than their actual collateral supports, leading to bad debt for the protocol on Chain B.

**Recommendation:** Implement a mechanism to verify the borrower's real-time collateral status on Chain A before executing the borrow on Chain B. This could involve a cross-chain call back to Chain A for verification or using a reliable cross-chain oracle for collateral value.
