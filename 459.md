# Cross-chain collateral borrow calculation uses impossible filtering condition

## Description:
The `borrowWithInterest()` function contains a logical error in the `collaterals` array filtering condition. The function requires both `srcEid` and `destEid` to equal `currentEid`, which represents an impossible condition for cross-chain operations and prevents legitimate debt calculation.

```solidity
/**
 * If borrow initiated on chain A, crossChainBorrows filled on chain A, crossChainCollaterals on chain B
 */
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    // ...
    } else {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
            // @audit impossible condition for cross-chain operations
            if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                borrowedAmount += (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

According to the documentation, when a cross-chain borrow is initiated:
- Collateral is provided on Chain A (`srcEid = Chain A`)
- Borrow is executed on Chain B (`destEid = Chain B`)
- The borrow record is stored in `crossChainCollaterals` on Chain B
The condition `srcEid == currentEid && destEid == currentEid` can only be true when `srcEid == destEid`, which represents a same-chain operation, not a cross-chain borrow.

## Impact:
All cross-chain borrow amounts are excluded from debt calculations
Cross-chain positions cannot be liquidated due to zero reported debt
Users can exceed borrowing limits due to underreported debt

## Recommended Mitigation:
Fix the filtering condition to properly identify cross-chain borrows on the destination chain:
