# Unsafe Liquidation Validation for Deprecated Markets allows Liquidation of healthy positions

### Summary

In `CoreRouter.sol` the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` function bypasses critical liquidation checks when a market is deprecated, allowing unfair liquidations of healthy position.

### Root Cause

Here's the vulnerable code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L223C4-L276C6

the liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function bypass key checks for deprecated markets:

```solidity
function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
    address payable lTokenBorrowed,
    address borrower,
    uint256 repayAmount,
    uint256 collateral,
    uint256 borrowed
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

    // @audit - Only basic check for deprecated markets
    if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
        require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
    } else {
        // Normal markets get full validation
        uint256 borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
        require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
        uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
            Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), 
            borrowBalance.amount
        );
        require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
    }
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Market must be marked as deprecated:
Borrower must have an active loan:
Repay amount must not exceed borrowed amount:


### External Pre-conditions

Price feed must be active to calculate collateral value
Market must have enough liquidity for seize operation
Liquidator must have enough tokens to repay

### Attack Path

Attacker monitors for market deprecation:
```
bool isDeprecated = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed));
```

Upon deprecation, identify healthy positions:

```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    borrower, 
    LToken(lTokenBorrowed), 
    0, 
    0
);
// Even if collateral > borrowed, liquidation will succeed
```

Execute liquidation through liquidateBorrow:
```solidity
coreRouter.liquidateBorrow(
    borrower,
    repayAmount,
    lTokenCollateral,
    borrowedAsset
);
```
Seize collateral at discount:

``` solidity (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
    .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
// Seizes more collateral than should be allowed ```


### Impact

``` solidity 
// Example scenario:
Initial Position:
- Collateral: 100 ETH
- Borrowed: 50 ETH
- Health Factor: 2.0 (healthy)

After Deprecation & Liquidation:
- Liquidator pays: 50 ETH
- Seizes: ~60 ETH (at liquidation discount)
- Borrower loses: ~10 ETH unfairly``
```


Protocol-Wide Effects
Undermines risk management:
```
// Skips critical check
require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

```
Allows liquidation of healthy positions:
```solidity
// No minimum collateral ratio check
if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
    require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
    // That's all that's checked
}
```

3. Financial loss for borrowers with healthy positions due to immediate liquidation without proper collateral ratio checks

4. Potential mass liquidations causing market instability when a token is deprecated
