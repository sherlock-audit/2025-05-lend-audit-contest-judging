# Collateral Check Incorrectly Applies Interest to New Borrow Amount

### Summary

`CoreRouter.sol#borrow()` incorrectly applies interest to the newly requested borrow amount during the collateral sufficiency check. It treats the combined old and new borrow as if both were subject to the prior borrow index, leading to an inflated borrow value. This can prevent users with existing debt from borrowing amounts they should be allowed to, although it does not affect actual borrow state or create financial loss.

### Root Cause

The collateral check uses `lendStorage.sol#getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` to calculate the total borrow amount (existing + new). It then applies an index adjustment to this combined amount using the previous and current borrow indices, as if both the existing and new borrow amounts were subject to the prior borrow index. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L158). This incorrectly applies accrued interest to the new borrow amount, which has not yet accumulated interest. As a result, the user's total borrow is overstated, potentially preventing them from borrowing even when they have sufficient collateral.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has an existing borrow position on the asset (`currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0`).

2. The user attempts to borrow additional amount.

3. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is called to evaluate whether the new borrow would exceed available collateral.

4. After that it uses the previous `borrowIndex` to scale the combined (existing + new) borrow amount.



### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Users with an existing borrow position may be prevented from borrowing additional funds even when their collateral is sufficient. This issue particularly affects users with small prior borrow balances, as the incorrect interest application can disproportionately reduce their borrowing capacity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When checking collateral sufficiency, apply the borrow index adjustment only to the existing borrow amount, then add the new borrow amount without interest.
