# Price Manipulation Vulnerability in SimplePriceOracle

### Summary

The `SimplePriceOracle.sol` contract is vulnerable to price manipulation due to the lack of access control on its `setDirectPrice` function. Any external caller can update the price of an asset, allowing an attacker to arbitrarily set the price of any listed asset. This can lead to severe consequences for the protocol, including but not limited to: incorrect collateral valuations, unbacked liquidations, and potential for draining funds.

### Root Cause

['setDirectPrice:34'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/SimplePriceOracle.sol#L23)Lack of access control mechanism on the `setDirectPrice` function in the `SimplePriceOracle.sol` contract. This function is defined as `public`, allowing anyone to call it and directly update the asset price without identity verification or authorization.

```solidity
function setDirectPrice(address asset, uint256 price) public {
    emit PricePosted(asset, prices[asset], price, price);
    prices[asset] = price;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `SimplePriceOracle` contract has been deployed.
- The asset (e.g., `MockERC20`) whose price will be manipulated is registered in the oracle.
- The lending protocol relies on `SimplePriceOracle` to get asset prices via the `getUnderlyingPrice` function.

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker has a valid Ethereum account (EOA or contract) with sufficient funds to pay for gas fees.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies the vulnerable `SimplePriceOracle` contract and its `setDirectPrice` function.
2. The attacker selects a target asset whose price they want to manipulate (e.g., a collateral token or a borrowed token).
3. The attacker calls the `setDirectPrice` function with the target asset's address and a manipulated price (either artificially inflated or deflated).
4. The `SimplePriceOracle` contract updates the asset's price in the `prices` mapping without authorization validation.
5. The lending protocol, which uses `SimplePriceOracle` for value calculations, will then use this manipulated price.

### Impact

This price manipulation directly affects the core financial metrics of the lending protocol, which can lead to severe consequences:

### Impact on Lending Protocol
`SimplePriceOracle` is crucial in providing the `underlyingPrice` for `LToken` assets via the `getUnderlyingPrice` function. This price is fundamental for calculating:
- **Collateral Value:** The value of assets supplied by users as collateral.
- **Borrowing Capacity:** The maximum amount a user can borrow against their collateral.
- **Account Liquidity:** The health of a user's position, determining if they are undercollateralized and eligible for liquidation.

Therefore, any manipulation of the price returned by `SimplePriceOracle` directly impacts the core financial mechanics of the lending protocol, allowing an attacker to:
- **Artificially Inflate Collateral Value:** By setting a high price for their collateral token, an attacker could borrow more than their actual collateral is worth, leading to undercollateralized loans.
- **Trigger Unbacked Liquidations:** By setting a low price for a borrower's collateral, an attacker could force liquidations and potentially profit from the discrepancy.
- **Disrupt Protocol Stability:** Continuous price manipulation can lead to a loss of trust, financial instability, and potential draining of protocol funds.

### PoC

To demonstrate this vulnerability, a Hardhat test case (`SimplePriceOracle.test.js`) was created. This test simulates an attacker manipulating the price of a `MockERC20` token through the `SimplePriceOracle` contract.

**Scenario:**
1. The `SimplePriceOracle` and mock tokens (`MockERC20`, `MockLToken`) are deployed.
2. The contract owner initially sets a legitimate price for the `MockERC20` token.
3. An attacker, using a separate account, calls `setDirectPrice` to change the price of the `MockERC20` token to an arbitrarily high value (e.g., 1,000,000).
4. The test asserts that the price reported by the oracle indeed reflects the attacker's manipulated price.

**Test Code Snippet (`PoC/test/SimplePriceOracle.test.js`):**
```javascript
  it("manipulates price via setDirectPrice", async () => {
    // initial price = 0
    await oracle.connect(owner).setDirectPrice(await mockToken.getAddress(), 1);
    expect(await oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(await mockLToken.getAddress())).to.equal(1);

    // attacker sets price = 1_000_000
    await oracle.connect(attacker).setDirectPrice(await mockToken.getAddress(), 1_000_000);
    expect(await oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(await mockLToken.getAddress())).to.equal(1_000_000);
  });
```

### Mitigation

Implement robust access control mechanisms for the `setDirectPrice` function. Only authorized entities (e.g., a trusted multi-sig wallet, a governance contract, or a dedicated price oracle administrator) should be able to update asset prices. Consider using roles-based access control (RBAC) or an `onlyOwner`/`onlyRole` modifier.

**Example (using OpenZeppelin's Ownable):**
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract SimplePriceOracle is PriceOracle, Ownable {
    // ... existing code ...

    function setDirectPrice(address asset, uint256 price) public onlyOwner {
        emit PricePosted(asset, prices[asset], price, price);
        prices[asset] = price;
    }
}
```

Additionally, consider implementing a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) mechanism or relying on a decentralized oracle network (e.g., Chainlink, Pyth) to make price feeds more resilient to flash loan attacks and single-point-of-failure manipulations.
