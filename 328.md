# Liquidation can fail permanently due to incorrect `destEid` in `findCrossChainCollateral`, causing liquidator funds to be stuck.

### Summary

The `_handleLiquidationSuccess `function in `CrossChainRouter `calls `findCrossChainCollateral `with `destEid `set to 0. Since `findCrossChainCollateral `only returns true when all fields match, this call will never find the correct collateral entry if the actual `destEid `is not zero. As a result, the function reverts, and `_handleLiquidationFailure `is never called, causing the liquidator’s funds to be stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

When processing a liquidation success message, `_handleLiquidationSuccess` attempts to locate the user’s collateral entry by calling `lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral` with the actual `srcEid `but with `destEid `set to 0. The `findCrossChainCollateral` function requires all provided fields to match the stored entry, so if the actual `destEid `is not zero (which is almost always the case), the function will not find the entry and will return `found = false`. This causes the subsequent `require(found, "Borrow position not found");` to revert. Because the revert happens before `_handleLiquidationFailure `can be called, the liquidator’s repaid funds are left stuck in the contract, and the liquidation process cannot be completed or rolled back.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A positions is eligible for liquidation and  `_handleLiquidationSuccess ` is returned from the other chain.

### External Pre-conditions

The user’s collateral entry exists with a nonzero `destEid`

### Attack Path

1. A liquidator initiates a cross-chain liquidation.
2. The protocol sends a liquidation success message to the collateral chain.
3. `_handleLiquidationSuccess `tries to find the collateral entry using `findCrossChainCollateral `with `destEid` = 0.
4. The function fails to find the entry and returns` found = false`.
5. The function reverts, and `_handleLiquidationFailure `is never called.
6. The liquidator’s funds remain stuck in the contract.

### Impact

The liquidation process reverts and cannot be completed. The liquidator’s funds are stuck in the contract, resulting in a loss for the liquidator.
The protocol cannot finalize or roll back the liquidation, leading to stuck positions and potential bad debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`findCrossChainCollateral`  should not be used with less strict requirements, function can have it's own looping as it is done in `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`.
