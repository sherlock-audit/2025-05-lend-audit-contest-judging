# Unnecassary liquidations can be done due to inconsistency in the `liquidateBorrow` function

### Summary

The `CoreRouter.sol's` `liquidateBorrow` function is used for and ONLY supposed to be used for liquidations in the same chain [natspec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L224). The function after accruing the interest calculates and returns the `borrowedAmount` and `collateral` of the respective borrower, this is done for checking later if the liquidation is valid or not i.e if the borrower's shortfall is sufficient or not, like if the collateral's value has gone down < than the borrowedAmount.
Coming back to the issue. And here it is that to get these `collateral` and `borrowed` values the function calls the internal function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. The issue lies inside this function particularly. As previously mentioned that this `liquidateBorrow` is only for same chain liquidations. However what `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` does is that when computing the `totalBorrows` of the user, the function along with the borrows in the same chain, it also includes and adds up the borrows from the cross-chain borrows too and then returns the amount of user borrows to the function [see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L420C8-L428C72) This can lead to many issues in the liquidation logic specifically.


### Root Cause

In the `liquidateBorrow` thats used for only same chain liquidations, the internal function that it calls- `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` this also includes the borrows done in cross chain.
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
        external
    {
        // The lToken of the borrowed asset
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset);


        LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();


        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0); // AUDIT- This accounts and returns after adding the cross-chain borrows too
```
```solidity
    function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        address account,
        LToken lTokenModify,
        uint256 redeemTokens,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
// SNIP...
            // Add cross-chain borrows if any
            totalBorrow += borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset)); //<-
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The borrower borrows from both sources i.e same chain and the cross chain borrows too

### External Pre-conditions

 liquidator calls the `liquidateBorrow` in the `CoreRouter.sol`

### Attack Path

Lets Suppose:
1. A user borrows some amount of tokens in the same chain and some amount in the cross-chain too.
2. Now if we add up both of those amounts (same chain borrows and cross chain too) it somehow goes below the threshold, meaning that the collateral's value decreased.
3. The liquidator(note that this issue might also occur even without a malicious user) but for example's sake here lets say a malicious liquidator notices the issue described above and executes the `liquidateBorrow` function to liquidate the borrower on the chain

### Impact

The impact can be considered high here as due to the logical issue in the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function even if the borrower is well within the threshold for the same chain borrow , he/she will can get liquidated even so. And that is due to the inconsistency in the function as it takes both of the borrowedAmounts - same chain and the cross chains . so the amount of borrows that will be returned will also include the cross chain borrows too that might end up increasing the amount and the lead to incorrect calculations and comparison of the borrowed and the collateral amount 

### PoC

See the below snippet for seeing that the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` accounts for both of them borrows:
```solidity
    function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        address account,
        LToken lTokenModify,
        uint256 redeemTokens,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars;


        // Calculate collateral value from supplied assets
        address[] memory suppliedAssets = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
        address[] memory borrowedAssets = userBorrowedAssets[account].values();

 // SNIP ..


        // Second loop: Calculate borrow value from borrowed assets
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length;) {
            LToken asset = LToken(borrowedAssets[i]);


            // Get borrow balance for this asset
            uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));


            // Add cross-chain borrows if any
            totalBorrow += borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset)); // <-AUDIT

// SNIP ...
}
```


### Mitigation

Refine the code to such that when liquidating same chain borrows, only compute and return those borrows only ignoring the cross chain borrows
