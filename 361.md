# CrossChain Borrows and Collaterals Invariant Violation

### Summary

The borrowWithInterest() function enforces an invariant:

 ```solidity
require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
```

This invariant is intended to ensure that a given user and token pair cannot simultaneously have active entries in both crossChainBorrows and crossChainCollaterals. However, due to the absence of robust restrictions, simultaneous population of both mappings can occur.



### Root Cause

The functions addCrossChainBorrow and addCrossChainCollateral allow simultaneous updates to crossChainBorrows and crossChainCollaterals without cross-validation or removal of conflicting entries.

This leads to a state where both mappings can be populated for the same user and token pair, violating the invariant enforced in borrowWithInterest().

### Internal Pre-conditions

The system expects only one of crossChainBorrows or crossChainCollaterals to be populated at any given time for a specific user-token pair.

The invariant check in borrowWithInterest() assumes the above condition holds true.

### External Pre-conditions

A user executes simultaneous or sequential calls to addCrossChainBorrow and addCrossChainCollateral for the same token and user.

There is no mechanism to enforce mutual exclusivity between the two mappings.



### Attack Path

The attacker adds a borrow entry using addCrossChainBorrow.

Before the invariant is validated, the attacker adds a collateral entry using addCrossChainCollateral for the same user and token.

The next invocation of borrowWithInterest() will fail the invariant check, causing unintended behavior or incorrect calculations.

### Impact

Protocol Stability: Violating the invariant can cause inconsistencies in borrow or collateral calculations, potentially destabilizing the protocol's state.

Security Risk: Exploiting the inconsistency could allow unauthorized actions, such as improper liquidation or double counting of assets.

Operational Risk: The protocol may enter an invalid state, requiring administrative intervention.



### PoC

```solidity
// Prerequisites
address user = 0x123; // Example user address
address token = 0xABC; // Example token address
LendStorage.Borrow memory borrowEntry = LendStorage.Borrow({
    srcEid: 1,
    destEid: 2,
    principle: 100e18,
    borrowIndex: 1e18,
    borrowedlToken: address(0xDEF),
    srcToken: token
});

LendStorage.Borrow memory collateralEntry = LendStorage.Borrow({
    srcEid: 2,
    destEid: 1,
    principle: 50e18,
    borrowIndex: 1e18,
    borrowedlToken: address(0xDEF),
    srcToken: token
});

// Actions
lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(user, token, borrowEntry);
lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(user, token, collateralEntry);

// Trigger
uint256 borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(user, address(0xDEF));
// Result: "Invariant violated: both mappings populated" is thrown.


```

### Mitigation

Atomic Updates: Ensure that updates to crossChainBorrows and crossChainCollaterals are mutually exclusive. For example:

Adding a borrow entry automatically removes any collateral entries for the same user and token, and vice versa.

Unified Structure: Combine crossChainBorrows and crossChainCollaterals into a single mapping with a type field to distinguish between borrow and collateral.

Validation Hooks: Add checks in addCrossChainBorrow and addCrossChainCollateral to validate the invariant before updating state.
