# There is no reset accrued in the claimLend function, resulting in users being able to reclaim rewards repeatedly

### Summary

In the `claimLend`, the function handles reward distribution via the following loop:

```solidity

for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
    uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
    if (accrued > 0) {
        grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
    }
    unchecked {
        ++j;
    }
}
```
The core issues are:

1.  The `grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued)` function, if the `CoreRouter` contract has an insufficient LEND balance to pay the `accrued` amount, will fail the transfer and return the `amount` that was not successfully transferred (i.e., `accrued`).
2.  The `claimLend` function **does not check the return value of `grantLendInternal`**.
3.  The value of `lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j])` is **not cleared or reduced after a successful transfer in the `grantLendInternal` call**.

### Root Cause

There is no reset accrued in the [claimLend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L400) function, resulting in users being able to reclaim rewards repeatedly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.  User A accumulates `X` LEND rewards through supplying/borrowing, recorded as `lendStorage.lendAccrued(userA) = X`.
2.  The `CoreRouter` contract currently has a LEND balance of `Y`.
3.  User A (or anyone) calls `claimLend` for User A.
    *   **Scenario 1 (Direct cause of re-claim): `Y >= X`**
        *   `grantLendInternal(userA, X)` executes and successfully transfers `X` LEND to User A.
        *   Since `lendStorage.lendAccrued(userA)` is not zeroed out, it remains `X`.
        *   User A calls `claimLend` again.
        *   `lendStorage.lendAccrued(userA)` still returns `X`.
        *   If `CoreRouter` still has enough LEND (or it's subsequently replenished), `grantLendInternal(userA, X)` executes successfully again.
        *   User A has re-claimed `X` LEND. This can be repeated.

### Impact

If the `CoreRouter` contract has an insufficient LEND balance at some point, causing `grantLendInternal` to fail the actual transfer (or partially fail, though the  `grantLendInternal` suggests an all-or-nothing transfer attempt), the user's `lendAccrued` record in `LendStorage` will remain unchanged.

This can lead to the following consequences:

*   **Reward Re-calculation/Re-claim Attempt**: When `claimLend` is called again for the user (either by themselves or another user), the system will re-read the same `lendAccrued` value and attempt distribution again. If the `CoreRouter`'s LEND balance has been replenished by then, the user might successfully claim the rewards they previously couldn't due to insufficient balance. This itself might be intended behavior for retries.
*   **Potential for Actual Duplicate Claims (if `lendAccrued` is not updated correctly after successful transfer)**: The more severe issue is that if `lendAccrued` is not reset to zero after a *successful* LEND transfer, the user can repeatedly call `claimLend`. Each time, as long as `CoreRouter` has enough LEND, they would receive the same "already claimed" amount of `accrued` LEND. This would lead to the protocol over-distributing LEND tokens, causing inflation of LEND and a loss of protocol assets.

**The primary issue is the failure to zero out `lendAccrued` after a successful transfer.** This means even if a user successfully claims their rewards, their `lendAccrued` still reflects that amount. If they (or another process) call `claimLend` again, and `CoreRouter` has sufficient LEND, they can claim the same "previously claimed" reward again. This can be repeated, leading to excessive LEND distribution.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 In the `claimLend` function's loop, after `grantLendInternal` **successfully** transfers LEND to the user, the value of `lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j])` must be immediately updated to 0 (or reduced by the amount successfully transferred).
