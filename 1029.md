# Incorrect maxClose Calculation in Liquidation

## Summary
The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function uses an outdated borrow balance (`borrowBalance.amount`) to calculate `maxClose`, causing the `require(repayAmount <= maxClose)` check to restrict liquidators from repaying the full allowable debt, reducing their liquidation rewards.

## Root Cause
In `Lend-V2.sol`, the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function calculates `maxClose` as the product of `closeFactorMantissa` and `borrowBalance.amount`, which represents the historical borrow amount without accrued interest. However, the liquidation eligibility check (`borrowedAmount > collateral`) uses the current debt with interest (`borrowedAmount`), leading to a mismatch. The `require(repayAmount <= maxClose)` condition prevents liquidators from repaying amounts based on the actual debt, limiting their rewards.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. A borrower needs to have a loan with accrued interest (e.g., 1000 USDC initial debt with `borrowIndex` increased by 10%, resulting in 1100 USDC current debt).
2. The borrower's current debt (`borrowedAmount`) must exceed their collateral value (e.g., 1100 USDC > 1000 USDC) to allow liquidation.
3. A liquidator needs to attempt repaying an amount (`repayAmount`) greater than `maxClose`, calculated as `closeFactorMantissa * borrowBalance.amount` (e.g., 50% * 1000 USDC = 500 USDC).
4. The `closeFactorMantissa` (e.g., 50%) needs to limit the maximum repayable amount.

## External Pre-conditions
1. The underlying token prices (e.g., USDC) need to remain stable to ensure consistent collateral and borrow valuations.
2. The oracle price feed for lTokens needs to be consistent to avoid unrelated reverts.

## Attack Path
1. A borrower borrows 1000 USDC on Chain A for cUSDC, recorded in `borrowBalance.amount` with `borrowIndex = 1e18`. Over time, `borrowIndex` increases to `1.1e18` (10% interest), making the current debt (`borrowedAmount`) 1100 USDC.
2. The borrower's collateral is valued at 1000 USDC (after collateral factor), so `borrowedAmount > collateral` (1100 > 1000), enabling liquidation.
3. A liquidator attempts to liquidate 550 USDC (50% of current debt) via `liquidateBorrow`.
4. The function `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` calculates `maxClose = 0.5 * borrowBalance.amount = 0.5 * 1000 = 500 USDC`.
5. The check `require(repayAmount <= maxClose)` reverts, as `550 > 500`, preventing the liquidator from repaying 550 USDC.
6. The liquidator is restricted to repaying 500 USDC, losing the opportunity to earn a liquidation reward (e.g., 8% of 50 USDC = 4 USDC) on the additional 50 USDC.

## Impact
Liquidators are unfairly restricted from repaying the full allowable debt, losing potential liquidation rewards (e.g., $4 for 50 USDC at 8% incentive), exceeding $10 and 0.01% (e.g., 0.4% of a 1000 USDC debt). This reduces liquidator participation, potentially delaying debt recovery and increasing insolvency risk for the protocol. Borrowers may face prolonged debt exposure due to incomplete liquidations, accruing additional interest. The core liquidation functionality is impaired, as the protocol fails to align `maxClose` with actual debt, undermining liquidator incentives. The issue can affect multiple liquidations and tokens, reducing protocol efficiency.
