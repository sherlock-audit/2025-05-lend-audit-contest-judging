# User will bypass collateral requirements and cause undercollateralized debt for the protocol - ON-SOURCE-CHAIN

### Summary

The incorrect use of [`addUserSuppliedAsset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L170-L174) in [`CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain():130`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L129-L130) will cause an undercollateralized debt situation for the protocol as a borrower will initiate a valid cross-chain borrow, then later borrow additional assets on the same chain using the same collateral, leading to systemic insolvency risk.


### Root Cause

On [`CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain():130`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L129-L130) incorrectly calls:

```solidity
lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
```

This line **adds the user's borrow amount to the supplied assets** , not borrowed assets, even though they are borrowing cross-chain assets. As a result, when calculating liquidity and collateralization during future borrows or liquidations using [`LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385-L467) , the system treats borrowed assets as if they were supplied assets — allowing users to borrow more than their collateral should allow.

This is a **code logic mistake** , not a conceptual one.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Borrower needs to supply ETH on Chain A** to be used as collateral.
2. **Borrower needs to call `borrowCrossChain()` on Chain B** to initiate a borrow backed by collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price oracle must return consistent value across chains during borrow initiation.
2. LayerZero must be working corretly.

### Attack Path

1. **Alice supplies 100 ETH (~$300,000) on Chain A**
	- Recorded via `CoreChainRouter.supply()` and added to `userSuppliedAssets` array → correct behavior

2. **Alice Borrows $200,000 USDC Cross-Chain on Chain B**
	- Calling `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain(200000, USDC, ChainB_EID);` and using ETH on Chain A as collateral 
	- This line runs: `lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);` which incorrectly marks Alice as having **USDC as collateral**
	- System allows borrow because: `collateral = $300,000 ETH + $200,000 USDC = $500,000`

3. **Alice Calls `borrow()` Locally on Chain A**
	- `CoreRouter.borrow(200000, USDC);`
	- System checks: `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(Alice, LToken(USDC), 0, 0)`, it includes:
		- `userSuppliedAssets[Alice]`: ETH
		- Also includes USDC (because `addUserSuppliedAsset()` was mistakenly called earlier)
	- So total collateral = $300,000 ETH + $200,000 USDC = $500,000 in value
	- Since `$500,000 >= $200,000`, borrow is approved

4. Now Alice has `$400,000 USDC` in debt by only supplying 1 ETH (~$300,000), hence undercollateralized.

### Impact

This flaw allows users to use `borrowed assets`'s amount supplied in `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` as collateral, bypassing proper checks. It can lead to undercollateralized positions and systemic insolvency of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L129-L130)  line in `CrossChainRouter.sol:borrowCrossChain()`:

```solidity
lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
```

to

```solidity
lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
```
