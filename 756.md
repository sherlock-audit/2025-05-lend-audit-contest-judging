# Incorrect liquidity check during cross-chain borrows leads to bad debt

### Summary

During cross-chain borrows, the protocol incorrectly sends the **entire collateral amount** (i.e., total supplied value) to the destination chain for liquidity checks, rather than the **available liquidity** (i.e., `collateral - borrowed`). This allows the same collateral to be reused across multiple chains, enabling users to over-borrow and cause bad debt.

```solidity
// Vulnerable section in borrowCrossChain
// Collateral is fetched without accounting for existing borrows
(, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

// Collateral is passed to destination chain, not available liquidity
_send(
    _destEid,
    _amount,
    0,
    collateral,
    msg.sender,
    destLToken,
    address(0),
    _borrowToken,
    ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
);
```

### Root Cause

The function `borrowCrossChain()` sends the user's **total collateral** to the destination chain for liquidity checks, rather than the actual **available liquidity** (i.e., `collateral - borrowed`). This leads to a critical flaw where the same collateral can be reused across multiple chains.

This happens in the following code snippet:

```solidity
// Collateral fetched without deducting borrowed value
(, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

// This full collateral is forwarded to the destination chain for borrow validation
_send(
    _destEid,
    _amount,
    0,
    collateral, // @audit-issue should be available liquidity
    msg.sender,
    destLToken,
    address(0),
    _borrowToken,
    ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
);
```

As a result, destination chains overestimate the borrower’s capacity, allowing repeated borrowing against the same funds. The total borrow across chains can far exceed the actual collateral held on the source chain.

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits $1,000 collateral on Chain A (e.g., Ethereum).
2. She initiates a cross-chain borrow of $750 on Chain B (e.g., Base).  
   - Chain A sends the full $1,000 as “collateral” to Chain B.  
   - Since $1,000 > $750, the borrow succeeds.  
   - Chain A records this in `crossChainBorrows[Alice]`.
3. Alice now has $1,000 collateral and $750 total debt.
4. She initiates another cross-chain borrow of $750 on Chain C (e.g., Arbitrum).  
   - Chain A again sends $1,000 as collateral to Chain C (incorrectly).  
   - Chain C approves the new borrow, as the check passes.  
   - Chain A now has two borrow entries totaling $1,500.
5. Alice repeats this attack across all supported chains.
6. Her total debt becomes uncollateralized, leading to bad debt.

Note: This can be executed in a single transaction using a custom contract that makes multiple `borrowCrossChain()` calls to different chains, bypassing intermediate liquidations.



### Impact

- Users can multiply their borrow capacity by reusing the same collateral across multiple chains.
- Leads to under-collateralized or uncollateralized loans.
- Protocol accrues irrecoverable bad debt.




### PoC

_No response_



### Mitigation

- Instead of sending total collateral to the destination chain, send **available liquidity** (i.e., `collateral - borrowed`).
- Update `borrowCrossChain()` to calculate and forward this correct value.
