# Liquidators Do Not Receive Collateral LTokens Due to Missing Seizure/Transfer Calls in Liquidation Logic

### Summary

The liquidation process, designed to maintain protocol solvency, is critically flawed in both same-chain and cross-chain scenarios. When a liquidation occurs, the respective [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L278) (`CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate` for same-chain and `CrossChainRouter._handleLiquidationExecute` for cross-chain) update internal accounting variables within the `LendStorage` contract. These updates correctly reflect the intended decrease in the borrower's collateral (`totalInvestment`) and the corresponding increase for the liquidator and protocol (`totalInvestment` and `protocolReward`).

However, a crucial step is missing: neither function executes the necessary calls to the actual LToken contract (e.g., `lTokenCollateral.seize(...)` or `lTokenCollateral.transferFrom(...)`) that would transfer ownership of the collateral LTokens from the borrower to the liquidator and the protocol.

As a consequence:
*   Liquidators successfully repay a portion of the borrower's debt using their own funds.
*   Despite `LendStorage` indicating they should receive collateral LTokens, liquidators do not actually receive them because no transfer occurs at the LToken contract level.
*   Borrowers, whose debt has been partially repaid, retain full ownership of their collateral LTokens in the LToken contract, even though `LendStorage` indicates these LTokens have been seized.
*   The protocol also does not receive its share of the seized LTokens.

This discrepancy between `LendStorage`'s internal accounting and the actual LToken balances renders the liquidation mechanism ineffective, financially harms liquidators, unjustly benefits delinquent borrowers, and exposes the protocol to increased risk.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the omission of external calls to the collateral LToken contract within the `CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate` and `CrossChainRouter._handleLiquidationExecute` functions. These functions only update state variables in `LendStorage` to simulate the outcome of a seizure but do not interact with the `lTokenCollateral` (or `payload.destlToken`) contract to perform the actual transfer of LToken ownership (e.g., via a `seize(liquidator, borrower, amount)` method or equivalent ERC20 transfer methods if the LToken contract is acting as an intermediary for the borrower's LTokens).


### Internal Pre-conditions

For `CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate`:
1.  A borrow position is eligible for same-chain liquidation as per `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`.
2.  `LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens()` successfully determines the `seizeTokens` amount.
3.  The borrower's recorded `lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral)` is sufficient to cover the `seizeTokens`.

For `CrossChainRouter._handleLiquidationExecute`:
1.  A valid LayerZero message of type `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` is received on the collateral chain (Chain A).
2.  The `_checkLiquidationValid(payload)` check passes on Chain A, confirming the borrower's position is still liquidatable for `payload.amount` (seizeTokens).
3.  The `payload` contains accurate information regarding the borrower, liquidator, collateral LToken (`payload.destlToken`), and the amount of LTokens to be seized (`payload.amount`).

### External Pre-conditions

For `CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate` (initiated by a liquidator calling `liquidateBorrow`):
1.  A liquidator identifies an undercollateralized borrower.
2.  The liquidator possesses and has approved the `CoreRouter` to spend sufficient underlying tokens of the `borrowedAsset` to cover the `repayAmount`.

For `CrossChainRouter._handleLiquidationExecute` (initiated by a LayerZero message from debt chain):
1.  A liquidator on the debt chain (Chain B) has initiated `liquidateCrossChain`.
2.  The liquidator on Chain B has made arrangements for the repayment of the borrowed asset on Chain B (this typically happens upon successful confirmation from Chain A, meaning their funds are committed).
3.  The LayerZero messaging system successfully relays the liquidation execution message to Chain A.

### Attack Path

This is primarily a protocol malfunction rather than an "attack" in the sense of a malicious actor exploiting a flaw for unintended profit beyond what the broken system allows. The "attacker" here is effectively any liquidator acting in good faith, who then suffers a loss, while the undercollateralized borrower unintentionally benefits.

### Impact

1.  **Direct Financial Loss for Liquidators:** Liquidators spend their assets to repay borrower debts but do not receive the corresponding collateral LTokens, making liquidation economically unviable and disincentivizing this critical risk management role.
2.  **Ineffective Risk Management:** The liquidation mechanism, essential for protocol solvency and stability, fails to function as intended. Bad debt is not effectively covered by collateral seizure.
3.  **Unjust Enrichment of Delinquent Borrowers:** Borrowers who are liquidated have their debts reduced or cleared while retaining their collateral LTokens, unfairly benefiting from the flaw.
4.  **Inconsistent State and System Unreliability:** `LendStorage` reflects a state of LToken ownership that is inconsistent with the actual balances in the LToken contracts. This can lead to cascading issues in other parts of the system that rely on `LendStorage` or LToken balances (e.g., further borrowing capacity calculations, redemptions by liquidators for "phantom" LTokens would fail).
5.  **Increased Protocol Insolvency Risk:** Without effective liquidations, the protocol is more vulnerable to accumulating bad debt, especially during market volatility, potentially leading to insolvency. The protocol also misses out on its share of seized collateral.
6.  **Loss of Confidence:** The failure of such a fundamental mechanism will severely damage user trust and confidence in the protocol's reliability and security.
