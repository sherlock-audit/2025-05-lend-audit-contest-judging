# Incorrect Function Call in `_handleLiquidationSuccess`: Should Use `findCrossChainBorrow` Instead of `findCrossChainCollateral`

## Summary:

The [_handleLiquidationSuccess](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443) function in `CrossChainRouter.sol`, which is executed on Chain A, incorrectly calls `findCrossChainCollateral` to locate cross-chain borrow information. Since Chain A tracks borrow information, it should instead call `findCrossChainBorrow`. This incorrect function call prevents the liquidation process from completing successfully.

## Root Cause:

The `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function is responsible for updating the state after a successful cross-chain liquidation. It's executed on Chain A, where the borrow information is stored. However, it mistakenly calls `findCrossChainCollateral`, which is designed to find collateral information on the destination chain (Chain B).

```solidity
// filepath: src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol
(bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
    payload.sender,
    underlying,
    srcEid,
    0, // Incorrect destEid
    payload.destlToken,
    payload.srcToken
);
```
Since Chain A is where the borrow is recorded, the correct function to use is `findCrossChainBorrow`. This function is specifically designed to locate borrow records based on the user, underlying asset, source chain ID, destination chain ID, and borrowed lToken.

## Attack Path:
1. A user initiates a cross-chain borrow from Chain A to Chain B.
2. The user's position becomes undercollateralized.
3. A liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B.
4. Chain B executes the liquidation and sends a message to Chain A.
5. Chain A receives the message and calls `_handleLiquidationSuccess`.
6. `_handleLiquidationSuccess` incorrectly calls `lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral`.
7. `findCrossChainCollateral` fails to find the borrow record because it's looking for collateral information.
8. The liquidation process halts, and the borrower's debt is not properly cleared.

## Impact
- Liquidation process fails to complete on Chain A.
- Borrower's debt is not properly cleared, leading to potential bad debt.
- The protocol's solvency is threatened due to the accumulation of uncleared debt.

## Mitigation
Modify the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function in `CrossChainRouter.sol` to call `findCrossChainBorrow` instead of `findCrossChainCollateral`.
