# During cross-chain borrow repayments/liqudations same-chain borrows are accidentally being cleared

### Summary

During cross-chain borrow repayments and liquidations, the `CoreRouter.repayCrossChainLiquidation()` function ultimately calls `CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal()` to perform the actual repayment. However, `repayBorrowInternal()` incorrectly reduces or clears the borrower's same-chain borrow position, even when the repayment is for a cross-chain borrow. This logic should only execute if `_isSameChain` is `true`.

### Root Cause

The function `CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal()` unconditionally updates or removes same-chain borrow balances regardless of the `_isSameChain` flag. As a result, same-chain borrows will be cleared  even when repaying a cross-chain borrow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice takes a 10 BTC cross-chain borrow on the ARB (destination chain) backed by collateral on ETH (source chain).
2. Separately, Alice also takes a 10 BTC **same-chain borrow** directly on the ARB chain.
3. Alice then initiates repayment of her cross-chain borrow on ARB.
4. The repayment call invokes `repayBorrowInternal()` with `_isSameChain = false`, but the function still clears/updates same-chain borrow records.
5. This results in Alice's same-chain borrow being mistakenly cleared without repayment, causing 10 BTC of bad debt to the protocol on ARB.

### Impact

An attacker can exploit this logic flaw to clear their same-chain borrow positions without actually repaying them, effectively stealing funds and causing bad debt on the destination chain.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
// repayBorrowInternal should not update same-chain borrow if _isSameChain is false
if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
    lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken); // ‚Üê This affects same-chain borrow state
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
}
```

### Mitigation

Update the `CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal()` logic to ensure that same-chain borrow records are only updated or removed when `_isSameChain` is `true`.
