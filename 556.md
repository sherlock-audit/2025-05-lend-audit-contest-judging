# Missing slippage enforcement in supply and redeem functions

## Title
Missing slippage enforcement in supply and redeem functions

## Summary
In `supply()` and `redeem()` functions users can experience unfavorable exchange rates since there is no any slippage protection mechanisms. Both functions calculate `mintTokens` for `supply()` and `expectedUnderlying` for `redeem()` based on the exchange rate at the time of transaction execution, but do not validate these amounts against user expectations or minimum thresholds. This can result in users receiving significantly fewer tokens than anticipated due to exchange rate fluctuations between transaction submission and execution.

## Root Cause
[`supply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61-L92) function calculate `mintTokens` as follows;
```solidity
        // Get exchange rate before mint
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

[`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100-L138) function calculates `expectedUnderlying` as follows;
```solidity
        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
```
We see that these functions calculate the output tokens without enforcing minimum output amounts

## Internal Pre-conditions
Lack of slippage protection

## External Pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User submits a transaction to either supply or redeem their tokens
2. Exchange rate increases or decreases significantly before user's transaction executes
3. User's transaction executes with the new unfavorable exchange rate
4. User receives significantly fewer or no tokens than expected

## Impact
User loses most of their expected funds.

## POC
Add the following test in test/TestSupplying.t.sol
```solidity
function test_loss_of_funds_on_supply_because_of_lack_of_slippage_protection(uint256 amount) public {
        amount = 1e8;
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        address token = supportedTokens[0];
        address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

        // mint tokens
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, amount);

        // user current balance of token
        uint256 userTokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);

        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);

        // supply tokens as collateral
        coreRouter.supply(amount, token);

        // assert that user has been debited tokens
        assertEq(IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer), userTokenBalance - amount);

        // However, user's investment is 0
        uint256 userInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        assertEq(userInvestment, 0);    

        // user attempts to redeem: expect revert with Zero redeem amount
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Zero redeem amount"));
        coreRouter.redeem(userInvestment, payable(lToken));

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Add the following test in TestRedeeming.t.sol
```solidity
function test_loss_of_funds_on_redeem_because_of_lack_of_slippage_protection(uint256 amount) public {
        amount = 1e20;
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // First supply tokens
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

        // Asser user has positive invetsment
        uint256 userInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        assertGt(userInvestment, 0);

        uint256 redeemAmount = 1e8;

        coreRouter.redeem(redeemAmount, payable(lToken));

        // assert that user's investment reduced by 1e8
        assertEq(lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken), userInvestment - redeemAmount);

        // retrive undelying tokens received by user
        uint256 userTokenBalance = IERC20(lToken).balanceOf(deployer);
        // assert that user received 0
        assertEq(userTokenBalance, 0);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Mitigation
Modify `supply()` and `redeem()` to include `minAmount` parameters
```diff
+   function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token, uint256 minMintTokens) external
```

```diff
+   function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken, uint256 minUnderlying) external
```
