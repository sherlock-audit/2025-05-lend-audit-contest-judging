# Incorrect `maxClose` calculation is done in `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function

### Summary

In `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, `maxClose` is calculated with `borrowBalance.amount` incorrectly.

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L353-L357) function, `maxClose` is calculated with `borrowBalance.amount` incorrectly:

```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // Determine borrowIndex and borrowAmount based on chain type
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

        // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
@>          uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
@>              Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
            );

@>          require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
        }

        return 0;
    }
```

`borrowBalance.amount` is the value that doesn't reflect the current borrow index of `lTokenBorrowed`.

Correct calculation of `maxClose` should be done with `borrowBalance.amount * borrowBalance.borrowIndex / LToken.borrowIndex`.

### Attack Path

No response

### Impact

Calculated `maxClose` is smaller than correct value and this leads to unexpected revert of "Too much repay".

For example, following case will revert even though `repayAmount` doesn't exceed `maxClose`:

- `maxClose` with `borrowBalance.amount` is 100.
- `repayAmount` is 105.
- correct `maxClose` is 110.


### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Update `maxClose` logic with `borrowBalance.amount * borrowBalance.borrowIndex / LToken.borrowIndex`.
