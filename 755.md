### Attack Path

Assume that there are two (2) chains - Chain A and B.

1. Alice supplied and minted 1000 USD worth of USDC-lToken (or lUSDC) in Chain A. Alice's total investment in Chain A will be set to 1000 USD worth of lUSDC.

2. Bob supplied and minted 1000 USD worth of USDC-lToken (or lUSDC) Chain B. Bob's total investment in Chain B will be set to 1000 USD worth of lUSDC.

3. Bob initiates a cross-chain borrowing to use his collateral in Chain B to borrow assets (ETH) in Chain A. Thus, he called the Chain B's `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` function.
4. When the cross-chain borrowing message arrived in Chain A, the `CrossChainRouter_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest() -> CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain() -> LErc20.borrow()` function will be executed on Chain A.
5. When `LErc20.borrow()` is executed in Chain A, it effectively uses Alice's collateral to borrow. Bob received his ETH in his Chain A's wallet.
6. Alice wants to redeem all his investment in Chain A. Thus, she calls the `CoreRouter.redeem()` function in Chain A. However, the problem is that Line 121 below within the `redeem()` function will revert because her supplied collateral has already been used earlier to collateralize Bob's debt/borrowing position. Thus, she cannot redeem her investment.

```solidity
File: CoreRouter.sol
100:     function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
..SNIP..
120:         // Perform redeem
121:         require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
```

Note: A crucial point in understanding the bugs is that when the `CoreRouter` interacts with the Compound V2 codebase (e.g., calling `LErc20.borrow()` and `LErc20.redeem()`), it is actually interacting as `CoreRouter` address and not the address of the users. Thus, the Compound V2 codebase only sees a single entity or account that is the `CoreRouter`.

Another worst scenario can possibly occur to Alice. If the value of her collateral drops slightly in Chain A, due to Bob's existing borrowing position or debt, the `CoreRouter` account can go underwater/undercollateralized, and be subjected to liquidation. In this case, some malicious user can liquidate `CoreRouter` via the Compound V2's default liquidation function. In this case, all Alice's collateral will be lost and seized by the liquidator.

### Impact

Loss of assets as shown in the scenarios above.
