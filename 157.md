# Stale-rate payout error in CoreRouter.redeem()

### Summary

*Taking a pre-redeem exchange-rate snapshot* will cause **systematic under-payment of underlying tokens** for **any user who redeems lTokens**, as the **CoreRouter** will *first* redeem with `LToken` at a **fresh (higher) rate** but *then* pay the user with an **out-of-date (lower) rate**.

### Root Cause

* **In `CoreRouter.sol:`** the router reads `exchangeRateStored()` **before** calling `LToken.redeem()`, derives

  and immediately uses that value to `transfer()` funds to the user.
* **In `LToken.sol** (`redeemInternal → redeemFresh`) the `redeem()` path begins with `accrueInterest();` and recalculates the exchange rate, so the amount of underlying returned to CoreRouter is **`_amount × rate_after`**, which is almost always **greater** than `expectedUnderlying`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A holder calls `CoreRouter.redeem(redeemTokens, lToken)` with `redeemTokens > 0`.
2. `LToken.redeem()` performs `accrueInterest()` (always true) so `exchangeRate_after > exchangeRate_before`.
3. CoreRouter pays the user based on the stale `exchangeRate_before`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path


1. **User** submits a redeem for `T` lTokens through CoreRouter.
2. `LToken.redeem()` accrues interest and transfers
   `redeemAmount = T × rate_after / 1e18` to CoreRouter.
3. CoreRouter pays the user
   `expectedUnderlying = T × rate_before / 1e18`.
4. Difference `D = redeemAmount – expectedUnderlying` accumulates inside CoreRouter; the user is short-changed by `D`.


### Impact


Over many redemptions this silently transfers **all interest-accrual delta** from users to the protocol (or, in a rare negative-rate swing, leaves the protocol under-collateralised).


### PoC

Similar to #1 

### Mitigation

Compute exchangeRateCurrent() after redeem() and recalculate
