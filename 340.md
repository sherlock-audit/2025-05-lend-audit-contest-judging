# No way to withdraw protocol rewards for the admin

### Summary

During liquidations, 2.8% of the seized lTokens are allocated to the protocol as protocol rewards. These rewards are stored in the `protocolReward` mapping. However, the protocol lacks any function that allows the admin to withdraw these accumulated rewards. As a result, these lTokens become locked and inaccessible, rendering them unusable by the protocol.

```solidity
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
        address sender,
        address borrower,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address borrowedlToken,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) internal {
        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");

        // Revert if borrower's collateral token balance < seizeTokens
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) >= seizeTokens, "Insufficient collateral");

        uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

        // Just for safety, never expected to occur
        if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
            currentReward = 0;
        }

        // Update protocol reward
        lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
 ...
}
```

### Root Cause

The protocol does not have a function to withdraw or manage the lToken rewards stored in `protocolReward`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Multiple users are liquidated, and 2.8% of the seized lTokens from each liquidation are stored as protocol rewards.
2. These rewards accumulate in the `protocolReward` mapping.
3. Over time, this results in a significant amount of idle lTokens.
4. Since there is no admin-accessible function to withdraw or utilize these tokens, they remain locked in the contract.
5. The protocol effectively loses its earned rewards

### Impact

protocol rewards will be stuck in the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement an admin-only function that allows withdrawal of the lToken rewards accumulated in the `protocolReward` mapping.
