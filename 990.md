# Incorrect Refund in Cross-Chain Liquidation Failure

## Summary
The `_handleLiquidationFailure` function on Chain A erroneously transfers tokens to the liquidator when a cross-chain liquidation fails on Chain B, despite the liquidator not having paid any funds, as payment is only required upon successful liquidation. This allows liquidators to drain protocol funds, causing significant financial loss.

## Root Cause
In `CrossChainRouter.sol`, the `_handleLiquidationFailure` function on Chain A calls `IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount)` to refund the liquidator when a liquidation fails, as signaled by `_sendLiquidationFailure` from Chain B. However, the liquidator only pays funds during a successful liquidation via `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal`, so no funds are escrowed for failed liquidations. The failure can occur if `_checkLiquidationValid` on Chain B returns `false`, e.g., due to the borrower repaying the loan before the liquidation message is processed.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. A borrower needs to have a cross-chain loan on Chain B (e.g., 750 USDC for cUSDC) with collateral on Chain A (e.g., 1000 USDC).
2. A liquidator needs to initiate a cross-chain liquidation on Chain A for a portion of the loan (e.g., 500 USDC).
3. The borrower needs to repay the loan on Chain B (e.g., 750 USDC) before the liquidation message is processed, causing `_checkLiquidationValid` to fail.
4. The contract on Chain A needs to have sufficient balance of the underlying token (e.g., USDC) to process the erroneous refund.

## External Pre-conditions
1. The underlying token prices (e.g., USDC) need to remain stable to ensure consistent collateral and borrow valuations.
2. The LayerZero V2 network needs to process cross-chain messages with minimal delay, allowing the borrower to repay the loan during the message transit.
3. The oracle price feed for lTokens needs to be consistent to avoid unrelated reverts.

## Attack Path
1. A borrower supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A and borrows 750 USDC cross-chain on Chain B for cUSDC.
2. A liquidator initiates a cross-chain liquidation on Chain A for 500 USDC, sending a message to Chain B via `_executeLiquidationCore`.
3. Before the message is processed on Chain B, the borrower repays the 750 USDC loan on Chain B, reducing their borrow balance to 0.
4. Chain B processes the liquidation message and calls `_checkLiquidationValid`, which returns `false` because `borrowed = 0` and `collateral = 1000 USDC`.
5. Chain B sends a `_sendLiquidationFailure` message to Chain A.
6. Chain A calls `_handleLiquidationFailure`, transferring 500 USDC to the liquidator via `IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer`, despite the liquidator not having paid any funds.
7. The liquidator gains 500 USDC, and the protocol loses 500 USDC from its reserves.

## Impact
The protocol suffers a significant financial loss by erroneously transferring tokens to the liquidator (e.g., $500 for a 500 USDC liquidation attempt), representing 5% of a $10,000 pool or 1% of a $50,000 pool, exceeding the 1% threshold. Malicious liquidators can repeatedly exploit this by initiating failed liquidations, especially if coordinated with borrowers who repay loans in time, draining protocol reserves. Honest users face reduced pool liquidity and increased insolvency risk, while the core cross-chain liquidation functionality is critically broken, allowing unauthorized fund withdrawals. The issue can be repeated across multiple liquidations and tokens, amplifying losses and destabilizing the protocol.

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy Lend-V2 on two chains: Chain A (collateral) and Chain B (borrowing). A borrower supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A in a cUSDC pool with a 75% collateral factor and borrows 750 USDC cross-chain on Chain B.
- A liquidator initiates a cross-chain liquidation on Chain A for 500 USDC, sending a message to Chain B.
- The borrower repays the 750 USDC loan on Chain B before the message is processed, reducing `borrowed` to 0.
- Chain B calls `_checkLiquidationValid`, which fails (`borrowed = 0`, `collateral = 1000 USDC`), triggering `_sendLiquidationFailure`.
- Chain A processes the failure message, calling `_handleLiquidationFailure`, which transfers 500 USDC to the liquidator.
- The protocol loses $500 (5% of a $10,000 pool), and the liquidator gains 500 USDC without paying, meeting high severity.
- For a $50,000 pool, a 500 USDC loss is 1%, and repeated attempts (e.g., 10 liquidations) could drain $5000 (10%), confirming critical impact.

## Mitigation
Prevent erroneous refunds in `_handleLiquidationFailure` by removing the `safeTransfer` call, as no funds are escrowed for failed liquidations. Track liquidator payments explicitly during successful liquidations only. 
Add validation in `_executeLiquidationCore` on Chain A to ensure liquidator funds are only escrowed upon successful repayment confirmation from Chain B. Alternatively, implement a state-tracking mechanism to confirm liquidator payment status before processing failure messages.
