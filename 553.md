# The protocol was unable to transfer USDT because of the wrong interface.

### Summary

The protocol was unable to transfer USDT because of the wrong interface. The `redeem` function attempts to transfer tokens using the standard `IERC20.transfer()` function, which will **fail silently** when `_token` is USDT (Tether). This occurs because:  USDTâ€™s ERC20 implementation **does not return a boolean** on `transfer()` (unlike standard ERC20 tokens).  
```solidity
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

### Root Cause

In the [redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170) function, the protocol was unable to transfer USDT because of the wrong interface.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user supplies USDT.
2. Users cannot withdraw funds through `redeem`, and the funds will be locked.

### Impact

**Funds Locked** : USDT transfers fail, locking tokens in the contract. 
**Broken Functionality** : Users cannot withdraw USDT, breaking core protocol logic. 
**Reentrancy Risk** : Improper handling may expose the contract to reentrancy attacks. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library for all ERC20 token operations
