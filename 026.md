# Due to improper handling of the borrowedAmount value, users may end up paying more than expected

### Summary

When a user attempts to repay a loan, the `repayBorrowInternal()` function is called internally. Since an incorrect borrowedAmount value is set in this function, the user may end up paying more than they should.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }

        require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");

        uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

        // Transfer tokens from the liquidator to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);

        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

        // Repay borrowed tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");

        // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }

        // Emit RepaySuccess event
        emit RepaySuccess(borrower, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);
    }

```
The `repayBorrowInternal()` function sets the repayAmountFinal using the borrowedAmount if the _amount value is equal to `type(uint256).max.`

This design ensures that if the `_amount` provided is greater than the user's borrowed amount, it uses `borrowedAmount` instead, so the user only repays the exact debt. Conversely, if _amount is less than the borrowed amount, it allows partial repayment using _amount.

However, the function does not check whether `_amount` is greater than or equal to `borrowedAmount`. As a result, if a user passes a value where `_amount > borrowedAmount`, the user may end up transferring more than expected.

The design should ensure that if the `_amount` value is greater than the `borrowedAmount`, the borrowedAmount is used instead.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The CoreRouter and CrossChainRouter contracts must be deployed and actively providing protocol functionality to users.

### External Pre-conditions

- The user must have an active loan through the protocol.

### Attack Path

1. The user borrows funds using the `borrow()` function.
2. The user inputs an amount greater than the loan amount when using the repayment function.
3. As a result, the user should be guaranteed to spend no more than the original loan amount, but this is not enforced, leading to additional loss.

### Impact

Due to improper handling of the borrowedAmount value, users may end up paying more than expected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount > borrowedAmount  ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```
