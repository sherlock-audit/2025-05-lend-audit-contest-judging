# Incorrect Decimals Assumption for Collateral Tokens

### Summary

### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
Whitelisted only (e.g BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT). ERC20 standard.

The protocol allows only a set of whitelisted tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT) and assumes they comply with the ERC20 standard.

However, from the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-nayashi002), it is evident that the protocol is designed to support multiple collateral tokens beyond ETH. A critical flaw lies in the assumption that all tokens have 18 decimals. This is incorrect for assets like USDC and USDT, which have only 6 decimals.

This assumption leads to incorrect calculations in multiple areas, such as:

When calculating mintTokens during collateral supply:
[CoreRouter.sol#L80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80)

When determining the expectedUnderlying during redemption:
[CoreRouter.sol#L118](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118)

Both rely on hardcoded 1e18 scaling, which breaks accuracy for tokens with fewer decimals

### Root Cause

In both the [supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61) and [redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L94-L138) functions each uses a scaling `1e18` to mint and when redeeming which causes users to receieve less tokens and in some cases render them unable to redeem

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

1. User interacts with both `supply` and `redeem` function in the `CoreRouter` redeem and supply function

### Attack Path

1. consider Alice depositing 100 Dai with 18 decimal in the `CoreRouter.supply` and suppose the exchangeRate for Dai to is 2e18
2. Alice mint token is (100e18 * 1e18) / 2e18 = 50e18;
3. Suppose time passed and Alice decides to withdraw the inverse formular is used.
4. Alice underlying is now (50e18 * 2e18) / 1e18 = 100e18 (plus any accrued interest).
5. Suppose Bob with USDC wishes to do the same and the market rate of USDC:DAI is still 1:1
6. Bob supply USDC and hence mint tokens = (100e6 * 1e18) / 2e18 = 50e6.
7. Bob receives far less tokens than Alice.
8. If bob decides to redeem the check (collateral >= borrowed) fails in the [redeem function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L112) 

### Impact

1. Users with tokens having decimals other than 18 (e.g., USDC, USDT with 6 decimals) experience incorrect accounting of their supplied collateral.

2. The protocol underestimates usersâ€™ collateral balances because it stores and compares values without adjusting for token decimals.

3. This causes the collateral check (collateral >= borrowed) to fail erroneously, preventing legitimate redemptions.

4. Users cannot withdraw their supplied tokens despite having sufficient collateral, causing a denial of service on withdrawals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the contract logic to dynamically handle token decimals instead of assuming 18 decimals.
