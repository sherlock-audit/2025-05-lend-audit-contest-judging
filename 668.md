# Double Counting Interest in Collateral Check Due to Redundant Index Scaling

### Title
Double Counting Interest in Collateral Check Due to Redundant Index Scaling

### Severity
High

### Impact
High - The collateral adequacy check becomes overly restrictive, potentially preventing valid borrows even when a user’s collateral truly covers their debt. Because borrowAmount is computed by applying the borrow‐index scaling twice, it overstates the borrower’s up-to-date debt. Legitimate borrowers with sufficient collateral may be blocked from borrowing or may appear under-collateralized, disrupting normal lending operations.

### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol, Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol

## Description
In CoreRouter.borrow, the code first calls:
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
```
Here, the helper `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` computes borrowed by summing:
1.	borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset)), which returns:
`storedPrincipal x currentBorrowIndex / storedBorrowIndex`
2.	`borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset))` for any cross-chain debt, which also performs the same index-scaling logic.

Thus, the returned borrowed value already equals the borrower’s total `principal × (currentIndex / storedIndex)`, i.e. the up-to-date debt including interest.

Immediately afterward, the code does:
```solidity
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? (borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
Since borrowed already has the factor `currentIndex / storedIndex` baked in, multiplying it again by `currentIndex / storedIndex` effectively applies `currentIndex / storedIndex` twice.

Because of this, the check:
```solidity
require(collateral >= borrowAmount);
```
is comparing collateral against an inflated debt figure, potentially failing even if `collateral ≥ trueDebt`.


## Exploit Scenario
1.	Alice has previously borrowed 100 DAI from Market X when the borrow-index was 1.02. Time passes and the current borrow-index rises to 1.05, so her actual debt (principal × index ratio) is now
100 x 1.05 / 1.02} ~ 102.94 DAI.
2.	She has $110 worth of collateral, which is sufficient for a new borrow.
3.	Alice attempts to borrow an additional 10 DAI. The helper call returns borrowed ≈ 102.94.
4.	The code then computes
borrowAmount
= 102.94 x 1.05 /1.02 ~ 105.90 DAI.
5.	The router checks `collateral (110) ≥ borrowAmount (105.90)`. This passes (110 ≥ 105.90). However, if Alice’s collateral were slightly lower—say $105—then 105 ≥ 105.90 would fail, even though her true debt (≈ 102.94 DAI) plus the new 10 DAI borrow (total ≈ 112.94 DAI) against $105 collateral might actually be acceptable given correct index logic. In practice, smaller margin borrowers can be incorrectly blocked.

## Recommendations
once you have:
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...);
```
and you know that borrowed already includes all accrued interest, there’s no need to re‐apply (currentIndex / storedIndex) a second time.
