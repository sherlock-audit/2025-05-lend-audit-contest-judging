# Incorrect borrow amount calculation allows potential undercollateralized loans

## Description:
The `borrow()` function in CoreRouter.sol contains a critical logic error in calculating the user's current debt for collateral verification. The function incorrectly uses the `borrowed` variable from the hypothetical liquidity calculation instead of the user's actual current debt amount.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ... other code ...
    
    // Gets hypothetical values AFTER the new borrow (includes new loan)
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

    // Gets current borrow state BEFORE the new loan
    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

    // VULNERABILITY: Uses 'borrowed' (future state) instead of 'currentBorrow.amount' (current state)
    uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
        ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
        : 0;

    require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```

The issue is that `borrowed` already includes the new loan amount (`_amount`) from the hypothetical calculation, while the function should only calculate the current debt with accrued interest before adding the new loan.

## Attack path:
1. Attacker has existing debt in the protocol with accrued interest
2. Attacker calls `borrow()` with a new loan amount
3. The function calculates `borrowAmount` using the wrong variable (`borrowed` instead of `currentBorrow.amount`)
4. This results in applying the interest rate multiplication to a value that already includes the new loan
5. The attacker receives tokens while potentially being undercollateralized

## Impact:
The protocol may approve loans that exceed safe collateralization ratios
Users could become undercollateralized without proper validation
Potential protocol insolvency if multiple users exploit this vulnerability

## Recommended Mitigation:
Replace the incorrect calculation with the proper formula that uses the current debt amount
