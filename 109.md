# `seizeTokens` are calculated with incorrect exchange rate during cross-chain liquidations.

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidations, the amount of lTokens to seize on the source chain (where the collateral exists) is incorrectly calculated using the exchange rate of the corresponding market on the destination chain. This is problematic because the exchange rate of a market on the source chain may differ from that on the destination chain, leading to incorrect seizure amounts. 

```solidity

function _executeLiquidationCore(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private {
    // Calculate seize tokens
    address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(params.borrowedAsset);

    // @audit-issue The amount of cTokens to seize on the source chain is being calculated on the destination chain,
    // which is incorrect because exchange rates may differ between chains.
    (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
        .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, params.lTokenToSeize, params.repayAmount);

    require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Seize calculation failed");

    // Send message to the source chain to execute the seize
    _send(
        params.srcEid,
        seizeTokens,
        params.storedBorrowIndex,
        0,
        params.borrower,
        lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to source chain version of LToken before sending
        msg.sender,
        params.borrowedAsset,
        ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
    );
}

```

### Root Cause

The amount of lTokens to seize on the source chain market is calculated using the exchange rate from the destination chain. Since exchange rates may differ between chains, this results in either more or less collateral being seized than intended.

### Attack Path

### Attack Path

1. An attacker has a $500 BTC loan on the destination chain (Arbitrum), which was originated from the source chain (Ethereum), and is in a liquidatable state.  
2. To liquidate the loan, $500 worth of the user’s collateral on the source chain (Ethereum) must be seized.  
3. Assume 1 BTC = $1000, and the user has 500 USDC as collateral on Ethereum.  
4. The exchange rate of the cUSDC market on Arbitrum (destination chain) is 0.5, while on Ethereum (source chain), it is 0.25.  
5. Because the seizure amount is currently calculated on Arbitrum, the contract computes: 500 / 0.5 = 1000 cUSDC.  
6. As a result, 1000 cUSDC will be seized on Ethereum. However, with an exchange rate of 0.25, this amounts to only 1000 * 0.25 = 250 USDC — which is insufficient. The correct amount to seize is 500 / 0.25 = 2000 cUSDC.  
7. In this case, too little collateral is seized, resulting in a loss to the liquidator. In the opposite scenario, if the exchange rate on Ethereum is higher than that on Arbitrum, more collateral than necessary will be seized, causing a loss to the user.


### Impact

An incorrect amount of user cTokens will be seized during cross-chain liquidation, leading to financial loss for either the liquidator or the user, depending on the direction of the exchange rate mismatch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of calculating seizeTokens on the destination chain , the calculation should be performed on the source chain using the actual exchange rate from that chain by getting the actual borrow amount from destination chain.
