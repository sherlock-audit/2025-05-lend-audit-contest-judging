# Incorrect User Asset Tracking Cleanup in Cross-Chain Repayment

### Summary

The `_updateRepaymentState` function removes users from `userBorrowedAssets` tracking based solely on cross-chain debt count, without checking if they have remaining same-chain debts for the same token. This causes users to be incorrectly removed from borrowed asset tracking while still having outstanding same-chain debt, leading to inconsistent protocol state and potential risk calculation errors.


### Root Cause

In [`_updateRepaymentState`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L521) , and `_handleDestRepayMessage` the cleanup logic only considers cross-chain debt positions:
```javascript
function _updateRepaymentState(...) private {
    LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCrossChainCollaterals = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(borrower, _token);

    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
        
        // BUG: Only checks cross-chain debt count, ignores same-chain debt
        if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        }
    }
}
```
and same in `_handleDestRepayMessage`. 
The condition `userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1` or [`userBorrows.length == 1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L556) only verifies this was the user's last cross-chain debt position, but fails to check if the user has remaining same-chain debt in `borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken]`.



### Internal Pre-conditions

User must have both same-chain and cross-chain debt for the same token


### External Pre-conditions

User must have sufficient tokens to repay the cross-chain debt



### Attack Path

- Attacker have both same-chain and cross-chain debt for the same token
- Attacker repay his unique `crosschainBorrow` and it triggers removing `UserBorrowedAsset`
- Attacker tries to borrow again, since the check against the collateral is used through looping [`borrowedAssets`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L395)
the same chain borrows are not taken in consideration and the attacker can overborrow

### Impact

Overborrowing leads directly to drain of funds and protocol insolvency

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I feel like the whole implemenation should be changed: take into account same chain borrows.
