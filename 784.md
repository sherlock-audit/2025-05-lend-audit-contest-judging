# Lack of slippage in regards to `exchangeRatio()` in `supply()`

### Summary

We can see that in `supply()`, there is a calculation [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74-L80) to calculate the amount of minted tokens to give to the user, but there is no slippage to prevent user getting a lesser amount of minted tokens, which can easily happen if someone monitors the chain and decides to supply a very big amount (whale or a flash loan) to skew up the exchange ratio and them `redeem()`  to get his tokens back for almost no cost (gas fees)

### Root Cause

Lack of a slippage parameter to safeguard the user from big exchange ratio changes while his tx is being processed

### Internal Pre-conditions

someone monitoring the chain or exchange ratio movements to skew up the expected exchange ratio

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User calls `supply()` with $1000 of loan token in order to get let's say... 100 minted tokens
2. Alice monitors that and frontruns the tx with $1.000.000 of funds to skew up big the exchange ratio
3. User gets much much less than expected
4. Alice makes a second tx and sandwiches the User, leaving him with a much smaller amount of tokens

### Impact

User getting much less minted tokens, user has a much smaller `totalInvestment()`, loss of funds - high severity

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage param in order to safeguard the user from such scenarios
