# The `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` function is payable, but the `msg.value` is never used

## Summary

The [`CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113C5-L113C7) function is payable, but the protocol's design choice is to use the balance of the protocol not the provided `msg.value`. This can lead to situations where the user sends  a `msg.value` and expects that the left fees will be returned back to him, but this never occurs.

## Root Cause

The `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` function is payable and in the normal circumstances it is expected that the user pays for the message fee:

```solidity

 function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable 

```

But the protocol team said in Discord that it is a design choice the protocol to pays for the fees. The problem is that the users can send `msg.value` to the function and expect then to receive back the left amount of the `msg.value`. But the LayerZero returns the left amount to the protocol and the protocol returns nothing to the users. In that way if the users send funds to the protocol, they will be lost forever. We can see also that the cross chain liquidation function is not payable and there is no possibility for the caller to send funds.

Also, if it is expected the user to send funds, but the protocol to pay the fees, there is also an issue. This is because in that case the function checks only if the balance is enough, not if the `msg.value` is sufficient. This means the user can call the function with 0 `msg.value` and the transaction will proceed.

There is no documentation and it is hard to say what is the intended behavour of the protocol. For me the discord messages are not source of true, therefore I described the both scenarious.

## Impact

Lost fund for the users if they send `msg.value` when they call the `borrowCrossChain` function or lost funds for the protocol if they expect the caller to send funds, because there is no check if the `msg.value` is not 0.

## Mitigation

Remove the `payable` from the function if the users are not expecting to send funds or add a check to ensure that the `msg.value` is not 0, if it is expected they to send funds.
