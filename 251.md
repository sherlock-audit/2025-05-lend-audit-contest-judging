# Liquidator is incorrectly charged the seize amount instead of the repay amount in cross-chain liquidation flow

### Summary

In the cross-chain liquidation process, the protocol intentionally passes the seized amount (`seizeTokens`) as `payload.amount` to Chain A to calculate the liquidator’s reward share, protocol fee, and the collateral to seize from the borrower. However, later 
it incorrectly uses this seized amount as the repayment amount to be transferred by the liquidator, forgetting that it represents seized collateral tokens, not the actual repay amount of the borrower’s debt.

### Root Cause

The cross-chain liquidation logic passes the seized collateral amount (`seizeTokens`) as the amount parameter for repayment on chain B. Although this value is correctly used to calculate liquidator rewards and protocol fees on chain A, the code later treats the seized amount as the repay amount, causing the liquidator to be charged for the full seized amount instead of the actual repay amount. This mix-up arises because the protocol fails to differentiate between seize amount and repay amount during the cross-chain message handling and repayment process.

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L276) `seizeTokens` are inputted as `payload.amount`. It is correctly used in `_handleLiquidationExecute()`, but it inputs the same amount for the message as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L357). After that it calls `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()` with `payload.amount` (which right now is the seizedAmount) as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L467). It calls `_handleRepayment()` with `repayAmountFinal` (which will be the seizedAmount) as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L387). In the end it goes to `CoreRouter.sol#repayBorrowInternal()`  and charges liquidator with seizedAmount instead of repayAmount. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L483)

### Impact

Liquidators are forced to pay the seized collateral amount instead of the actual repay amount, causing them to overpay and incur unexpected losses. This economic imbalance discourages liquidators from participating, potentially leading to fewer liquidations and increased risk for the protocol.
