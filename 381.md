# H-02 Missing Deprecated Market Check Allows Borrowing from Deprecated Markets

### [H-02] Missing Deprecated Market Check Allows Borrowing from Deprecated Markets

**Description:** 
The `CoreRouter::borrow` does not check whether the target market `_lToken` is marked as deprecated in the controller `lendtroller`. The protocol provides a mechanism to deprecate markets via `LendtrollerInterfaceV2.isDeprecated(LToken)`, but this check is not enforced before allowing users to borrow.

**Impact:**  
- Users can continue to borrow from markets that have been deprecated by protocol governance or admins.
- Deprecated markets are typically deprecated for safety, risk, or migration reasons. Allowing new borrows undermines the purpose of deprecation and exposes the protocol and users to additional risk.
- Could lead to loss of funds or protocol instability if a deprecated market is exploited or fails.

**Proof of Concept:**

* `LendtrollerInterfaceV2.sol`
```solidity
 function isDeprecated(LToken cToken) external view virtual returns (bool);
```


* `CoreRouter.sol`
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
@> //missing the check
}
```


**Recommended Mitigation:**
```diff
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
+require(!LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(_lToken)), "Market is deprecated");
}
```
