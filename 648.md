# Incorrect borrow amount calculation leads false liquidations.

### Summary

In both the `borrow()` and `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` functions, the borrow indices are incorrectly applied to the `borrowed` amount returned by the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function, which is already denominated in USD.

The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function calculates the total borrow value by:
- Accruing interest on each borrow,
- Converting the resulting token amounts to USD using oracle prices,
- Summing them up.

Since this total is already in USD and includes all applicable interest, **applying the `borrowIndex` again (which is intended for raw principal amounts in token terms) is conceptually and mathematically incorrect**.

As a result, the total borrowed amount becomes inflated by the interest percentage again of user for that borrowToken, leading to:
- Borrow requests being rejected unfairly due to perceived over-borrowing,
- Healthy positions being incorrectly flagged as undercollateralized and prematurely liquidated.




### Root Cause

The value returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` represents the total borrow amount in USD (including interest). It is calculated using:
- Accrued interest on each borrow,
- Conversion of borrow token to USD using oracle prices.

Applying a token-specific `borrowIndex` to this total USD value is invalid, as it results in overestimation of the borrowed amount.

This happens in both borrow and liquidation logic:

```solidity
// From borrow()
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

// From liquidation
borrowedAmount =
    (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```

These are incorrect because `borrowed` already represents total debt in USD terms, and reapplying the index grossly inflates it.



### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user has an existing borrow position.
- Some time or borrow activity has caused interest accrual and borrow index increase.


### External Pre-conditions

None


### Attack Path

1. Alice has $1,000 worth of ETH as collateral.
2. She previously borrowed $600 USDC.
3. Over time, the borrow market accrues 50% interest.
4. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` returns $600 × 1.5 / 1.0 = $900 in USD as Alice’s total borrow.
5. In the `borrow()` and  `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` functions, this $900 is incorrectly inflated:
   ```solidity
   borrowAmount = (borrowed * borrowIndex) / userBorrowIndex;
   ```
   Assume borrowIndex is also 1.5×, this becomes:
   ```solidity
   borrowAmount = $900 × 1.5 / 1.0 = $1,350 (wrong!)
   ```
6. The protocol now believes Alice borrowed $1,350, exceeding her $1,000 collateral, and denies further borrowing or wrongly allows liquidation of her position.


### Impact

- Borrow attempts may fail even when collateral is sufficient.
- Healthy user positions may be liquidated, leading to loss of funds.


### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

- **Remove the application of `borrowIndex`** on values returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`.
- These values are already normalized to USD and include interest, they should be used as-is in both borrow and liquidation checks.

```solidity
// Borrow function
require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

// Liquidation check
require(borrowed > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```
