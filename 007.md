# Unlimited cross-chain borrow exploit through LayerZero message replay

### Summary

The `CrossChainRouter` contract processes `LayerZero BorrowCrossChain` messages without any replay protection. An attacker (or any honest relayer) can re-broadcast a previously sent borrow payload, causing the system to mint and transfer new tokens on the destination chain each time backed by the same collateral only once.

### Root Cause

There is no nonce, GUID, or “processed message” mapping recorded in the application layer. Every incoming `BorrowCrossChain` payload is treated as new and unconditionally triggers a fresh `CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain` call.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker must observe or capture a valid LayerZero `BorrowCrossChain` payload (e.g. from a public relayer log or by running a listening node).
- The destination chain’s `CrossChainRouter` must not implement any additional replay-protection guardrails.

### Attack Path

1. User on Chain A calls `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain(amount, token, destEid)`
- A LayerZero payload of type `BorrowCrossChain` is sent to Chain B.
- Chain B `CrossChainRouter._lzReceive` processes it and calls `CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain`, minting amount tokens to the borrower..
2. Attacker re-broadcasts the same payload (e.g. via any LayerZero relayer). Chain B `CrossChainRouter._lzReceive` again treats it as a new borrow request.
3. `CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain` is invoked again, minting another amount tokens to the borrower.
4. Each replay mints amount more tokens on Chain B, draining protocol reserves.

### Impact

Unlimited inflation of the borrowed asset on the destination chain. Attacker obtains unbacked tokens at zero cost.

### PoC
