# User can borrow in destination chains without enough collateral

### Summary

User requests borrow but request message doesn't contain source chain's `borrowed`, so user can borrow tokens without enough collateral.

### Root Cause

`CrossChainRouter`.`borrowCrossChain` sends only collateral amount using [`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L138-L139)
In destination chain, `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` compared collateral amount to destination chain's [`totalBorrowed`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617-L622)

This is borrowing using other chain's collateral so destination's `totalBorrowed` is not suitable for comparing.
The collateral amount that user sent  is total supply amount in source chain and some of this is for source chain's borrowing.
But user sent whole collateral amount and destination chain compared it to its borrowed amount.
Even though user borrows in source chain and rest of collateral is not enough, user can borrows again in other chains.

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. User supplies for collateral
2. User borrows as much as he can.
3. User borrows in other chain using `borrowCrossChain`
4. User borrows even though his collateral is not enough because he borrowed in source chain

### Impact

User can borrows in other chains using same collateral, so protocol can lose fund if user doesn't repay.
Liquidate can be fail because collateral is not  enough.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check that user can borrow in source chain.
