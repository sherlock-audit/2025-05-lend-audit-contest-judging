# lToken totalSupply can be manipulated due to empty market

### Summary

In the supply() of the CoreRouter contract, the exchangeRateStored() of the lToken is fetched before minting. If the totalSupply of the lToken is zero (i.e., no one has supplied to that market yet), the exchange rate becomes purely dependent on the lToken’s cash balance (underlying tokens held). 

An attacker can exploit this by artificially increasing the lToken’s cash (e.g., via direct transfers), making the exchange rate abnormally high. This results in receiving fewer lTokens for the supplied amount later enabling disproportionate borrowing and profit during redemption.

This is a well-documented vulnerability in forks of Compound when no safeguards exist for markets with zero supply.

### Root Cause

In the [supply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74C63-L74C81), exchangeRateBefore is gotten from the exchangeRateStored. In the [exchangeRateStored](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L281), it calls exchangeRateStoredInternal.

In the exchangeRateStoredInternal(), when totalSupply == 0, the exchangeRateStoredInternal() calculates the exchange rate based only on the cash (i.e., underlying balance) held by the lToken contract.

This makes the exchange rate manipulatable by directly sending tokens to the lToken contract.

The CoreRouter.supply() function uses the stale, manipulatable rate before calling mint(), meaning minted lTokens are calculated against a potentially inflated rate.

This manipulation may lead to borrowers extracting more value than is fair.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

This is similar to first deposit bug, which can lead to a direct theft of users' deposits due to the manipulation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When deploying or initializing a new lToken market, mint a small amount of tokens (e.g., to a protocol-owned address) to ensure totalSupply > 0. 

This prevents the exchange rate from being derived solely from the cash balance.
