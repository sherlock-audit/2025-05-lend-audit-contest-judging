### Title: Lendtroller::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal ignores price errors, breaks checks silently

Description:

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal(
    address account,
    LToken lTokenModify,
    uint256 redeemTokens,
    uint256 borrowAmount
) internal view returns (Error, uint256, uint256) {
    ...
    vars.oraclePriceMantissa = oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(asset);
    if (vars.oraclePriceMantissa == 0) {
        return (Error.PRICE_ERROR, 0, 0);
    }
    ...
}
```

The problem is that this function just returns (Error.PRICE_ERROR, 0, 0) when the oracle price is zero — no revert, no event, nothing. Other functions like redeemAllowed, borrowAllowed, and liquidateBorrowAllowed all depend on this, but they don’t always handle the PRICE_ERROR properly.

So the contract just keeps going with wrong assumptions.

Impact:

This causes hidden logic failures. A market might have zero price (due to oracle bug or stale feed), and the protocol would allow or reject things incorrectly. Could block borrowing or liquidations silently and confuse users. In the worst case, it may freeze parts of the system until the price is fixed.

PoC:

1. Oracle returns price = 0 for a token (either stale or failed update).


2. User tries to borrow or redeem using that token.


3. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal returns (PRICE_ERROR, 0, 0).


4. Caller like redeemAllowed() ignores the error value and just uses the 0 numbers.


5. Liquidity checks are skipped or miscalculated.


6. Borrow or redeem goes through or fails for the wrong reason.
