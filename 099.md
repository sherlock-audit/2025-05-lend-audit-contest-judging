# Incorrect token accounting in supply function due to stale exchange rate

### Summary

The `supply()` function in the CoreRouter contract incorrectly calculates the number of minted lTokens by using `exchangeRateStored()` instead of `exchangeRateCurrent()`. This leads to over-accounting of user investments when interest has accrued between the last rate update and the current transaction, creating a discrepancy between recorded balances and actual token holdings.


### Root Cause

[](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74-L80)

The root cause for the vulnerability is being `exchangeRateStored` used before calling `mint` function in the `supply()` function. And the `supply` function uses exchangeRate to calculate the actual minted tokens instead of using actual balance difference, which gives the actual lTokens minted

### Internal Pre-conditions

Assumes the interest accrues on the underlying asset, increasing in exxchange rate as time passes since the last interaction with lToken contract.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

User calls the `CoreRouter::supply` function, which uses exchangeRateStored which returns outdated rate. `mint` function in lToken internally uses current rate and mints fewer tokens, which protocols record more tokens than actually minted.

Attack Flow:
1. Assume, exchangeRateStored() = 1.05e18 (stale)
2. Now upon calling supply() in CoreRouter it mints(1000e18) tokens uses exchangeRateCurrent() = 1.06e18 internally
3. Actual minted tokens = (1000e18 * 1e18) / 1.06e18 = ~943e15
4. Calculated tokens = (1000e18 * 1e18) / 1.05e18 = ~952e15
5. Over-recording = 952e15 - 943e15 = ~9e15 tokens


### Impact

Users may be able to withdraw more than they actually supplied. And large cumulative discrepancies could lead to insufficient collateral backing. so leading to put the impact of the severity to HIGH

### Mitigation

```diff
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");

-       // Get exchange rate before mint
-       uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken)
-            .exchangeRateStored();

        // Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);

        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

        // Calculate actual minted tokens
+      uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken)
+            .exchangeRateStored();
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);

        // Update total investment using calculated mintTokens
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            msg.sender,
            _lToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
        );

        emit SupplySuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, _amount, mintTokens);
    }
