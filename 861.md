# Incorrect Underlying Token Transfer in CoreRouter::redeem

### Summary

The redeem function in the CoreRouter.sol contract calculates the amount of underlying tokens to return to the user based on the LToken's exchange rate before initiating the redeem operation on the LToken contract. The LToken's internal redeem logic, however, first accrues interest, which can change the exchange rate, and then transfers the underlying tokens based on this updated rate. This discrepancy between the amount calculated by CoreRouter and the amount actually transferred by the LToken leads to incorrect underlying token transfers to the user, potentially causing transaction reverts or trapping funds in the CoreRouter contract.

## Vulnerability Description:

When a user calls `CoreRouter::redeem` to redeem their LTokens for the underlying asset, the function performs the following steps:

It fetches the LToken's exchange rate using `LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored()`.
It calculates the `expectedUnderlying` amount based on the user's requested `_amount` of `LTokens` and the fetched `exchangeRateBefore`.
It calls `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)` on the `LToken` contract.
It transfers the previously calculated expectedUnderlying amount of the underlying token from the CoreRouter contract to the user `(msg.sender)`.

The vulnerability lies in the timing of the exchange rate calculation. The exchangeRateStored() function in the LToken contract returns the exchange rate based on the market's state at the time of the last interest accrual. The `LToken::redeem()` function (which calls `redeemInternal` and subsequently `redeemFresh`), however, first calls `accrueInterest()` to update the market state and exchange rate before calculating the amount of underlying tokens to transfer out.

This means the exchangeRateBefore used by CoreRouter might be stale. The LToken contract calculates the actual amount of underlying to transfer to CoreRouter based on the fresh exchange rate after interest accrual.

If the exchange rate increases during the accrueInterest() call within the LToken, the LToken will transfer more underlying tokens to CoreRouter than expectedUnderlying. CoreRouter will then transfer only expectedUnderlying to the user, leaving the surplus underlying tokens trapped in the CoreRouter contract.
If the exchange rate decreases, the LToken will transfer less underlying tokens to CoreRouter than expectedUnderlying. CoreRouter will then attempt to transfer expectedUnderlying to the user, which will likely revert due to insufficient balance in the CoreRouter contract.
Furthermore, if the underlying token is a fee-on-transfer token, the amount received by CoreRouter from the LToken will be even less than the amount the LToken intended to send (due to the transfer fee). The CoreRouter's calculation of expectedUnderlying does not account for this fee, exacerbating the discrepancy and increasing the likelihood of reverts or incorrect transfers.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the reliance on a potentially stale exchange rate fetched before the LToken's internal interest accrual and transfer logic executes. The CoreRouter calculates the expected outcome based on old data and then attempts to fulfill that expectation, rather than measuring the actual outcome of the LToken's operation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Impact:

1. If the exchange rate decreases or the underlying token has a transfer fee, the CoreRouter may attempt to transfer more underlying tokens than it received from the LToken, causing the IERC20(_token).transfer call to revert.

2. If the exchange rate increases, the CoreRouter receives more underlying tokens than it transfers to the user, leaving excess funds permanently locked in the CoreRouter contract.

3. While lendStorage.totalInvestment is updated by subtracting the redeemed LToken amount (_amount), the user receives an incorrect amount of underlying tokens, leading to a mismatch between the user's perceived value and the actual tokens received.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this, the `CoreRouter` should determine the actual amount of underlying tokens received from the LToken after the `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)` call completes. This can be done by checking the CoreRouter's underlying token balance before and after the redeem call, similar to the fix proposed for the supply function. The `CoreRouter` should then transfer this actual received amount to the user. This approach correctly accounts for both exchange rate fluctuations within the LToken and potential transfer fees on the underlying token. The `user's totalInvestment` should still be reduced by the `_amount` of `LTokens` redeemed, as this reflects the reduction in their LToken holdings.
