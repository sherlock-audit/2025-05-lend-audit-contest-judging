# Liquidators will trigger premature liquidations for borrowers

### Summary

The protocol's liquidation validation mechanism suffers from a double interest calculation vulnerability. When validating liquidations, the protocol takes an already interest-adjusted amount from `borrowWithInterestSame` and applies the same interest calculation again in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`. This double compounding artificially inflates the borrower's debt, allowing liquidators to trigger liquidations on positions that should still be healthy, resulting in unfair liquidations and potential protocol insolvency.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol`, the [`liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L329) function applies interest calculation on an already interest-adjusted amount. The function receives the `borrowed` parameter from `borrowWithInterestSame` which already includes interest calculation, but then applies the same interest calculation again using `borrowBalance.borrowIndex`.

The `borrowed` parameter passed to `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is already interest-adjusted from `borrowWithInterestSame`, but the function applies the same interest calculation again, leading to double compounding of interest.

```solidity
// liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function applies interest calculation on an already interest-adjusted amount
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower needs to have an active loan position
2. Borrower's position needs to be close to but not yet at liquidation threshold
3. Liquidator needs to have sufficient collateral to perform liquidation

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market conditions need to be such that the borrower's position is near but not at liquidation threshold
2. Price of borrowed asset needs to be stable enough that double interest calculation would push position into liquidation

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator monitors positions that are near but not at liquidation threshold
2. Liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow` function
3. `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is called with already interest-adjusted amount
4. Function applies interest calculation again, artificially inflating the debt
5. Inflated debt amount passes the `borrowedAmount > collateral` check
6. Position is liquidated prematurely

### Impact

The borrowers suffer premature liquidation of their positions. The liquidators gain from liquidating positions that should still be healthy, potentially extracting more value than they should be entitled to. This could lead to significant losses for borrowers and protocol insolvency if liquidations are triggered too early.

### PoC

```solidity
// Initial conditions
borrower.principal = 1000
currentIndex = 1.1
userIndex = 1.0

// First interest calculation in 'borrowWithInterestSame'
borrowed = 1000 * 1.1 / 1.0 = 1100

// Second interest calculation in 'liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal'
borrowedAmount = 1100 * 1.1 / 1.0 = 1210

// Position that should have 1100 debt now appears to have 1210 debt
// This could trigger liquidation when it shouldn't
```

### Mitigation

Remove the second interest calculation in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` since the `borrowed` parameter is already interest-adjusted. Use the raw principal amount from `borrowBalance.amount` instead of the already-interest-adjusted `borrowed` parameter.
