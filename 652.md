# Redemption Logic Uses Stale Exchange Rate, Causing Under-Crediting of Users

### Summary

The redeem() function calculates the expected value of redeemed tokens using an outdated exchange rate, resulting in discrepancies between the recorded and actual token amounts. This leads to under-crediting users and inconsistency in the protocolâ€™s internal accounting.

### Root Cause

The function computes expectedUnderlying using an outdated exchange rate obtained before calling redeem() on the interest-bearing token. Since redeem() triggers an interest accrual internally, the actual exchange rate used during redemption is higher than the one used for calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

- The contract fetches the exchange rate (e.g., exchangeRateStored()) before interest has accrued.

- expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18 is calculated using this stale rate.

- The next line calls LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount), which internally accrues interest.

- Due to this accrual, the actual underlying tokens received are higher than expectedUnderlying.

- The system proceeds with internal updates (user balances, events, rewards) using the underestimated value.

### Impact

Users may be credited with fewer tokens than they actually received.

System state may reflect incorrect redemption amounts, leading to accounting inconsistencies.

Repeated occurrences can skew supply metrics and introduce drift between recorded and actual state.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that interest is accrued before using the exchange rate in calculations.
