# Incorrect Conditional Logic in borrowWithInterest Prevents Cross-Chain Debt Repayment

### Summary

In the borrowWithInterest function, the conditional check for calculating interest-bearing debt from crossChainCollaterals mistakenly enforces that both srcEid and destEid must match the current chain’s currentEid. However, for cross-chain borrows, this condition never holds true (since source and destination are by design different), which results in borrowedAmount being calculated as zero, thereby blocking debt repayment.

### Root Cause

When user borrow tokens on another destiantion chain crossChainCollaterals is updated to track user dept. But when calculating user cross chain dep, the if condition is logically incorrect for cross-chain borrows. Destination and source cant be equal to current eid.

```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
...
        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];
...
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
        return borrowedAmount;
    }
```

As a result cross chain debt can't be repaid since borrow amount would be 0.
```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

A user borrows 100 tokens cross-chain → addCrossChainCollateral() stores a borrow with srcEid != destEid.
When repaying on the destination chain:
      borrowWithInterest() checks srcEid == destEid == currentEid, which is false.

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

Cross-chain borrow repayments on the destination chain always fail 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the condition in borrowWithInterest to correctly identify relevant borrow records:

```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid) {
    borrowedAmount +=
        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
}
```
