# A user can supply collateral via flashloan/flashmint, initiate a cross-chain borrow, and redeem collateral in a single transaction to drain protocol funds.

### Summary

The protocol allows a user to supply collateral (even via a flashloan or flashmint), immediately initiate a cross-chain borrow, and redeem the collateral in the same transaction. Due to asynchronous cross-chain state updates, the user receives borrowed tokens on the destination chain without ever having real collateral at risk, leading to protocol insolvency.

### Root Cause

When a user supplies collateral and calls `borrowCrossChain`, the protocol does not lock or reserve the collateral before the cross-chain borrow is finalized. The state update on the source chain (collateral chain) only occurs after the cross-chain message round-trip is complete. This allows the user to `redeem  `their collateral immediately after initiating the cross-chain borrow, even within the same transaction (e.g., using a flashloan or flashmint(with Dai)). The destination chain processes the borrow request, believing the collateral is still locked, and sends the borrowed tokens to the user. The protocol on the source chain only realizes the collateral was redeemed after the fact, resulting in an uncollateralized loan and draining protocol funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

State updates on the source chain occur only after the cross-chain borrow is finalized.

### External Pre-conditions

The user can obtain a flashloan or flashmint of a supported collateral token.

### Attack Path

1. User obtains a flashloan or flashmints a supported collateral token on Chain A.
2. User supplies the token as collateral to the protocol on Chain A.
3. User immediately calls borrowCrossChain to borrow on Chain B.
4. User redeems their supplied collateral on Chain A in the same transaction.
5. User repays the flashloan or flashmint on Chain A.
6. The cross-chain borrow is processed asynchronously, and the user receives the borrowed tokens on Chain B without ever having real collateral at risk(attack cost involving gas cost and maybe dust collateral loss when redeeming due to rounding).

### Impact

Users can receive borrowed tokens on the destination chain without ever having real collateral at risk. The protocol is left with uncollateralized or under-collateralized loans, resulting in loss of funds and potential insolvency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require that collateral cannot be redeemed for some time.
