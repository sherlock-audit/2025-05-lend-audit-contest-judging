# CrossChainRouter will lose user's borrowed funds due to silent transfer failures with non-standard tokens like USDT

### Summary

The CoreRouter contract uses an unsafe `transfer()` method instead of `safeTransfer()` in the borrowForCrossChain function. When interacting with non-standard ERC20 implementations like USDT that return false on failure instead of reverting, this can cause borrowed funds to remain stuck in the contract while the protocol's accounting still records the loan as disbursed. This creates a mismatch between the protocol's recorded liabilities and actual asset positions, potentially leading to unfair liquidations and financial losses.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in the borrowForCrossChain function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L195-L205

```solidity
function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
    external
{
    require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");
    require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
    
    require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
    IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount); // Vulnerable line
}
```
The issue is that the function doesn't check the return value of transfer(). While many ERC20 tokens revert on failed transfers, some notable exceptions like USDT simply return false. This means a USDT transfer might fail silently, with the function appearing to complete successfully while funds remain in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The CrossChainRouter needs to be set in the CoreRouter contract (setCrossChainRouter)

The CoreRouter must contain the tokens that are being borrowed (i.e., have sufficient funds)

The borrowForCrossChain function must successfully complete the borrow operation but encounter a failure in the transfer operation

### External Pre-conditions

- The underlying token must be a non-standard ERC20 implementation that returns false on transfer failure rather than reverting (e.g., USDT)

- The transfer must fail for some reason, such as:

    Sending to a blacklisted address (USDT has a blacklist feature)
    Contract upgrades or pauses in the token contract
    Reaching a balance limit or other transfer restriction


### Attack Path

1. Setup: An attacker monitors the protocol for cross-chain borrow transactions involving USDT
2. Preparation:
    The attacker uses social engineering or other methods to get a target user's address blacklisted by Tether
3. Execution:
  The target user initiates a cross-chain borrow request for USDT
  The CrossChainRouter calls borrowForCrossChain on the destination chain
  The borrow function succeeds, removing tokens from the lending pool
  But the transfer to the user fails silently because of the blacklisting or other USDT restriction

4. Exploitation:
  The protocol now believes the user has borrowed USDT and begins accruing interest
  The user doesn't receive funds but is still liable for repayment
  The funds remain stuck in the CoreRouter contract

### Impact

- Users could lose millions in interest payments on loans they never received
- Protocol could experience significant fund lockup 
- A user might supply $100K in ETH as collateral, attempt to borrow $70K USDT that they never receive, and still face liquidation if ETH price drops
- If 5-10% of cross-chain USDT borrows fail silently over time, the protocol would develop a significant liability-asset mismatch

### Mitigation

Replace the unsafe `transfer()` with `safeTransfer()`

```solidity
// Add this at the top of the contract
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

// Then replace the vulnerable line with:
IERC20(destUnderlying).safeTransfer(_borrower, _amount);
```
