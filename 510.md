# Unvalidated Destination Chain ID in Cross-Chain Borrowing Function Allows Economic Griefing and Fund Loss

### Summary
The [`borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L117) function allows users to initiate a cross-chain borrow operation without validating the user-provided destination endpoint ID (_destEid). This enables both malicious and legitimate users to unintentionally send messages to unsupported or invalid chains. Since the protocol uses its own balance to pay LayerZero messaging fees, this results in a direct economic loss for the protocol per invalid message.

### Root cause
Although the protocol documentation lists the chains planned for support, the contract does not enforce this in code. There is no allowlist or validation mechanism to ensure that the provided `_destEid` corresponds to a supported destination chain before sending a LayerZero message.

### Attack Path
1. A user (malicious or legitimate) calls `borrowCrossChain()` with a valid token and borrow amount, but an invalid or unsupported `_destEid`.

2. The contract proceeds to call `_send()` without verifying the destination chain.

3. `_send()` constructs the message and uses `address(this).balance` to pay the LayerZero messaging fee.

4. The message is sent to an invalid or unmonitored destination, resulting in wasted protocol funds / personal funds.

5. Repeating this action drains the protocolâ€™s balance through messaging fees, and a personal loss for users paying for their own transactions.

### Impact
- Direct economic loss for the protocol per message sent to an invalid or unsupported destination chain.

- Operational inefficiency as even legitimate users might unknowingly cause fund loss by entering an incorrect destination chain ID.

### Recommendation
Implement an on-chain allowlist of supported destination chains and add a validation check in `borrowCrossChain()` to reject any `_destEid` not included in this on-chain allowlist, ensuring consistency between documentation and contract behavior.
