# Over-Seizure of Collateral During Liquidation

### Summary

The `liquidateBorrow` function, in its current implementation, can lead to an over-seizure of collateral from a borrower. This occurs because the `repayAmount` provided by the liquidator is used to both reduce the borrower's debt and subsequently calculate the amount of collateral to seize. Due to the sequential execution, the collateral seizure calculation in `liquidateSeizeUpdate` is based on the initial `repayAmount` supplied by the liquidator, even though the borrower's debt has already been reduced by that amount via `repayBorrowInternal`. This can result in more collateral being seized than is necessary to cover the actual remaining shortfall after the repayment.

### Affected Code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L212
## Root Cause

The `repayAmount` parameter is used twice in the liquidation process within `liquidateBorrowInternal`:

1.  It is first used to reduce the borrower's debt via a call to `repayBorrowInternal`.
2.  It is then passed directly to `liquidateSeizeUpdate` to calculate `seizeTokens`.

The `liquidateSeizeUpdate` function's `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` call does not account for the fact that the borrower's debt has already been reduced by the `repayAmount` (or a portion of it, capped by `maxClose`) in the preceding `repayBorrowInternal` call. This leads to the calculation of seized collateral being based on a debt reduction that has already occurred, potentially resulting in seizing more collateral than is necessary for the remaining shortfall.

## Internal Pre-conditions

* A borrower has an outstanding loan and is in a shortfall (undercollateralized) state.
* The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function permits the liquidation (i.e., `borrowedAmount > collateral` and `repayAmount <= maxClose`).
* The `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` function calculates seized tokens based on the `repayAmount` provided.

## External Pre-conditions

* A liquidator initiates a liquidation transaction with a `repayAmount` that is greater than the actual shortfall, but still within the `maxClose` limit.

## Attack Path

1.  **Initial State:** Alice has a loan of 1000 USDC and collateral worth 950 USDC. She is in a shortfall of 50 USDC.
2.  **Liquidator Action:** Bob (the liquidator) sees Alice's position and decides to repay 200 USDC (which is allowed if the protocol's `maxClose` factor permits repaying up to 200 USDC).
3.  **`liquidateBorrow` Call:** Bob calls `liquidateBorrow(Alice, 200, lTokenCollateral, borrowedAsset)`.
4.  **`liquidateBorrowInternal` Execution:**
    * `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is called:
        * It confirms Alice is in shortfall (1000 > 950).
        * It confirms `repayAmount` (200) is less than or equal to `maxClose`. The check passes.
    * `repayBorrowInternal(Alice, Bob, 200, borrowedlToken, true)` executes:
        * Alice's USDC debt is reduced by 200. Her new debt is 800 USDC.
        * Alice's account is now healthy (800 debt, 950 collateral).
    * `liquidateSeizeUpdate(msg.sender, Alice, lTokenCollateral, borrowedlToken, 200)` is called:
        * `LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(..., 200)` is invoked. This function calculates the amount of collateral to seize based on the `repayAmount` of 200 USDC.
        * The protocol proceeds to seize collateral corresponding to 200 USDC, even though only 50 USDC was needed to cover the original shortfall, and the account is now healthy.

## Impact

This vulnerability leads to the over-seizure of collateral from the borrower and the liquidator gains an unfair amount of collateral, effectively profiting from an over-liquidation.

## PoC


## Mitigation

The `liquidateSeizeUpdate` function should calculate `seizeTokens` based on the *actual shortfall amount* that was resolved by the `repayAmount`, rather than using the full `repayAmount` directly if it exceeds the shortfall
