# Borrower will have assigned a new debt, he partially tries to repay his cross-chain borrows

### Summary

Borrower will have assigned a new debt, he partially tries to repay his cross-chain borrows

### Root Cause

When a borrower cross-chain borrows he gets a cross-chain borrow ["account"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L716-L723) where his data is stored and tracked, next if he decides to partially repay his debt, he must do it by the `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` function. If we follow the call flow, the `repayCrossChainLiquidation` will be invoked next, which calls the [`repayBorrowInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459). The problem is that on partial repayment:

```javascript
 function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        ...

        uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

        // Transfer tokens from the liquidator to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);

        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

        // Repay borrowed tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");

        // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
@>>>        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }
```

His regular `borrowBalance` "account" is updated, which is basically non-existent, because the `LendStorage::borrowBalance` is assigned only on regular [borrows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L175-L183) not cross-chain ones. Thus the borrower will have new debt opened on the chain that he initially borrowed (the dest. chain) 

Important to note here that [`updateBorrowBalance` only assigns values](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L241-L247) which is also problematic

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower must initiate a cross-chain borrow
2. He decides to repay partially.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`High`, borrower will have assigned new, if he decides to partially repay, which also means if he tries to supply on the dest. chain he will not be able to redeem or worse he can get liquidated and get his collateral seized
