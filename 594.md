# Collateral Check Bypass via USD vs Token Units Mismatch

### Summary

In the `CoreRouter.borrow()` function, the protocol performs a collateral sufficiency check using a flawed unit conversion. It compares a value in tokens against collateral denominated in USD. This error allows users to bypass collateral checks entirely and borrow without limit.


### Root Cause


The protocol mixes units between USD and underlying token amounts:

The function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` returns both `borrowed` and `collateral` in **USD units**, the code mistakenly scales the borrowed USD amount using the token's borrowIndex, which is a time-based interest scalerâ€”not a USD-to-token converter, It then compares that token-denominated value against `collateral`, which remains in USD.

The comparison of collateral (USD) against borrowAmount (tokens) is invalid and always passes under normal conditions.

```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

```

### Internal Pre-conditions


- The system uses Compound-style interest accrual with a borrowIndex.
- Borrow balances are tracked via principal + index snapshots.


### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker has a small amount of any acceptable collateral token.

### Attack Path


1. The attacker deposits a minimal amount of collateral.
2. Calls `borrow(_amount, _token)` with a very large `_amount`.
3. Applies interest index math to convert borrowed to a fake borrowAmount (wrong units).
4. The flawed comparison of USD collateral vs token-denominated borrowed amount always passes.
5. The attacker receives a large `_amount` of tokens without sufficient backing collateral.


### Impact


An attacker can drain all available liquidity of any market by repeatedly borrowing without being checked against their collateral, leading to total loss of funds for the protocol and its users.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Fix the units in the collateral check:

* Do **not** convert `borrowed` into token amounts using index math.
* Directly compare USD values:

```solidity
(uint256 usdBorrowed, uint256 usdCollateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...);

require(usdCollateral >= usdBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
