# Borrow function misapplies single market borrow factor to multi market borrowed value

### Summary

When users call `CoreRouter::borrow` to borrow tokens, In an attempt to check if the user is collateralized enough for the loan, there is a call to `lendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. This call is expected to return the sum of the user's collateral across all deposited tokens, and the sum of all borrowed amount across all borrowed tokens(including the new loan to be processed).  The borrow function errorneously scales the entire `borrowed` amount using the borrowIndex of just `_lToken` (from which the current loan is being processed), which makes no sense if the user has multiple borrowed assets, each with different indices.

```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
        //@audit this borrowed here cuts across all tokens that have been previously borrowed
        //@audit this will include all cross chain borrows
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);
        //@audit borrowAmount is scaling the entire borrowed amount by the borrow index of one specific market
        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
@>>         ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

@>>     require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

        // Enter the Compound market
        //@audit here we are entering the market multiple times
        enterMarkets(_lToken);

        // Borrow tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
```

### Root Cause

Wrong scaling of the user borrowed amount

### Internal Pre-conditions

* User has multiple borrowed assets

### External Pre-conditions

* User attempts to borrow more of an asset he has previously borrowed

### Attack Path

* User has borrowed a cummulative amount of $100K ($10k WBTC, $90k other tokens)
* User's collateral, after adjusting for collateral factor, is $120k
* User attempts a new loan of $5k (WBTC)
* Code errorneously scales an entire amount of $105k, using the borrow index of  (WBTC) up to 130k.
* User appears undercollateralalized ($120k < 130k)

### Impact

User will appear undecollateralized, even when they have sufficient collateral

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Eradicate this entire code block below, as it is not needed. 

```solidity
        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
```

The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` does the scaling efficiently, before returning the cummulative borrowed amount
