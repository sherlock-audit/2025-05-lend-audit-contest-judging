# Broken Logic In borrowWithInterest could lead to wrong repayBorrow Interest accounting

### Summary

In the `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()` we are using a check i.e

[Here is the snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478)

```solidity
      } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.

                //@audit 
                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
        return borrowedAmount;
    }
```

We are checking that if the both the destinationID and the sourceID is equal to the currentEID of the chain which is not possible in a cross-chain borrow.


Let's take a closer look at the `Borrow[]` struct 

```solidity
    struct Borrow {
        uint256 srcEid; // Source chain's layer zero endpoint id
        uint256 destEid; // Destination chain's layer zero endpoint id
        uint256 principle; // Borrowed token amount
        uint256 borrowIndex; // Borrow index
        address borrowedlToken; // Address of the borrower
        address srcToken; // Source token address
    }
```

it clearly states that srcEid is the sourceChain's layerZero endpoint id and the destId is the layer zero's destionation endId where the message will be received/

The condition must be `if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid  || collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)`.

borrowWithInterest is an integral part of the borrow flow (and is used in `repayBorrowInternal` of the cross-chain borrow functionality of the protocol.)

It could lead to wrong values being passed on in case of a cross-chain borrow and could lead to wrong interest calculation in the repay functionality of the protocol.



### Root Cause

- Wrong conditional operator implementation.
- Wrong assumption that in a cross-chain borrow/repay that the sourceEid and the destinationEid can be same.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- No attack path, it's an logical error.

### Impact

- Wrong interest calculation when a repayer/liquidator tries to repay the borrowed amount.
-  Function is used in the crossChainBorrow flow and the liquidation repay flow in the `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` function which could lead to wrong Interest calc and loss for protocol.

### PoC

### Mitigation

```solidity

 function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) { //q We are assigning a uint32 to a uint256
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.


--                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) 
++               if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid || collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
{
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
