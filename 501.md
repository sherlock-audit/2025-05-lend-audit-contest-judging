# Potential DoS in `repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `liquidateCrossChain()`

### Summary
The protocol’s cross-chain messaging fee model relies on the contract’s Ether balance to fund LayerZero message dispatches. The `borrowCrossChain()` function is marked payable, but the fee responsibility is not enforced per caller — nor is it clearly documented whether the protocol or users are intended to fund the messaging fees. 

A malicious user can iteratively call `borrowCrossChain()` with negligible Ether amounts, progressively depleting the contract’s balance used for LayerZero message fees. Once the balance is exhausted, other essential cross-chain operations such as `repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `liquidateCrossChain()` — which are not `payable` and also rely on the contract’s balance — would be unable to dispatch messages, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

### Root cause
The `_send()` function uses [`address(this).balance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) to pay for LayerZero messaging fees for all cross-chain operations, but there’s no enforced mechanism for individual callers to cover their own messaging costs.

Although `borrowCrossChain()` is payable and user can pay for their own transactions, it allows calls with very little Ether without verifying sufficiency for the resulting message fee. The fee model design assumes the contract itself maintains enough Ether — but there’s no explicit documentation or guarantees about who replenishes this balance. While the protocol may supply funds as needed, this funding model can be exploited by malicious actors calling `borrowCrossChain()` repeatedly, draining the contract faster than it can be replenished.
```javascript
//CrossChainRouter::_send()
  _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
```

### Attack Path
1. A malicious user repeatedly calls `borrowCrossChain()` with minimal Ether (e.g., 1 wei) per call.

2. Each call passes the `require(address(this).balance > 0)` check and attempts a LayerZero message dispatch using the contract’s total balance for the messaging fee.
```javascript
    function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
        require(msg.sender != address(0), "Invalid sender");
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");
  @>    require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");
    .. 
    }
```

3. As each transaction uses whatever balance is available, the cumulative effect progressively drains the contract’s Ether balance.

4. Other vital protocol functions like `repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `liquidateCrossChain()` (which are not payable) rely on the same balance to dispatch LayerZero messages via `_send()`.
```javascript
 function repayCrossChainBorrow(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _lToken, uint32 _srcEid) external {
    ...
 }
```
```javascript
function liquidateCrossChain(
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint32 srcEid,
        address lTokenToSeize,
        address borrowedAsset
    ) external {
        ... }
```
6. Once the balance is depleted, these operations become non-functional until the protocol manually replenishes the contract’s balance.

7. The exploit can be repeated at little to no cost to the attacker, creating a sustainable denial-of-service condition against critical protocol functionality.


### Impact
Denial-of-service (DoS) against essential cross-chain operations, including repayments and liquidations.

Protocol solvency risks if liquidation operations are blocked on unhealthy positions.


### Recommendation
-  Require `borrowCrossChain()` , `repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `liquidateCrossChain()` callers to supply sufficient `msg.value` for their own LayerZero messaging fee, refactor `_send()` to use `msg.value` instead of `address(this).balance,` .
- Add `payable` modifier to `repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `liquidateCrossChain()`.
