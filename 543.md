# Incorrect Token/Amount in Cross-Chain Liquidation Repayment

## Summary
In the CrossChainRouter contract, the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function incorrectly uses the collateral token and amount from Chain A to repay debt on Chain B, which will cause the borrower's debt not to be properly reduced after a cross-chain liquidation, while liquidators still receive the correct collateral amount.

## Root Cause
In the [repayCrossChainBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L464-L470) function is called with incorrect parameters:

```solidity
repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
    payload.sender, // The borrower
    payload.liquidator, // The liquidator (repayer)
    payload.amount, // Amount to repay - THIS IS WRONG
    payload.destlToken, // lToken representing the borrowed asset on this chain
    srcEid // The chain where the collateral (and borrow reference) is tracked
);
```

The `payload.amount` here represents the amount of collateral tokens seized on Chain A, but the function should use the original repay amount in the borrowed asset from Chain B. This causes the repayment to use the wrong token and amount.

## Internal pre-conditions
1. A user must have a cross-chain borrow position (collateral on Chain A, debt on Chain B)
2. The user's position must become eligible for liquidation (health factor < 1)
3. A liquidator must execute a cross-chain liquidation via liquidateCrossChain

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User supplies collateral on Chain A and borrows on Chain B
2. User's position becomes eligible for liquidation (health factor < 1)
3. Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain on Chain B with a valid repay amount
4. The protocol executes the liquidation successfully, seizing collateral on Chain A
5. When handling the success message on Chain B, the protocol incorrectly uses the collateral token amount instead of the original repay amount
6. This results in either an incorrect debt reduction or a transaction failure
7. Liquidator receives correct collateral but borrower's debt is not properly reduced

## Impact
This bug creates a severe accounting mismatch in the protocol. The liquidator receives the correct amount of collateral tokens from Chain A, but the borrower's debt position on Chain B is not properly reduced. This leads to:  

1. Borrowers having higher debt than they should after liquidation
2. Protocol accounting becoming inconsistent
3. Potential for multiple liquidations of the same position
4. Loss of user funds due to excess debt interest accrual

## Mitigation
Modify the _handleLiquidationSuccess function to use the original repay amount from the liquidation request rather than the collateral amount
