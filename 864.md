# Incorrect liquidity check on destination chain.

### Summary

During cross-chain borrows, the destination chain is expected to verify that the `payload.collateral` provided by the source chain covers **only** the cross-chain borrow amount being originated from that source chain. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks that the `payload.collateral` covers all of the userâ€™s **same-chain borrows of destination chain and cross-chain borrows originated from the destination chain**, which is invalid logic.


```solidity
(uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    payload.sender,
    LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)),
    0,
    payload.amount
);

require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L616-L622

This causes the borrow requests to fail even if the user has sufficient collateral on the **source** chain to support the **new** cross-chain borrow.

### Root Cause

The destination chain incorrectly validates the borrow by checking whether `payload.collateral` can cover:

- Same-chain borrows on the destination chain  
- Cross-chain borrows originated **from** the destination chain  

This is incorrect because the collateral being validated (`payload.collateral`) resides on the **source** chain, not the destination chain. It should only be checked against the cross-chain borrows taken from the source chain.

### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions



### Impact

Valid cross-chain borrow requests are incorrectly rejected.  



### PoC

_No response provided._

### Mitigation

Update the destination chain logic to validate only that the `payload.collateral` covers the borrow being initiated from the source chain and previous borrows from source chain. Avoid  including:

- Same-chain borrows on the destination chain  
- Other cross-chain borrows **originating** from the destination chain
