# Incorrect Mint Token Calculation in `supply` Function

## Finding description and impact

The `supply` function incorrectly calculates the number of minted lTokens by relying on the exchange rate **before** minting rather than measuring the actual token balance change.

```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
...
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61-L92

### Root cause

The function assumes a static exchange rate and uses it to approximate the number of minted tokens. This fails to capture:

* Rounding behavior in the `mint` function
* Exchange rate changes due to other concurrent interactions
* Fees, if any, in the minting logic

### Impact

* Overestimation or underestimation of `mintTokens`
* Incorrect accounting in `totalInvestment`
* Potential inconsistencies in downstream logic using `mintTokens`
* Users may get more or fewer rewards or face inaccurate risk calculations

## mitigation

Replace the estimated calculation with an actual balance delta check:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this));
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 mintTokens = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```

This approach directly reflects the actual number of lTokens minted and avoids reliance on outdated or fluctuating exchange rates.
