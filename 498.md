# Stale collateral data risk in cross-chain borrow execution may lead to undercollateralized loans

### Summary

When a cross-chain borrow is initiated, the collateral value is determined on the source chain (Chain A) and included in the message sent to the destination chain (Chain B). Due to inherent LayerZero messaging delays (including source chain finality and relay latency), this collateral value can become stale. If the actual collateral value on Chain A decreases significantly by the time Chain B processes the borrow request, Chain B may approve a loan based on the outdated, higher collateral value, leading to the issuance of an undercollateralized loan.

### Root Cause

On CrossChainRouter.sol, the [`borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) function on the source chain (Chain A) calculates the user's `collateral` value at that point in time and includes this value in the `LZPayload` sent to the destination chain (Chain B).
Then, the [`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L581) function on Chain B receives the `payload.collateral` value (which is the collateral value from Chain A at the time the message was sent) and uses it directly in its crucial safety check: [`require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L622).

```solidity
    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        ________snip______
        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );

        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral"); // @audit chain A collateral value is used without sanity check
        ________snip______
    }
```

This check does not re-verify or account for any potential decrease in the collateral's actual market value on Chain A that might have occurred during the LayerZero message transmission delay.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-   A user initiates a [`borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) transaction on a source chain (Chain A).
-   The [`LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385) function on Chain A calculates and provides a specific collateral value based on current oracle prices for the user's assets on Chain A.

### External Pre-conditions

-   A non-zero delay exists in LayerZero message transmission from Chain A to Chain B. This delay encompasses source chain block finality, relayer network activity, and destination chain block inclusion time.
-   The market price of the user's collateral asset(s) on Chain A decreases during this message transmission delay. (While oracles are trusted to be correct at any point in time, the data used by Chain B is from a *past* point in time from Chain A).

### Attack Path

This describes a scenario leading to the issue, not necessarily a direct attack by a malicious user other than one exploiting market volatility and system latency:
1.  A user on Chain A has collateral valued at $1000 by trusted oracles on Chain A at time T0.
2.  The user initiates `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` on Chain A, requesting to borrow an amount (e.g., $700 worth of assets) on Chain B. The LayerZero message payload sent from Chain A includes `collateral = 1000_USD_value`.
3.  The LayerZero message is relayed to Chain B. This process (T_delay) takes several minutes (inclusive of finality, relaying, and destination chain block time).
4.  During T_delay, the market price of the user's collateral on Chain A drops significantly. At time T1 (when the message is processed on Chain B), the user's collateral on Chain A is now actually worth only $750 according to the current trusted oracle price on Chain A.
5.  The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` function on Chain B executes. It uses the `payload.collateral = 1000` (the stale value from T0).
6.  It calculates `totalBorrowed` for the $700 request. The check `require(1000 >= 700)` passes.
7.  The borrow of $700 is approved and executed on Chain B.
8.  **Outcome:** The protocol has issued a $700 loan on Chain B, while the actual current value of the collateral backing it on Chain A is only $750. If the Loan-To-Value (LTV) limit was, for instance, 75%, this loan ($700 debt against $750 collateral = 93% LTV) is immediately undercollateralized or has significantly less buffer than intended.

### Impact

- The protocol may issue loans that are undercollateralized from their inception (or very close to liquidation thresholds) due to relying on stale collateral valuations from the source chain. This increases the risk of bad debt if the collateral value continues to fall before liquidation can occur.
- The intended safety margins provided by collateralization ratios are eroded by using stale data.
- The lending pool on the destination chain that supplies the borrowed assets bears the immediate risk of any resulting bad debt.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement significantly more conservative Loan-To-Value ratios (LTVs) for all cross-chain borrow operations compared to same-chain operations. This acts as a buffer against price volatility during message transit.
1.  **Message Staleness Check:**
    * Include the source chain block number or timestamp (Chain A's `block.timestamp`) in the `LZPayload`.
    * In `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` on Chain B, check if the age of the message (`block.timestamp (Chain B) - payload.timestamp (Chain A)`) exceeds a predefined, short validity window (e.g., a few minutes, configurable per path). If too stale, reject the borrow request. This requires some tolerance for inter-chain clock drift.
2.  **Apply a "Staleness Factor" to Received Collateral Value:** When using `payload.collateral` on Chain B, apply a discount factor based on the message age or a fixed percentage to account for potential price drops during transit before checking against `totalBorrowed`.
    ```solidity
    // Example in _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest on Chain B
    // uint256 stalenessBufferBps = 500; // 5% buffer, configurable
    // uint256 discountedCollateral = payload.collateral * (10000 - stalenessBufferBps) / 10000;
    // require(discountedCollateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral after staleness adjustment");
    ```
