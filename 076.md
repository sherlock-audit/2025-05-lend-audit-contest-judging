# Cross-Chain Borrow Repayment Incorrectly Updates Same-Chain Borrow Balances

### Summary

When a user repays a cross-chain borrow, the system incorrectly updates or removes same-chain borrow data. This can lead to inaccurate debt tracking, causing either the user to owe less than they should or more than they actually borrowed.


### Root Cause

In the repayBorrowInternal function, when repaying a  borrow (either full or partial), the protocol updates same-chain borrow state using updateBorrowBalance or removes borrow data using removeBorrowBalance. However, this logic is also applied for cross-chain borrow repayments, which should not modify same-chain borrow mappings. Since cross-chain borrow data is managed in separate crossChainBorrows or crossChainCollaterals mappings, applying same-chain logic can corrupt user balances or lead to inconsistent states.

As a result valid local dept can be removed if `repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount` or a dept `borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal` can be added to local state .

```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        
        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }
        ...

        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user has an active cross-chain borrow stored in crossChainCollaterals or crossChainBorrows.
User also has local dept for same token
The user initiates a repayment on the destination chain.


### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User borrows 100 tokens cross-chain (e.g., from Chain A to Chain B) and 100 tokens locally
2. The borrow is stored under crossChainCollaterals on the destination chain.
3. User repays all cross chain dept 
4. The function wrongly  deletes borrow data in the same-chain borrow mappings
5. This results in Incorrectly cleared debt for local borrow 


### Impact

Repaying a cross-chain borrow may remove local borrow if it exist 
or incorrectly modify and increase unrelated same-chain borrow state.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only update same-chain borrow balances if _isSameChain == true. For cross-chain borrows, create separate logic
