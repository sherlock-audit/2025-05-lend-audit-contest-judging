# User Lockout Due to Invalid Invariant in `borrowWithInterest`

## Summary
The incorrect invariant in `borrowWithInterest` requiring either `crossChainBorrows` or `crossChainCollaterals` to be empty for a user and token on a chain causes `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to revert when both are populated, completely blocking users from performing actions such as borrowing or redeeming on the affected chain.

## Root Cause
In `LendStorage.sol`, the `borrowWithInterest` function includes a `require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0)` check, assuming that a user cannot have both `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` populated for the same token on a single chain. This invariant is violated when a user borrows cross-chain to a chain (populating `crossChainCollaterals`) and also initiates a cross-chain borrow from that chain (populating `crossChainBorrows`), causing a revert in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The user needs to have collateral on Chain A (e.g., $1000 USDC in a cUSDC pool).
2. The user needs to borrow cross-chain from Chain A to Chain B for a token (e.g., cUSDC), populating `crossChainCollaterals` on Chain B.
3. The user needs to supply collateral on Chain B (e.g., $1000 USDC) and borrow cross-chain from Chain B to Chain C for the same token, populating `crossChainBorrows` on Chain B.
4. The protocol needs to support cross-chain borrowing across at least three chains (A, B, C).

## External Pre-conditions
1. The underlying token prices (e.g., USDC) need to remain stable to ensure consistent collateral and borrow valuations.
2. The LayerZero V2 network needs to process cross-chain borrow requests correctly to establish the loans.
3. The oracle price feed for lTokens needs to be consistent to avoid unrelated reverts.

## Attack Path
1. A user supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A in a cUSDC pool.
2. The user borrows 500 USDC cross-chain on Chain B for cUSDC, registering the loan in `crossChainCollaterals` on Chain B via `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`.
3. The user supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain B in a cUSDC pool.
4. The user borrows 500 USDC cross-chain on Chain C for cUSDC, registering the loan in `crossChainBorrows` on Chain B via `_handleValidBorrowRequest`.
5. The user attempts to call `borrow` on Chain B to borrow additional USDC:
   - `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calls `borrowWithInterest` for cUSDC.
   - `borrowWithInterest` detects non-empty `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` for the user and cUSDC, reverting with "Invariant violated: both mappings populated".
6. The user is blocked from all actions on Chain B (e.g., `borrow`, `repay`, `redeem`), freezing their collateral and loans.

## Impact
Users are completely locked out from interacting with the protocol on Chain B, unable to borrow, repay, redeem collateral, or liquidate, rendering their funds (e.g., 1000 USDC collateral) inaccessible. 

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy Lend-V2 on three chains: Chain A, Chain B, and Chain C. A user supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A in a cUSDC pool.
- The user borrows 500 USDC cross-chain on Chain B for cUSDC, registering the loan in `crossChainCollaterals` on Chain B.
- The user supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain B in a cUSDC pool.
- The user borrows 500 USDC cross-chain on Chain C for cUSDC, registering the loan in `crossChainBorrows` on Chain B.
- The user attempts to call `borrow` on Chain B for 100 USDC:
  - `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calls `borrowWithInterest` for cUSDC.
  - `borrowWithInterest` finds non-empty `crossChainBorrows` (500 USDC to Chain C) and `crossChainCollaterals` (500 USDC from Chain A), reverting with "Invariant violated: both mappings populated".
- The user is blocked from all actions on Chain B, freezing 1000 USDC collateral and 500 USDC loan.
