# No reentrancy protection when `supply` and `redeem`

## Summary
The supply function allows users to supply tokens to mint lTokens in the Compound protocol. However The missing validation for _token in the supply() function can lead to a drain of tokens in the  market, as an attacker can pass a fake collateral token to get a callback to their fake collateral contract in between the execution after the supply.
## Description
```solidity
     * @dev Allows users to supply tokens to mint lTokens in the Compound protocol.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to supply.
     * @param _token The address of the token to be supplied.
     */
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");

        // Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);

        // Get exchange rate before mint
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
```
As we can see no validation on the token supplied to the contract allowing a malicious user to add an underlying token with a callback to drain protocol
## Attack Path 
1. Attacker calls supply(), with _collateral=FakeToken, and a large _Amount
2. The FakeToken contract re-enters the Lend contract, calling supply() again, with a small _Amount
3. The reentrant call to lsupply() finishes by calling redeem since appoval for large token is given it would allow attacker redeem a large sum of assets 
## Impact
Assets supplied can be drained
## Recommended Mitigation
Add a re-entrancy protection
