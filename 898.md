# The supply() Function May Inflate lToken Minting

### Summary

When minting lTokens in the supply() function, the token amounts can be inflated.
Users mint lTokens by calling the supply() function in CoreRouter.sol. 
This function uses the mint() function from LErc20Interface to mint lTokens. Specifically, the mint() function in LErc20.sol handles the actual minting process.
The call flow of LErc20.sol’s mint() function is as follows:
mint() → mintInternal() → mintFresh() → doTransferIn()
As noted in the comment below, the doTransferIn() function does not guarantee an exact transfer of the specified amount due to potential fees. 
This means doTransferIn() may transfer less than the requested amount and returns the actual transferred amount.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L1148
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Performs a transfer in, reverting upon failure. Returns the amount actually transferred to the protocol, in case of a fee.
 *  This may revert due to insufficient balance or insufficient allowance.
 */
function doTransferIn(address from, uint256 amount) internal virtual returns (uint256);
```
Accordingly, as shown in the code below, the mintFresh() function calculates the amount of lTokens to mint based on the actual transferred tokens, not the requested amount:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L422
```solidity
function mintFresh(address minter, uint256 mintAmount) internal {
	...
        /*
         *  We call `doTransferIn` for the minter and the mintAmount.
         *  Note: The lToken must handle variations between ERC-20 and ETH underlying.
         *  `doTransferIn` reverts if anything goes wrong, since we can't be sure if
         *  side-effects occurred. The function returns the amount actually transferred,
         *  in case of a fee. On success, the lToken holds an additional `actualMintAmount`
         *  of cash.
         */
        uint256 actualMintAmount = doTransferIn(minter, mintAmount);

        /*
         * We get the current exchange rate and calculate the number of lTokens to be minted:
         *  mintTokens = actualMintAmount / exchangeRate
         */

        uint256 mintTokens = div_(actualMintAmount, exchangeRate);
	...
    }
```
However, the supply() function in CoreRouter.sol incorrectly calculates the minted lToken amount using the supplied token amount (_amount) instead of the actual transferred amount.
This miscalculated lToken amount is then used to update the totalInvestment variable in LendStorage.sol, disrupting the system’s proper functioning.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61
```solidity
function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
	...
        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
	...
	lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
        );

    }
```

### Root Cause

none

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact


The incorrectly updated totalInvestment variable causes malfunction in both getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() and distributeSupplierLend() functions, disrupting the proper operation of the system. 
Additionally, this may lead to inflation of lTokens.
