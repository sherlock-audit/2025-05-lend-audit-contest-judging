# [High] Users will be denied legitimate borrow requests due to double interest calculation

### Summary

Double-counting the `borrowIndex` inside `CoreRouter.borrow()` will cause an overstated debt check and, therefore, unjust reverts / premature liquidations for borrowers as any borrower that already has an open position will call `borrow()` (or be evaluated for liquidity) after interest has accrued.

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:L152-L159`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L159) the variable `borrowed` already contains the latest interest, but it is multiplied again by `borrowIndex/currentBorrow.borrowIndex`, inflating the required‐debt figure (`borrowAmount`) used in the collateral check.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user already borrowed from the same `lToken`  -> (so `currentBorrow.borrowIndex > 0` is stored).
2. At least one block has passed and interest has accrued, i.e. `LToken.borrowIndex()` > `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` (a few days of normal market utilisation is enough).
3. The user’s collateral ratio is close to the collateral factor (≈ 70-75 %), which is common for high-leverage users.

### External Pre-conditions

None required; no external protocol changes are needed.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower supplies 1,000 DAI (1000e18) of the underlying asset and enters the corresponding market (`collateralFactorMantissa` = 0.75).
2. Borrower immediately borrows 740 DAI, leaving the account just below the 75 % limit but still solvent.
3. ~30 days pass (≈ 216 000 blocks are rolled); `accrueInterest()` is executed once, which increases the `borrowIndex`.
4. Borrower supplies an additional 5 DAI  of the same underlying token to maintain a small buffer above the real debt calculated with the updated `borrowIndex`.
5. Borrower calls `borrow(1 DAI)` to obtain a additional loan.
6. Inside `CoreRouter.borrow()`
   6.1 `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is invoked, returning `borrowed` that already reflects the interest accumulated in step 3;
   6.2 the code multiplies this `borrowed` value again by `currentBorrowIndex / storedBorrowIndex`, creating an overstated debt (`borrowAmountWrong`);
   6.3 the contract compares the legitimate collateral value with the inflated debt, finds an apparent shortfall, and reverts with “Insufficient collateral”.
7. The same erroneous comparison is used by the liquidation checks, so any liquidator can trigger `liquidateBorrow()` against the account even though the account is actually collateralised when calculated correctly.

### Impact

The borrowers cannot draw additional credit and can be liquidated prematurely, losing up to 100 % * (liquidation-incentive) of their collateral while no real shortfall exists. The attacker (liquidator) gains the seized collateral at a discount.

### PoC

```solidity

        address token  = supportedTokens[0];
        address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

        // Adjust parameters: First borrowing approaches collateral limit.                
        uint256 supply1 = 1000e18;  
        uint256 borrow1 = 740e18;
        uint256 supply2 = 5e18;      

        // mint ERC token
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, supply1 + supply2);

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), type(uint256).max);

        // 1. supply & First Borrowing
        coreRouter.supply(supply1, token);
        coreRouter.borrow(borrow1, token);

        // uint256 _currentIdx = LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex();
        // console.log("_currentIdx", _currentIdx); // _currentIdx 1014075342465400000


        // 3. Tops up 5 (5e18) collateral
        coreRouter.supply(supply2, token);

        // 4. Calculate the state after borrowing 1 wei.
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = 
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
                deployer, LToken(payable(lToken)), 0, 1e18
            );
        
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory st = 
            lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(deployer, lToken);
        uint256 storedIdx = st.borrowIndex;
        uint256 currentIdx = LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex();

        // Incorrect algorithm: after double counting interest.
        uint256 borrowAmountWrong = (borrowed * currentIdx) / storedIdx;

        
        assertTrue(collateral >= borrowed,         "correct model should pass"); 
        assertTrue(collateral < borrowAmountWrong, "incorrect model should trigger ERROR"); 

        // 5. expectRevert
        vm.expectRevert("Insufficient collateral");
        coreRouter.borrow(1e18, token);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    /* ------------------------------------------------ *
     *                 helper: mint+approve               *
     * ------------------------------------------------ */
    function _mintAndApprove(address token, uint256 amt) internal {
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, amt);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amt);
    }
```

### Mitigation

In `CoreRouter.borrow()` replace
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = borrowed;
```
