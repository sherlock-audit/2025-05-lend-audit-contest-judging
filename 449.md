# DOS of borrowWithInterest function

### Summary

if  borrowWithInterest function is triggered in chain A, which is used to calculate total cross chain borrows of a user,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L493
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;


        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];


        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
```
here _lToken = borrowed  LToken in chain B , so calling it in chain A will revert.
so borrowWithInterest function will revert if user has cross chain borrows.
This will DOS all functions which uses this borrowWithInterest function.

### Root Cause

calling _ltoken of one chain in other chain 

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

none 

### Impact

DOS of all functions which uses borrowWithInterest function
