# Users are underpaid when redeeming

### Summary

Users are often underpaid when redeeming lTokens and some assets become stuck in CoreRouter due to protocol using slightly outdated exchange rate

### Root Cause

Borrow index of the lToken isn't updated before redeeming so `expectedUnderlying` will often turn out slightly less than what coreRouter receives when calling redeem(). Because of this, users are often not paid in full and a bit of underlying token is stuck in coreRouter.
```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
@>      uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
@>      uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

        // Perform redeem
@>      require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

        // Update total investment
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
        uint256 newInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) - _amount;
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, newInvestment);

        if (newInvestment == 0) {
            lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        }

        emit RedeemSuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, expectedUnderlying, _amount);

        return 0;
    }

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User A supplies some assets
2. Some time passes and user A redeems his assets, but prior to his transaction interest wasn't updated/accrued on the lToken for several blocks
3. A discrepancy between `exchangeRateBefore` and the exchange rate that was used when coreRouter redeemed the token makes user A not receive some amount of the asset and this amount is stuck in coreRouter.

### Impact

Users are often underpaid when redeeming and some assets become stuck in CoreRouter forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the borrow index of the lToken before getting the exchange rate for calculation
