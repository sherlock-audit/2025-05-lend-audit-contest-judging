# Incorrect Comparison in Borrow Liquidity Check

## Finding description and impact

The `borrow` function uses `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to fetch `borrowed` and `collateral` values.

```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
```

The returned `borrowed` already includes the effect of the new borrow `_amount`. Yet the code mistakenly applies an additional adjustment:

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L162

This re-adjusts a value that has already accounted for the future borrow amount, introducing two problems:

* It distorts the actual borrowing limit comparison.
* It leads to incorrect rejections or acceptance of borrow attempts based on inflated `borrowAmount`.

The root cause is a misunderstanding of what the `borrowed` value returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` represents. Since it already includes the proposed borrow amount, no further adjustment should be made before comparing with `collateral`.

## mitigation

Replace the incorrect calculation with a direct comparison:

```solidity
require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

Remove the calculation of `borrowAmount` entirely:

```solidity
// Delete this block
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;
```
