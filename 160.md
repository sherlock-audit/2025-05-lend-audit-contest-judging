# Improper Fee Handling in CrossChainRouter

### Summary

Incorrect fee handling in the CrossChainRouter's `_send` function will cause a severe economic vulnerability for users as attackers will deposit minimal ETH to grief the contract's cross-chain functionality or users will unknowingly spend excessive ETH on transactions.

### Root Cause

In CrossChainRouter.sol the contract incorrectly passes its entire ETH balance as the fee parameter to LayerZero:

Instead of calculating the actual required fee using a quote mechanism, the contract passes `address(this).balance` as the `nativeFee` parameter to the `MessagingFee` constructor, which means the entire contract's ETH balance is allocated for the cross-chain message fee.


### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowCrossChain` with ETH for fees, unaware that the entire contract balance (including pre-existing ETH) will be used as the fee.
2. The function executes, calling `_send` which uses the entire contract balance (pre-existing + user-provided ETH) as the fee.
3. The transaction completes, but the user has unknowingly paid more than necessary for the cross-chain operation.

### Impact

1. For payable functions like `borrowCrossChain`: Users pay excessive fees for cross-chain operations as the entire contract balance (not just their contributed amount) is used for fees. The difference between the actual required fee and the contract's balance is lost.

### Mitigation

Implement proper fee quoting before sending messages:

```solidity
function _send(
    uint32 _dstEid,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _borrowIndex,
    uint256 _collateral,
    address _sender,
    address _destlToken,
    address _liquidator,
    address _srcToken,
    ContractType ctype
) internal {
    bytes memory payload =
        abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);
    
    bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);
    
    // Get quote for the actual required fee
    MessagingFee memory fee = _quote(_dstEid, payload, options, false);
    
    // Verify sufficient balance
    require(address(this).balance >= fee.nativeFee, "Insufficient balance for fee");
    
    // Send with the exact fee amount
    _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, fee, payable(address(this)));
}
```
