# Users' market entries can silently fail leading to blocked protocol actions

### Summary

Lack of success validation in `enterMarkets()` will cause users to believe they have entered markets when they haven't, leading to failed subsequent operations that require market entry.

### Root Cause

In both [CrossChainRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L678) and [CoreRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L434) the enterMarkets() functions don't check the return values from [Lendtroller.enterMarkets(),](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/Lendtroller.sol#L136C5-L152C6) which returns an array of success/failure codes for each market entry attempt.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must attempt to enter a market
2. Market entry must fail silently (e.g., market not listed)
3. User proceeds with operations requiring market entry

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User calls function requiring market entry (e.g., borrow)
2. enterMarkets() is called internally
3. Market entry fails but error is not caught
4. Function continues execution assuming successful market entry
5. Later operations fail or behave unexpectedly

### Impact

Confusion about protocol state This breaks core protocol functionality and creates user friction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add return value checks in both routers
```diff
function enterMarkets(address _lToken) internal {
    address[] memory lTokens = new address[](1);
    lTokens[0] = _lToken;
    uint[] memory results = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).enterMarkets(lTokens);
+   require(results[0] == 0, "Enter market failed");
}
```
