# User can simultaneously borrow on multiple chains bypassing collateral factor multiple times

### Summary

The protocol fails to track in-flight cross-chain borrow requests, allowing users to initiate multiple simultaneous borrows to different chains before any complete. Since validation occurs before the asynchronous cross-chain messaging finishes, all requests pass individual checks but collectively exceed the user's borrowing capacity, creating systemic undercollateralization.

### Root Cause

Cross-chain borrowing relies on messaging with no mechanism to track pending requests. When `borrowCrossChain()` is called, it performs validation against the current state without accounting for other simultaneous borrows that may be in-flight to different chains. The validation gap exists between when the source chain approves the borrow and when the destination chain completes it.

Each [`borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) call independently calculates available capacity based only on completed borrows, ignoring concurrent requests that haven't yet been recorded in the system state.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A (worth $1000, 80% collateral factor = $800 borrowing capacity)
2. User has no existing borrows (clean slate)
3. User simultaneously initiates three cross-chain borrows (via smart contract or rapid transaction submission):
   - Chain A → Chain B: Borrow $700
   - Chain A → Chain C: Borrow $700  
   - Chain A → Chain D: Borrow $700
4. All three `borrowCrossChain()` calls execute on Chain A and pass validation (each sees $800 available capacity)
5. LayerZero messages are sent to all three destination chains
6. All destination chains eventually process their respective borrow requests
7. **Result**: User has borrowed $2100 total against $800 capacity (262.5% utilization)

Each individual validation passes because:
- Chain B borrow: $700 ≤ $800 capacity ✓
- Chain C borrow: $700 ≤ $800 capacity ✓  
- Chain D borrow: $700 ≤ $800 capacity ✓

### Impact

**High** - Race condition enables massive overcollateralization and protocol insolvency:

1. Users can borrow multiples of their actual capacity by exploiting asynchronous messaging delays
2. Creates systematic undercollateralization across multiple chains simultaneously
3. Positions become unliquidatable when total debt far exceeds collateral value
4. Protocol faces significant bad debt that cannot be recovered through normal liquidation
5. More severe than single-chain exploits due to cross-chain coordination complexity
6. Amplified risk during network congestion when LayerZero message delays increase

With sufficient chains, a user could potentially borrow 10x+ their actual capacity by timing requests across multiple destination chains before any complete.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Implement pending request tracking to reserve borrowing capacity during cross-chain operations. The source chain should maintain a mapping of in-flight borrow amounts per user and deduct this from available capacity when validating new requests. Release reserved capacity when cross-chain operations complete or fail.
