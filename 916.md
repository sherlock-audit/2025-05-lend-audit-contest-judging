# Absence of Slippage Protection in Supply and Redeem Operations

## Description

The CoreRouter's `supply` and `redeem` functions lack adequate slippage protection mechanisms, exposing users to potential financial losses due to unfavorable price movements during transaction execution. This vulnerability occurs when:

1. **Supply Function**: Users deposit tokens without specifying minimum expected minting token amount
2. **Redeem Function**: Users withdraw underlying tokens without setting minimum expected output amounts.

The absence of slippage protection allows transactions to execute even when market conditions change significantly between transaction submission and execution, particularly during the exchange rate votality due MEV or any market losses.

## Impact
Users will suffer a loss due to slippage while supplying or redeeming.

## Recommendation

Implement Slippage Protection Parameters in `supply` and `redeem` functions
