# Double LEND Reward Claim via Cross-Chain Borrow Representation

### Summary

In the cross-chain borrow flow, a user's borrow is tracked both on the source chain and the destination chain. While this is necessary for accounting, it creates a reward distribution vulnerability. The user can call the `CoreRouter.sol#claimLend()` separately on each chain and receive LEND rewards twice for the same borrow, once from the `crossChainBorrows` mapping on the source chain and once from the `crossChainCollaterals` mapping on the destination chain. This effectively results in double reward claims for a single borrowing action.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that cross-chain borrows are recorded independently in both `crossChainBorrows` on the source chain and `crossChainCollaterals` on the destination chain, and the reward distribution logic does not distinguish or consolidate these mirrored records. As a result, both entries are treated as separate eligible borrow positions when calculating and distributing LEND rewards, allowing users to claim rewards twice for the same borrowing action.

Keep in mind that I have other issues about `LendStorage.sol#borrowWithInterest()` , specifically the if statements in the function. If fixed, users will be able to claim double rewards.

### Attack Path

An attacker can initiate a cross-chain borrow, which gets recorded both in the `crossChainBorrows` mapping on the source chain and in the `crossChainCollaterals` mapping on the destination chain. The reward distribution logic treats these as distinct borrow records. The attacker can then call `CoreRouter.sol#claimLend()` separately on both chains. Since reward calculations independently read from `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals`, the attacker will receive duplicate LEND rewards for the same borrowing action, once per chain, resulting in double rewards.

### Impact

Users can exploit the system to receive duplicate LEND rewards by claiming rewards on both chains for the same cross-chain borrow.
