# Liquidator will steal underlying tokens without providing any collateral from the protocol

### Summary

The missing validation of liquidator's token transfer in `liquidateCrossChain()` will cause a direct theft of underlying tokens from the protocol as liquidators can trigger cross-chain liquidations without providing any collateral, allowing them to receive tokens when the liquidation fails.

### Root Cause

 In `CrossChainRouter.sol` contract, when a user calls [liquidateCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L172) function, there is no check or transfer of tokens from the liquidator before initiating the cross-chain liquidation process.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have underlying tokens in the contract
2. A valid borrower position must exist that can be liquidated
3. The liquidation amount must be within the max liquidation bounds

### External Pre-conditions

`_checkLiquidationValid` returns false

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a valid borrower position to liquidate
2. Attacker calls liquidateCrossChain() with valid parameters but without transferring any tokens
3. The function proceeds through _validateAndPrepareLiquidation and _executeLiquidation
4. When the message reaches Chain A, _checkLiquidationValid returns false
5. This triggers _sendLiquidationFailure back to Chain B
6. _handleLiquidationFailure executes and transfers underlying tokens to the attacker
7. The attacker receives tokens despite never providing any

```solidity
function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
@>        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```

### Impact

The protocol suffers a direct loss of underlying tokens equal to the liquidation amount. The attacker gains these tokens without providing any collateral or payment, essentially stealing from the protocol's reserves.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add token transfer validation before initiating the cross-chain liquidation
