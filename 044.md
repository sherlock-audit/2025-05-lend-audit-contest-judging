# Ambiguous Return Value in findCrossChainBorrow Causes Borrow Record Confusion

### Summary

Returning (false, 0) in findCrossChainBorrow will cause unintended borrow record processing for callers as an attacker will exploit this ambiguity by submitting crafted borrow requests or relying on default index assumptions.

In Solidity:

Array indexing starts at 0: the first element is at index 0.

Returning (false, 0) blurs the distinction between “no entry found” and “entry found at index 0”.

A caller might:

(bool found, uint256 index) = findCrossChainBorrow(user, underlying, srcEid, destEid, lToken);
if (index < userBorrows.length) {
    Borrow memory borrow = userBorrows[index]; // Dangerous if found == false!
    process(borrow);
}
This could lead to processing a wrong borrow record if index == 0 and no record actually exists.

### Root Cause

In Lendstorage.sol:findCrossChainBorrow, the fallback return value is set to (false, 0), which returns index 0 even when no record is found. This value is a valid index for borrow records, which can cause callers to misinterpret it and incorrectly process the wrong borrow record.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user or protocol logic calls findCrossChainBorrow to locate a borrow record.

The userBorrows array for that user and underlying token is empty or does not contain the target record.

The caller code does not check the found flag and proceeds to use the returned index.

### External Pre-conditions

There is no validation at the external callsite to confirm the existence of the borrow record before processing.

External actors (e.g., attackers or misconfigured protocols) can submit calls to findCrossChainBorrow and trigger the fallback (false, 0) result.

### Attack Path

A user or attacker invokes findCrossChainBorrow with parameters that do not match any existing borrow record.

The function returns (false, 0), which can be misinterpreted by the caller as a valid index.

The caller proceeds to access userBorrows[0], even though the record wasn’t found, potentially causing incorrect borrow processing.

The attacker can exploit this by crafting borrow requests or relying on default index assumptions, leading to unauthorized repayments, liquidations, or miscalculations in user positions.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from potential unauthorized borrow processing or liquidation. An attacker might:

Repay or liquidate a borrow that does not exist (based on default index 0).

Cause loss of funds to the protocol or other users if the incorrect borrow is processed (e.g., repaying a valid borrow at index 0 when it should not be).

Trigger incorrect calculations in downstream logic (e.g., interest calculations, cross-chain position tracking).

The approximate loss could range from a small precision error to a full loss of a position's value in edge cases. The attacker might gain access to unauthorized borrow records or cause liquidation of an innocent user.

### PoC

Scenario Setup
Alice has multiple cross-chain borrows, including at index 0.

Bob (an attacker or misconfigured protocol) or the system logic attempts to look up a cross-chain borrow with parameters that do not match any record for a user (e.g., an invalid combination of underlying, srcEid, destEid, borrowedlToken).

The function returns (false, 0) — signaling "not found" but also returning index 0.

Steps
1️⃣ Bob calls findCrossChainBorrow:


(bool found, uint256 index) = findCrossChainBorrow(alice, USDC, 123, 456, lUSDT);
But no matching borrow exists for these parameters.

2️⃣ Return Value:

The function returns (false, 0) because the loop finishes without a match.

found == false, but index == 0 (default fallback).

3️⃣ Caller Misinterprets Result:

Bob (or a misconfigured protocol) fails to check the found flag and assumes index 0 is valid.

Bob accesses:


Borrow memory borrow = crossChainBorrows[alice][USDC][0];
This processes Alice's actual borrow at index 0, which could have completely different parameters and unrelated obligations.

4️⃣ Exploitation:

Bob could repay or liquidate Alice's valid borrow at index 0 without proper authorization.

If used in automated systems, this could cause incorrect debt tracking, loss of user funds, or improper cross-chain settlement.



### Mitigation

Replace the fallback return value with an impossible index:

return (false, type(uint256).max);
This signals that no valid record was found.

Enforce callers to check the found flag before using the index value.

Document this behavior explicitly in the function comments and external interface documentation.
