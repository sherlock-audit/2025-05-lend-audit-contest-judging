# Interest is not accrued when calculating collateral and borrowed amount in `CoreRouter::redeem()`, which can lead to protocol insolvency

### Summary

Interest must be accrued every time when a user interacts with the core functions of the protocol, especially when collateral or debt is calculated since it's accruing interest on every call. However this is not the case in `CoreRouter::redeem()`, which will allow the user to operate with outdated exchange rate.

### Root Cause

As can be seen in [CoreRouter::redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100-L112)

```javascript
function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");
        ...
```

Interest is not acrrued on the LToken before calling the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385-L466), which is crutial, since this function is responsible for calculating the current status of the users (current collateral and current borrowed amount) in this case it protects undercollateralized positions. When a user redeems (withdraws) their collateral, the protocol must ensure they are still solvent afterward, meaning their remaining collateral is still sufficient to cover their borrows. Since the `accrueInterest` function is not called a borrower can withdraw his all of his collateral while still owning an outstanding loan, causing protocol insolvency. For example interest is accrued before the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is called upon borrows, ensuring users can borrow up to their collateral limits.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User must have a borrow position.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

No need, the implementation logic itself causes it.

### Impact

Can lead to protocol insolvency, since it's not reflecting the current rates/indexes causing user to withdraw when he should not.

### PoC

_No response_
