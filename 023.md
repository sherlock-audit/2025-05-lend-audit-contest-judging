# Incorrect lToken Mint Amount Calculation in `CoreRouter`

### Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract incorrectly calculates the number of minted `lTokens` during the supply operation by relying on a stale exchange rate from `exchangeRateStored()` before the actual minting. However, the minting process (`mint()`) correctly triggers `accrueInterest()` internally. As a result, the exchange rate used to compute `mintTokens` may be outdated, causing an inaccurate record of the user’s deposited amount. This inconsistency could allow users to redeem more tokens than they originally supplied.




### Root Cause

The logic flow in [`CoreRouter`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74) attempts to compute the number of `lTokens` a user receives for supplying an asset as follows:

```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Mint lTokens
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

// Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

Here, `exchangeRateStored()` is used to fetch the exchange rate prior to calling `mint()`. However, `exchangeRateStored()` only returns the cached rate and **does not** call `accrueInterest()`:

```solidity
function exchangeRateStored() public view override returns (uint256) {
    return exchangeRateStoredInternal();
}
```

Meanwhile, the `mint()` function correctly accrues interest before minting:

```solidity
function mint(uint256 mintAmount) external override returns (uint256) {
    mintInternal(mintAmount);
    return NO_ERROR;
}

function mintInternal(uint256 mintAmount) internal nonReentrant {
    accrueInterest();
    mintFresh(msg.sender, mintAmount);
}
```

Therefore, by the time tokens are minted, the actual exchange rate has increased (due to interest accrual), meaning the tokens minted are fewer than calculated using the stale `exchangeRateBefore`. Despite this, `mintTokens` is still calculated using the outdated rate and used in storage updates:

```solidity
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    msg.sender, _lToken,
    lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
);
```

This results in the system **overstating** the user’s `lToken` balance in storage.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Some interest should be exist in the pool

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

No needed

### Impact


This leads to a mismatch between the actual number of `lTokens` minted and the amount recorded in the protocol’s internal accounting. A user could exploit this by immediately redeeming their tokens, receiving more than they originally supplied. 

This attack vector makes flash loan attacks feasible. Attacker can flashloan big amount of tokens supply it and then redeem it by getting almost 100% of the interest and then he can repay his flashloan fee and he can steal the interest with this attack vector.


### Mitigation

Check supply difference instead
