### Attack Path

If the user executes too many borrows, the returned `userBorrows` at Line 657 will contain a lot of items. As a result, the for-loop at Line 659 will be out of gas and revert the entire transaction that depends on the `findCrossChainBorrow()` function internally.

```solidity
File: LendStorage.sol
650:     function findCrossChainBorrow(
651:         address user,
652:         address underlying,
653:         uint256 srcEid,
654:         uint256 destEid,
655:         address borrowedlToken
656:     ) public view returns (bool, uint256) {
657:         Borrow[] memory userBorrows = crossChainBorrows[user][underlying];
658: 
659:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < userBorrows.length;) {
..SNIP..
669:         }
670:         return (false, 0);
671:     }

```

The same issue occurs for the `findCrossChainCollateral()` function.

```solidity
File: LendStorage.sol
683:     function findCrossChainCollateral(
684:         address user,
685:         address underlying,
686:         uint256 srcEid,
687:         uint256 destEid,
688:         address borrowedlToken,
689:         address srcToken
690:     ) public view returns (bool, uint256) {
691:         Borrow[] memory userCollaterals = crossChainCollaterals[user][underlying];
692: 
693:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCollaterals.length;) {
..SNIP..
703:         }
704:         return (false, 0);
705:     }
```

The above-mentioned functions are used in many critical features of the protocol. Following are some of the impacts or implications of this issue:

- `findCrossChainBorrow` is used in `_handleDestRepayMessage` and `_handleValidBorrowRequest`. Thus cross-chain borrowing and repayment might fail. Users might not be able to repay their debt, causing their debt to accumulate and be unfairly liquidated.

- `findCrossChainCollateral` is used in `_handleLiquidationSuccess`. Thus, cross-chain liquidation might fail. This can be chained into more serious implications as the borrower being liquidated by a liquidator can add or populate a large number of dust positions in the `crossChainCollaterals` to intentionally cause a revert to block or DOS the liquidation of their account. In this case, liquidation cannot be executed, and bad debt will remain and accumulate in the protocol, leading to a loss of funds.

There are also many other unbounded array issues found in the codebase that they should be grouped together as duplicates.
