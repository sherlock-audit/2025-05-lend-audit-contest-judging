# LayerZero fee is not actually refunded to the paying user

### Summary

The CrossChainRouter.sol contract uses _lzSend to perform LayerZero messaging, where users are expected to supply fees to cover cross-chain operations. According to the _lzSend documentation, any excess fee should be refunded to the user via the _refundAddress parameter. However, in practice, functions like _send call _lzSend use the contractâ€™s address as the refund recipient. This leads to users losing any leftover funds, since refunds are sent to the contract instead of the user who paid. As a result, all user-facing functions that rely on _send are affected by this flaw and can cause unfair loss of user funds.

### Root Cause

The LayerZero fee is supposed to cover cross-chain messaging for user operations performed on `CrossChainRouter.sol`. Any excess fee is supposed to be refunded to the initiator of the transaction. This fee will be paid by users who provide a balance to the contract when calling certain user functions, for example, `borrowCrossChain` with a certain call value to cover the fee. Instead, `_lzSend` is called using the contract itself (`CrossChainRouter.sol`) as the repayment address, which will lead to loss of funds for users who expect the excess fee to be returned to them, as mentioned in the documentation of `_lzSend`

    /**
     * @dev Internal function to interact with the LayerZero EndpointV2.send() for sending a message.
     * @param _dstEid The destination endpoint ID.
     * @param _message The message payload.
     * @param _options Additional options for the message.
     * @param _fee The calculated LayerZero fee for the message.
     *      - nativeFee: The native fee.
     *      - lzTokenFee: The lzToken fee.
@>   * @param _refundAddress The address to receive any excess fee values sent to the endpoint.
     * @return receipt The receipt for the sent message.
     *      - guid: The unique identifier for the sent message.
     *      - nonce: The nonce of the sent message.
     *      - fee: The LayerZero fee incurred for the message.

This can result in unfair treatment of the user/sender who provides the funds for initiating cross-chain calls without receiving back the excess fees.

All User functions that, at some point, call `_send` are affected by this issue. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

No Response

### External Pre-conditions

No Response

### Attack Path

A User calls the function `borrowCrossChain`  with a certain value of native token to pay for LZ Fees, which calls `_send`, but will not get a refund if the amount is in excess of the fee, since the refund address is set as the contract `CrossChainRouter` itself

### Impact

Loss of User funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an extra parameter to any afflicted functions to pass along the user's address as the refund address

```diff
    /**
     * @notice Sends LayerZero message
     */
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
-      ContractType ctype

+     address refundAdress
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), 
-	    payable(address(this))
+       payable(redundAddress));
    }
}
