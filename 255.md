# Malicious Liquidator Can Steal Value Without Repaying Borrow

### Summary

`CrossChainRouter.sol#liquidateCrossChain()` assumes that all internal on-chain calls will succeed on each destination chain after a LayerZero message is received. However, if a tx reverts during execution due to conditions like insufficient token balance (e.g. the liquidator doesnâ€™t have enough funds), then earlier messages will have already committed, leaving the system in an exploitable state. This is different from an ETH shortage: here, failure occurs purely due to state-dependent execution errors.

### Root Cause

`CrossChainRouter.sol#liquidateCrossChain()` assumes that all on-chain logic executed after receiving a LayerZero message will succeed. There are no safeguards (e.g. balance checks, precondition validation) to ensure the consistency of the multi-step cross-chain operation when intermediate on-chain calls fail. This leads to incomplete state transitions when any step reverts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `liquidateCrossChain()` on Chain B, initiating a cross-chain liquidation.

2. The first LayerZero message succeeds:

    On Chain A, the liquidator is credited with the seized collateral from the borrower.

3. The second message succeeds:

    On Chain B, the protocol attempts to collect the repayment from the liquidator and adjust debt records.

    But malicious user does not have enough balance/allowance and it reverts.

**As a result:**

   The liquidator keeps the seized collateral, despite not repaying the debt.

   The borrower's debt remains open, but his total investment is reduced.

### Impact

Malicious user can liquidate without repaying.
