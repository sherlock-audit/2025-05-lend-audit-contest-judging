# Incorrect Use of repayBorrow Instead of repayBorrowBehalf in Liquidation Flow

### Title
Incorrect Use of repayBorrow Instead of repayBorrowBehalf in Liquidation Flow

### Severity
High

### Difficulty
High
•	Any liquidation where the liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow(...)` will trigger this incorrect repayment path.
•	The code path is exercised whenever a liquidation is attempted, so it affects all liquidations until fixed.

### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol, Lend-V2/src/LErc20.sol, Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol

## Description
In `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowInternal(...)`, the contract calls:
```solidity
repayBorrowInternal(borrower, liquidator, repayAmount, borrowedlToken, true);
```
Inside `repayBorrowInternal`, this line executes the token‐level repayment:
```solidity
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
```
which call internal function `LToken.sol::repayBorrowInternal(repayAmount)`
at the same time this function calls `repayBorrowFresh` with msg.sender params and repayAmount:
```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(uint256 repayAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        accrueInterest();
        // repayBorrowFresh emits repay-borrow-specific logs on errors, so we don't need to
        repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, msg.sender, repayAmount);
    }
```
here we can see that both liquidator and borrower are `msg.sender` which is incorrect. 

Instead, function `LErc20.sol::repayBorrowBehalf` should be called which explicitly credits the repayment to the borrower’s debt using funds from the caller (liquidator or router). Failing to do so breaks the liquidation invariant: after “repaying” the borrower’s debt, the protocol believes the borrower still owes, so the subsequent call to:
```solidity
liquidateSeizeUpdate(...)
```
will compute seizeTokens based on an unchanged borrowed amount. This either a) prevents collateral seizure (liquidator cannot satisfy borrowed > collateral), or b) if somehow forced, allows seizing collateral without properly reducing debt.


It is wise to mention that this function also called from `CrossChainRouter: _handleRepayment` and `CrossChainRouter: _handleLiquidationSuccess` > `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()` > `_handleRepayment()`:
```solidity
        CoreRouter(coreRouter).repayCrossChainLiquidation(_borrower, repayer, repayAmountFinal, _lToken);
```

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	Alice owes 100 DAI on Market X. Bob (liquidator) has 50 DAI and notices Alice is under-collateralized.
	2.	Bob calls CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow(Alice, 50, lTokenCollateral, borrowedlToken)
	3.	Inside liquidateBorrowInternal, the code invokes repayBorrowInternal(Alice, Bob, 50, borrowedlToken, true).
	4.	That calls LErc20Interface(borrowedlToken).repayBorrow(50). Since msg.sender at the LToken level is CoreRouter, the LToken reduces CoreRouter’s own borrow balance by 50, but Alice’s borrow remains 100.
	5.	The router then proceeds to liquidateSeizeUpdate using borrowed = 100 and calculates how many collateral tokens to seize—effectively letting Bob seize collateral backing 100 DAI of debt, even though he only repaid 50 DAI. Alternatively, if CoreRouter had no borrow balance, repayBorrow(50) might revert or fail, blocking liquidation entirely—leaving Alice’s position unliquidated.

Either outcome breaks the protocol invariants: liquidators either seize too much collateral for too little repayment or are unable to liquidate any under-collateralized position.

## Recommendations
Replace the direct call to repayBorrow(...) with repayBorrowBehalf(borrower, ...) so that the repayment is credited to the borrower’s account. In liquidateBorrowInternal, modify:
```solidity
-        // Repay borrowed tokens
-        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
+        // Repay on behalf of the borrower, so borrower’s debt is reduced
+        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrowBehalf(borrower, repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
```
