# Cross-chain collateral double-counting in liquidity check enables unbounded leverage

### Summary

The per-chain liquidity check (`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`) sums up all locally supplied collateral but only considers local borrows ignoring remote, cross-chain borrow positions. 

An attacker can repeatedly borrow on Chain B against collateral supplied on Chain A, then switch back to Chain A (where their debt isn’t yet recorded) and borrow again, stacking leverage across chains far beyond intended limits.

### Root Cause

`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` uses two separate lists—`userSuppliedAssets` and `userBorrowedAssets`—both scoped to the current chain. Cross-chain borrows populate only the remote chain’s `userBorrowedAssets`, so the origin chain’s liquidity check treats those liabilities as zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

A user must have supplied collateral on Chain A and borrowed on Chain B via the cross-chain router.

### Attack Path

1. Supply collateral on Chain A via `CoreRouter.supply(...)`; `userSuppliedAssets[A]` includes your lToken.
2. Borrow on Chain B via `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain(...)`; collateral and borrow get recorded on Chain B only `(userBorrowedAssets[B])`.
3. Return to Chain A and call borrow again via `CoreRouter.borrow(...)` or another `borrowCrossChain` to yet another chain.
4. Repeat steps 2–3 across any number of chains. Each time on Chain A (or any origin), the local liquidity check sees full collateral but no corresponding borrow, so it overestimates your health and grants fresh credit.

### Impact

Unlimited leverage: collateral can be re-used across chains without ever registering the borrow locally.
