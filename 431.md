# Supply/Redeem logic does not handle 6-decimal tokens, leading to loss of funds

### Summary

The CoreRouter contract's supply and redeem functions assume all ERC20 tokens use 18 decimals by hardcoding calculations with 1e18. Many popular tokens (such as USDC and USDT) use 6 decimals. When users supply or redeem these tokens, the protocol miscalculates the number of lTokens minted or the amount of underlying tokens returned, resulting in users receiving far less than expected or losing funds entirely.

### Root Cause

Hardcoded calculations in:

- [supply -- line 80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80)
- [redeem -- line 118](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118)

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. User calls `supply` with 100 USDC deposited (1e6)
2. Protocol calculates `lTokens` with 1e18 math, returns 0 minted amount.
3. User attempts to redeem 100 USDC but has no lToken to redeem with.

### Impact

Whatever amount of USDC or 6 decimal tokens the user deposits with, the calculated lToken amount is off by 1e12. This makes it so the user can't redeem their collateral at all or drastically reduces the amount that they can claim back.

### PoC

Paste the following test in `TestRedeeming.t.sol` and see it pass

```solidity
function test_that_redeeming_does_not_work_with_six_dec_tokens() public {
        uint256 amount = 100e6; // 6 decimals

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // User successfully supplies tokens
        (, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

        // Get initial balances (LendStorage says 0 even though initial supply was successful)
        uint256 initialLTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);

        // Expect revert with zero redeem amount
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Zero redeem amount"));
        coreRouter.redeem(initialLTokenBalance, payable(lToken));

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Update the supply/redeem math to handle 6 decimal tokens.
