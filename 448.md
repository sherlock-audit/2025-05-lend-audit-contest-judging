# Underreported Collateral in `liquidateSeizeUpdate`

## Summary
The [liquidateSeizeUpdate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L278) function in `CoreRouter.sol` fails to call `addUserSuppliedAsset(sender, lTokenCollateral)` before updating `totalInvestment` for the liquidator’s seized collateral. If the collateral token (`lTokenCollateral`) is not already in the liquidator’s `userSuppliedAssets`, it is not registered as a supplied asset. This causes `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to exclude the seized collateral when calculating the liquidator’s collateral balance, underreporting their collateral and limiting their ability to borrow against or redeem it.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol`, the `liquidateSeizeUpdate` function updates the liquidator’s `totalInvestment` for `lTokenCollateral`:
```solidity
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    sender,
    lTokenCollateral,
    lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward)
);
```
However, it does not call `addUserSuppliedAsset(sender, lTokenCollateral)` beforehand. If `lTokenCollateral` is not already in `userSuppliedAssets[sender]`, the token is not added to the liquidator’s supplied assets. Consequently, `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` in `LendStorage.sol` skips this token during collateral calculation, as it only considers assets in `userSuppliedAssets`.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports liquidation, where liquidators seize collateral (`lTokenCollateral`) from borrowers.
2. `LendStorage.userSuppliedAssets` tracks supplied assets for users, used by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`.
3. `lendStorage` is the authorized contract for updating `totalInvestment` and `userSuppliedAssets`.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A borrower has a liquidatable position with collateral (e.g., $100 ETH) and a borrow (e.g., 50 USDC).
2. A liquidator initiates liquidation, seizing collateral tokens via `liquidateBorrow`.
3. The liquidator does not already have `lTokenCollateral` in their `userSuppliedAssets` (e.g., they never supplied this token).

## Attack Path
This issue does not require malicious intent but results in a functional flaw affecting liquidators. The steps are:

1. **Borrower’s Position**:
   - Borrower deposits $100 ETH as collateral and borrows 50 USDC, making their position liquidatable.

2. **Liquidation**:
   - Liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow`, repaying 25 USDC to seize ETH collateral (e.g., 25 lETH tokens).
   - `liquidateSeizeUpdate` updates `totalInvestment[sender][lTokenCollateral]` with seized tokens.

3. **Missing Asset Registration**:
   - `addUserSuppliedAsset(sender, lTokenCollateral)` is not called, so `lTokenCollateral` is not added to `userSuppliedAssets[sender]`.

4. **Collateral Underreporting**:
   - When `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is called (e.g., for borrowing or redeeming), it skips `lTokenCollateral` for the liquidator, as it’s not in `userSuppliedAssets`.
   - The liquidator’s collateral is underreported (e.g., $0 instead of $25 ETH).

5. **Impact**:
   - The liquidator cannot borrow against or redeem the seized collateral, limiting protocol functionality and potential indirect financial loss.

## Impact
- **Broken Core Functionality**: The underreporting of collateral prevents liquidators from using seized assets, breaking the protocol’s liquidation and collateral management functionality (Sherlock Section V).
- **Relevant Loss**: Liquidators lose the ability to utilize collateral worth >0.01% and >$10 (e.g., $25 ETH), meeting Medium severity criteria (Section V). The loss is indirect, as it constrains borrowing or redemption capacity.
- **Sherlock Criteria**: The issue occurs under specific conditions (liquidator lacking the collateral token in `userSuppliedAssets`), requiring external pre-conditions, aligning with Medium severity (Section V).

## Mitigation
Modify `liquidateSeizeUpdate` in `CoreRouter.sol` to call `addUserSuppliedAsset` before updating `totalInvestment`, ensuring the collateral token is registered. Update the code as follows:
```solidity
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
    address sender,
    address borrower,
    address lTokenCollateral,
    address borrowedlToken,
    uint256 repayAmount
) internal {
    (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
        .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
    require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");
    require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) >= seizeTokens, "Insufficient collateral");
    uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));
    if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
        currentReward = 0;
    }
    lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, sender);
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, borrower);
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
        borrower, lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) - seizeTokens
    );
    lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(sender, lTokenCollateral); // Add this line
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
        sender,
        lTokenCollateral,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward)
    );
    emit LiquidateBorrow(sender, borrowedlToken, borrower, lTokenCollateral);
}
```
This ensures `lTokenCollateral` is added to `userSuppliedAssets[sender]`, allowing `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to include the seized collateral in calculations.
