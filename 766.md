# protocol gives Lend tokens twice for same borrowed amount( once in chain A and once in chain B)

### Summary

if we observe distributeBorrowerLend function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L342-L375
```solidity
    function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external onlyAuthorized {
        // Trigger borrow index update
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerBorrowIndexUpdate(lToken);


        // Get the appropriate lend state based on whether it's for supply or borrow
        (uint224 borrowIndex,) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).lendBorrowState(lToken);


        uint256 borrowerIndex = lendBorrowerIndex[lToken][borrower];


        // Update borrowers's index to the current index since we are distributing accrued LEND
        lendBorrowerIndex[lToken][borrower] = borrowIndex;


        if (borrowerIndex == 0 && borrowIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
            // Covers the case where users borrowed tokens before the market's borrow state index was set.
            // Rewards the user with LEND accrued from the start of when borrower rewards were first
            // set for the market.
            borrowerIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX;
        }


        // Calculate change in the cumulative sum of the LEND per borrowed unit accrued
        Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(borrowIndex, borrowerIndex)});


        // Calculate the appropriate account balance and delta based on supply or borrow
        uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
            add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
            Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
        );


        // Calculate LEND accrued: lTokenAmount * accruedPerBorrowedUnit
        uint256 borrowerDelta = mul_(borrowerAmount, deltaIndex);


        uint256 borrowerAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[borrower], borrowerDelta);
        lendAccrued[borrower] = borrowerAccrued;
    }
```
here we can observe that it calculates both borrows with same chain and borrows with cross chains.If we see cross chain borrows,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;


        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];


        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
        return borrowedAmount;
    }
```
 here it added 
1)borrows with collateral in this chain and borrowed tokens in other chain,
2borrows with borrowed token in this chain and collateral in other chain,
while calculation of total borrows to which protocol gives corresponding Lend Tokens.
but here for the same borrowed tokens protocol giving Lend tokens in 2 chains were we give collateral and were we borrowed tokens.To understand this  let's say user borrowed 100 tokens of usdc in chain B giving collateral in chain A.
Then state in chain A,
crossChainBorrows[borrower][usdc] = 100*10^6.
state in chain B
crossChainCollaterals[borrower][usdc]=100*10^6.
if distributeBorrowerLend was triggered in chain A for usdc then 
only considering this cross chain borrowed amount for simple understanding 
borrowerAmount = 100*10^6.(For this protocol gives corresponding LendTokens).
if distributeBorroweLend was triggered in chainB for usdc then
borrowerAmount = 100*10^6. ( protocol will  gives corresponding LendTokens for this also).
This means protocol giving lend tokens twice ( once in chain A and in chain B) for same borrowed amount.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L365-L368
```solidity
        uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
            add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
            Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
        );
``` 
here it calculates cross chain borrows both 1) collateral in this chain and borrowed token in other chain
2) borrowed token in this chain and collateral in other chain.
which will causes giving Lend tokens twice for same borrowed tokens ( once in this chain and then in that other chain ).

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

protocol gives Lend tokens to same borrowed amount twice ( once in this chain and once in other chain).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change code such that protocol gives lend tokens only once for a borrowed amount in a particular interval.
