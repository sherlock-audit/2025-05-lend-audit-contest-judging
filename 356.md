# Liquidation Reduces Borrower Debt by Entire Seized Amount Rather Than Actual Repay Amount

### Summary

In the cross-chain liquidation flow, the protocol currently reduces the borrower’s debt by the entire seized amount, which includes the repay amount, protocol fees, and liquidator rewards. While the liquidator’s total investment should indeed be deducted by the full seized amount (as it currently is), the borrower’s debt should only be reduced by the actual repay amount, not the entire seized amount. Including fees and rewards in the debt reduction improperly lowers the borrower’s debt beyond what was repaid, effectively negating the intended liquidation penalties.

### Root Cause

The cross-chain liquidation logic conflates the seized amount (which includes repay amount, protocol fees, and liquidator rewards) with the actual repay amount when updating the borrower’s debt. Specifically, the protocol reduces the borrower’s debt by the full seized amount instead of only the repay amount. This happens because the repayment and debt reduction steps reuse the seized amount value without properly separating the components, leading to incorrect debt accounting and under-punishment of the borrower.

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L276) `seizeTokens` are inputted as `payload.amount`. It is correctly used in `_handleLiquidationExecute()`, but it inputs the same amount for the message as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L357). After that it calls `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()` with `payload.amount` (which right now is the seizedAmount) as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L467). It calls `_updateRepaymentState()` with `repayAmountFinal` (which will be the seizedAmount) as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L390). And deducts `userCrossChainCollaterals` with the seized amount. In the end it sends a message to chain A and reduces the `userBorrows` mapping by the seized amount.

### Impact

The borrower’s debt is reduced by an amount larger than it should be, as it includes protocol fees and liquidator rewards in addition to the actual repay amount. This effectively lessens the borrower’s liquidation penalty, allowing them to avoid paying the full economic cost of the liquidation.
