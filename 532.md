# Broken Liquidation Logic::Liquidators not getting their shares of collateral

### Summary

After the success of liquidation check in the `CrossChainRouter.sol` we call specific functions : I am pasting the whole flow here..

HandleRepayment is called inside the `_handleLiquidationSuccess -> repayBorrowInternal ` function of the [CoreRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459)::

```solidity
    function _handleRepayment(address _borrower, address repayer, address _lToken, uint256 repayAmountFinal) private {
        // Execute the repayment
        CoreRouter(coreRouter).repayCrossChainLiquidation(_borrower, repayer, repayAmountFinal, _lToken);
    }
```

which in-turn calls the CoreRouter's crossChainLiquidator repay.


Below is the snippet of the liquidation repayment flow of the CoreRouter

```solidity
    function repayCrossChainLiquidation(address _borrower, address _liquidator, uint256 _amount, address _lToken)
        external
    {
        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
        repayBorrowInternal(_borrower, _liquidator, _amount, _lToken, false);
    }

   function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }

        require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");

        uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

        // Transfer tokens from the liquidator to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);

        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

        // Repay borrowed tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");

        // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }

        // Emit RepaySuccess event
        emit RepaySuccess(borrower, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);
    }
}
```


As we can see we are transferring the debt tokens from the liquidator to the contract , but we are not transferring the share of the underlying collateral tokens back to the liquidator here.

All the state variables are updated which means the repayment is accounted for but the repayer doesn't get the collateral shares/whole collateral back. 

It's a broken repay logic where the liquidator/repayer(who is be the borrower) do not get their repay amount back after they repay the borrowed amount. 



### Root Cause
- Liquidator/Repayer transfers the tokens into the contract but doesn't get their collateral back after liquidation.
- Broken repayment logic , doesn't repay the liquidators/repayer back their shares/respective collateral once the liquidation is done.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- None

### Impact

- The repayer/liquidator doesn't get their share of collateral back.
- Loss of funds for repayer/liquidator.
- Funds will forever be stuck as the repayment is done and the storage variables are updated.
- Broken calculation

### PoC



### Mitigation

- Repay the respective shares of collateral/collateral to the liquidators/repayers. 
- Fix the logic in `CoreRouter::repayBorrowInternal`
