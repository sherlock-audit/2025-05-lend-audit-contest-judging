# Transfer not compatible with USDT/ ETH

## Summary
When redeeming and borrowing of tokens from the protocol by the user , the tokens are transferred using transfer function back to the user, However the transfer function used by the protocol is not compatible with tokens such as Usdt and ETH which are the whitelisted tokens from the protocol.
## Description
```solidity
        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

        // Perform redeem
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
As we can see the protocol tries to execute transfer of underlying tokens which would revert for usdt which expect a boolean and would revert or fail for ETH which is not compatible
## Impact
- Dos of Usdc /usdt and ETH tokens which would lead to stuck assets

## Recommended Mitigation
If the asset is ETH use call and for usdc use Safetransfer
