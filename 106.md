# Users will be unable to execute critical cross-chain functions due to missing payable modifiers

### Summary

Missing payable modifiers in `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain()` will cause denial of service for users as anyone can front-run ETH deposits required for LayerZero messaging fees

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:156` and `CrossChainRouter.sol:172`, the `repayCrossChainBorrow()` and `liquidateCrossChain()` functions lack the `payable` modifier, preventing users from sending ETH directly with their transactions to cover LayerZero messaging fees required for cross-chain operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have insufficient ETH balance to cover LayerZero messaging fees

### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero messaging fees need to be greater than 0 (which is always the case for cross-chain messaging)

### Attack Path

1. **User attempts to call `repayCrossChainBorrow()` or `liquidateCrossChain()`** without the contract having sufficient ETH balance
2. **Transaction reverts** due to `NotEnoughNative` error in `_payNative()` when `_send()` is called
3. **User sends ETH to contract** via separate transaction to fund future calls
4. **Attacker front-runs** the user's intended function call with their own transaction, consuming the ETH balance
5. **User's transaction fails** again due to insufficient balance

### Impact

Users cannot execute critical cross-chain repayment and liquidation functions, leading to denial of service. This prevents borrowers from repaying their debts and liquidators from liquidating underwater positions, potentially causing bad debt accumulation and protocol dysfunction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the `payable` modifier to both functions and modify `_payNative()` to use `msg.value` when available.
