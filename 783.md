# Bad actor can spend the balance of the CrossChainRouter contract

### Summary

`CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain` can be called from anyone and the malicious user has to pay around ~100k gas. But the protocol will suffer more, because of the LayerZero integration.

### Root Cause

The protocol doesnt enforce any crypto-economic restrictions for the user to behave honestly. It just checks [if the balance of the contract is > 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L116). This balance is needed for layer zero cross chain communication.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

User that has no TVL in the protocol can invoke `borrowCrossChain` whatever number of times he wants, incurring only 100k gas on each transaction. If in a loop it can go less on each call.
The protocol will spend more in terms of ETH for layer zero communication (Endpoint handler, execution on the other chain, reverting on the other chain) and will not gain anything from it, just lose value in gas fees.

### Impact

Protocol spends its balance for LayerZero fees without getting new users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change this
`require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");`
with
`require(msg.value > 0, "Out of money");` or bigger number
