# Unchecked transfer return value of the ERC20 would lead to silent failures

### Summary

In the `CoreRouter` at many places we are using `IERC20(token).transfer` which gives a return value back:

```solidity
    // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

The below is a snippet from  OpenZeppelin's `IERC20.sol`:

```solidity
  /**
     * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `to`.
     *
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```


we are not checking the return values of the transfer value.

The token transfer can fail due to a multitude of options which will sail silently due to a lack of transfer  success check.



Instances where this is used:

- [CoreRouter::redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124)

- [CoreRouter::borrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170)

- [CoreRouter::borrowForCrossChain()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L204)

### Root Cause

- Lack of success checks in the transfer call. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- Wrong logic implementation, not an attack.

### Impact

-  Users could lose their funds permanently. 
-  Silent failures of transfer functions.
- High Severity as per sherlock judging guidelines (more than 1% of funds loss) 

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

- The protocol already implements safeTransfer in many places including `CoreRouter`, apply them here too.
