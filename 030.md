# Cross-chain operations lack decimal transformation causing fund loss

## Description:
The LEND protocol performs cross-chain operations without accounting for decimal differences between the same tokens on different blockchains. According to the documentation, the protocol supports tokens like USDT and USDC across multiple chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Sonic, and Monad. However, these tokens have different decimal places on different chains:

USDT/USDC on Ethereum: 6 decimals
[USDT](https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955)/[USDC](https://bscscan.com/token/0x8ac76a51cc950d9822d68b83fe1ad97b32cd580d) on BNB Chain: 18 decimals


The protocol directly uses amounts in cross-chain messages without any decimal transformation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L145
```solidity
// CrossChainRouter.sol
function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
    // _amount is sent directly without decimal transformation
    _send(
        _destEid,
        _amount, // @audit no decimal conversion
        0,
        collateral,
        msg.sender,
        destLToken,
        address(0),
        _borrowToken,
        ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
    );
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L625
```solidity
function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // @audit payload.amount used directly without considering decimal differences
    CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, destUnderlying);
}
```
The protocol also lacks decimal validation when setting up cross-chain token mappings:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L151
```solidity
// LendStorage.sol
function addUnderlyingToDestUnderlying(address underlying, address destUnderlying, uint256 destId)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    // @audit no decimal validation between source and destination tokens
    underlyingToDestUnderlying[underlying][destId] = destUnderlying;
}
```

## Attack path:
1. Scenario 1 - Borrowing from BNB Chain (18 decimals) to Ethereum (6 decimals):
- User on BNB Chain wants to borrow 1000 USDT on Ethereum
- User calls borrowCrossChain(1000 * 1e18, USDT_ADDRESS, ETHEREUM_EID)
- Amount 1000 * 1e18 is sent to Ethereum without transformation
- On Ethereum, this is interpreted as 1000 * 1e18 units of 6-decimal USDT
- User receives 1,000,000,000,000 USDT instead of 1000 USDT (1 trillion times more)
2. Scenario 2 - Borrowing from Ethereum (6 decimals) to BNB Chain (18 decimals):
- User on Ethereum wants to borrow 1000 USDT on BNB Chain
- User calls borrowCrossChain(1000 * 1e6, USDT_ADDRESS, BNB_EID)
- Amount 1000 * 1e6 is sent to BNB Chain without transformation
- On BNB Chain, this is interpreted as 1000 * 1e6 units of 18-decimal USDT
- User receives 0.000001 USDT instead of 1000 USDT (1 million times less)
3. Exploitation via minimal repayments:
- Attacker borrows large amounts using Scenario 1
- Repays using reverse decimal difference to pay minimal amounts
- Keeps the majority of borrowed funds
4. Similar issues affect:
- Cross-chain repayments via repayCrossChainBorrow
- Cross-chain liquidations via liquidateCrossChain
- All collateral calculations in cross-chain scenarios

## Impact:
Users can lose significant amounts due to decimal misinterpretation
Attackers can exploit decimal differences to borrow massive amounts from BNB Chain or repay tiny amounts to Ethereum
Most cross-chain operations between chains with different decimals will fail or produce incorrect results

## Recommended Mitigation:
Implement decimal transformation system
Add decimal validation in proper functions
