# Liquidations can be performed when total borrow is just slightly under the collateral value

### Summary

Due to reapplying of the borrowed index on `totalBorrows`, a borrow position that is just slightly under it's backing collateral value can be pushed to liquidation due to second application of borrow index changes.

### Root Cause

Same-chain liquidations can be performed by calling [CoreRouter::liquidateBorrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L230-L244). During this process, the call stack executes the following:

```solidity
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
        external
    {
        ...

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);

        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }

    function liquidateBorrowInternal(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address payable borrowedlToken,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal {
        require(
            liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(borrowedlToken, borrower, repayAmount, collateral, borrowed) == 0,
            "Borrow not allowed"
        );
        ...
    }

    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        ...
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =    // @audit: the new borrow index is already applied further up in the call stack
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

            ...
    }
```

With `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()`  above, the new borrow index is applied - but this is wrong because previously in the call stack the passed `borrowed` parameter is actually the updated `totalBorrows` calculated from `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. This function already applies the updated borrow index changes to the returned total borrows, and thus applying the borrow index changes again causes the new calculated `borrowedAmount` to be slightly over the actual borrow value `totalBorrows`. This can push not-yet liquidateable positions with a slight margin of difference to be valued over the collateral, thus forcing them to be liquidateable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User has a position such that `totalBorrows` is very slightly less than his collateral with the updated borrow index calculations.
2. Attacker sees this and realizes the margin is small enough such that reapplying the borrow index on the already borrow index applied `totalBorrows` would push it slightly over the collateral backing.
3. Attacker submits a liquidation and succeeds due the step 2.

### Impact

Forced liquidation of borrows with very small margin of difference with collateral.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the reapplication of the borrow index:

```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        ...
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable

            /* @audit-fix: remove the following lines as the borrow index is already applied and shortfall can be checked with only the require statement
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =    // @audit: the new borrow index is already applied further up in the call stack
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
            */

            // require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");   // @audit-fix: change this
            require(borrowed > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

            ...
    }
```
