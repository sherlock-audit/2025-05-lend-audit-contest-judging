# Cross-chain fee griefing drains protocol funds

### Summary

Attackers can exploit the protocol's cross-chain fee funding mechanism to drain protocol funds through asymmetric cost attacks. By initiating cross-chain borrows from low-cost chains to expensive chains with either insufficient collateral or minimal borrow amounts, attackers force the protocol to pay expensive LayerZero and destination chain fees while only incurring minimal source chain transaction costs.

### Root Cause

The protocol funds all cross-chain messaging fees through ETH balances held in CrossChainRouter contracts on each chain. The [`borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L143-L153) function performs no upfront validation to prevent obviously failing transactions, allowing attackers to trigger expensive cross-chain operations that will inevitably fail and waste protocol resources.

This is especially advantageous to exploit when source chains have low transaction fees (L2s like Base, Arbitrum), while destination chains have high fees (Ethereum mainnet), resulting in a significant cost amplification for attackers.

### Attack Path

**Attack Vector 1: Insufficient Collateral Griefing:**
1. Attacker supplies minimal collateral (few wei) on Base (source chain)
2. Attacker calls `borrowCrossChain()` requesting a large borrow amount on Ethereum (destination)
3. Base transaction costs minimal fees, protocol pays LayerZero fees + Ethereum execution fees
4. Ethereum destination reverts due to insufficient collateral, wasting all protocol fees
5. Attacker repeats attack hundreds of times, draining the protocol's ETH reserves

**Attack Vector 2: Minimal Amount Griefing (More Severe):**
1. Attacker supplies sufficient collateral on the Base
2. Attacker calls `borrowCrossChain()` requesting 1 wei borrow on Ethereum  
3. Base validation passes, protocol pays LZ fees + Ethereum execution fees
4. Ethereum processes successfully, sends confirmation back to Base
5. Protocol pays the second round of LZ fees + Base execution for confirmation
6. **Total protocol cost**: Round-trip cross-chain messaging + Ethereum tx fees vs minimal L2 transaction cost

### Impact

*Economic griefing leading to protocol fund depletion:

1. Extreme cost asymmetry enables cheap attacks against expensive protocol operations
2. Protocol ETH reserves can be drained faster than they can be replenished
3. Legitimate cross-chain operations may fail when the protocol runs out of gas funds
4. Attack becomes more profitable during network congestion when fees spike
5. Minimal amount attacks are particularly severe as they trigger round-trip messaging
6. No rate limiting or cost controls prevent sustained griefing campaigns

The attack exploits the massive fee disparity between L2 chains and Ethereum mainnet, where attackers pay minimal L2 fees while forcing the protocol to cover expensive mainnet operations.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

1. Implement user fee payment for cross-chain operations or introduce minimum borrow amounts before initiating expensive cross-chain messaging.
2. Add validation to prevent obviously wasteful transactions
