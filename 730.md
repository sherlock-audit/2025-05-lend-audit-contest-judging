# Incorrect number of seized collateral during liquidation

### Attack Path

During liquidation, the `liquidateBorrowInternal()` function will be executed. In Line 272, it will call the `repayBorrowInternal()` function, which will call the `LErc20.repayBorrow()` function internally, to repay the debt. 

An important note to remember here is that after a repayment, the exchange rate will change on the next call to `exchangeRateStored()`. This is because repayment increases the protocolâ€™s cash (the underlying token balance) and decreases the total borrows, both of which are used in the exchange rate calculation.

Next, in Line 275 below, it will call the `liquidateSeizeUpdate()` function. Within the `liquidateSeizeUpdate()`, the first line of code attempts to compute the number of collateral assets that the liquidator is entitled to based on the `repayAmount` (Amount that the liquidator helps to clear the debt).

File: CoreRouter.sol
256:     function liquidateBorrowInternal(
257:         address liquidator,
258:         address borrower,
259:         uint256 repayAmount,
260:         address lTokenCollateral,
261:         address payable borrowedlToken,
262:         uint256 collateral,
263:         uint256 borrowed
264:     ) internal {
265:         require(
266:             liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(borrowedlToken, borrower, repayAmount, collateral, borrowed) == 0,
267:             "Borrow not allowed"
268:         );
269:         require(borrower != liquidator, "Liquidator cannot be borrower");
270:         require(repayAmount > 0, "Repay amount not zero");
271: 
272:         repayBorrowInternal(borrower, liquidator, repayAmount, borrowedlToken, true);
273: 
274:         // Liquidation logic for same chain
275:         liquidateSeizeUpdate(msg.sender, borrower, lTokenCollateral, borrowedlToken, repayAmount);
276:     }
```

Here is the main bug/issue or root cause. The `liquidateSeizeUpdate()` function computes the number of collateral assets that the liquidator is entitled to based on the new, updated exchange rate after repayment occurs, which is incorrect.

When the repayment is executed, it is, in fact, based on the previous or old exchange rate. Thus, using the new, updated exchange rate will result in an incorrect number of collateral assets being returned to the liquidator. As a result, the liquidator might receive more or fewer collateral assets than expected, which also means that either the protocol or the liquidator will make a loss in either outcome.

```solidity
File: CoreRouter.sol
278:     function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
279:         address sender,
280:         address borrower,
281:         address lTokenCollateral,
282:         address borrowedlToken,
283:         uint256 repayAmount
284:     ) internal {
285:         (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
286:             .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
287:         require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");
```

### Impact

Due to this bug, the liquidator might receive more or fewer collateral assets than expected, which also means that either the protocol or the liquidator will make a loss in either outcome.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Compute the `seizeTokens` by calling the `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens()` function before the repayment is executed. In this case, it will use the same correct rate used during the repayment.
