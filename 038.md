# Attacker will drain LEND tokens from CoreRouter

### Summary

A missing reset of `lendAccrued` in CoreRouter’s `claimLend` will cause repeated full payouts of the same accrued LEND for any holder, allowing an attacker to drain all LEND balances held in the router.


### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol (in [`claimLend`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L370)) the contract reads `lendAccrued[user]`, calls `grantLendInternal(user, accrued)`, but **never writes back** the leftover (or zero) into `lendAccrued[user]`. The mapping therefore retains the entire accrued amount and can be claimed again and again.

```solidity
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
            uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
            if (accrued > 0) {
                grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
            }
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The CoreRouter contract holds a positive balance of LEND tokens (e.g. from prior `lendtroller.claimLend(address(this))`).  
2. At least one holder address has `lendAccrued[holder] > 0` in LendStorage (due to prior supply/borrow activity and distribution).  


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path


1. **Preparation**: Attacker supplies or borrows in at least one market so that on distribution they accrue some LEND.  
2. **Seed Router**: Attacker (or anyone) calls `CoreRouter.claimLend([attacker], [markets], true, true)`.  
   - Router pulls LEND from the Comptroller into its own balance.  
   - Router updates `lendAccrued[attacker]` via `distributeSupplierLend`/`distributeBorrowerLend`.  
   - Router loops over `lendAccrued`, reads `accrued`, and calls `grantLendInternal(attacker, accrued)`.  
   - **Crucially**, `lendAccrued[attacker]` is _not_ set back to zero.  
3. **Drain**: Attacker calls `CoreRouter.claimLend` again (and again).  
   - Each call repeats the same loop, reads the unchanged `lendAccrued[attacker]`, and `grantLendInternal` pays out that amount again.  
4. **Complete Drain**: By repeating, attacker drains the entire LEND token balance held by the router.


### Impact

The protocol’s LEND reserves (held in CoreRouter) can be completely drained.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

After calling `grantLendInternal(user, accrued)`, immediately update storage so that `lendAccrued[user]` becomes the leftover amount (usually zero). For example:

1. Add to **LendStorage** (onlyAuthorized):
   ```solidity
   function setLendAccrued(address user, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorized {
       lendAccrued[user] = amount;
   }
   ```
2. In **CoreRouter.claimLend**, replace the payout loop with:
```diff
       for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
           address user = holders[j];
           uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(user);
           if (accrued > 0) {
-              grantLendInternal(user, accrued);
+              uint256 remaining = grantLendInternal(user, accrued);
+              lendStorage.setLendAccrued(user, remaining);
           }
           unchecked { ++j; }
       }
```
This ensures each user can only claim each accrued amount once, preventing replay‐draining.
