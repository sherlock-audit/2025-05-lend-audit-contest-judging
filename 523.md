# Lack Of EmergencyWithdraw functionality in CoreRouter

### Summary

In the `CoreRouter` we do have a receive() functionality in the [CoreRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L46)


here is the snippet:


```solidity

    constructor(address _lendStorage, address _priceOracle, address _lendtroller) {
        require(_lendStorage != address(0), "Invalid storage address");
        lendStorage = LendStorage(_lendStorage);
        priceOracle = _priceOracle;
        lendtroller = _lendtroller;
    }

    receive() external payable {}




```
to receive any eth sent to the protocol directly or through the fundamental operations.

But  we do lack a `withdrawETH()` functionality in the CoreRouter.

. We do have a `withdrawETH` function in the `CrossChainRouter.sol` controlled by the admin. i.e:

```solidity
    function withdrawEth() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance > 0, "No ETH to withdraw");
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
    }
```



This is a necessary implementation in case any eth is sent to the protocol directly or if any left in the protocol and the protocol wants to withdraw it, there is no way to do it. If the protocol wants to do an emergencyWithdraw for whatever reasons like a hack or something like that or even want to withdraw the eth sent to the protocol directly, They can't.

Also we must implement a `withdrawTokens()` in both the routers controlled by the admin for a safe exit in case of a mishappening.





### Root Cause

- Lack of withdrawETH functionality similar to the CrossChainRouter in the CoreRouter.
- Lack of a emergency exit  in case of a mishap, need of a withdrawTokens functionality too.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- Not an attack, lack of function implementation.

### Impact

- Inability to withdraw eth directly sent to the protocol if there is any left in the protocol.
- In case of a hack or something like that the admin have no ways to withdraw the funds or pause the protocol.
- Lack of functionality to emergency withdraw the tokens and the eth directly sent to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a `WithdrawETH()`  function similar to the one in CrossChainRouter and add a `withdrawTokens()` to both CoreRouter and CrossChainRouter in case a emergency withdraw needs to be done.
