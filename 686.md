# Incorrect calculations of allowed liquidatable amount

### Summary

The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function uses `borrowBalance.amount` (which represents the **principal borrow** without interest) to perform two critical checks:

1. When the market is deprecated, it checks if `repayAmount <= borrowBalance.amount` to permit liquidation.
2. For active markets, it calculates `maxClose` using `borrowBalance.amount` to determine how much the liquidator is allowed to repay based on the close factor.

However, this is incorrect. In both cases, the **actual borrow amount including accrued interest** should be used, not just the principal. As a result, liquidators may be prevented from repaying the correct amount and fully liquidating a position, especially in deprecated markets or when close factor calculations are involved.

```solidity
// Deprecated market check – incorrect comparison
if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
    // @audit-issue: borrowBalance.amount does not include interest
    require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
}

// Active market – incorrect maxClose calculation
uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
    Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}),
    borrowBalance.amount // @audit-issue: does not include interest
);
require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
```

### Root Cause

The function incorrectly uses `borrowBalance.amount` (the principal) instead of calculating the **current borrow amount including interest**, using the borrow index.

This logic flaw occurs in **two places**:
1. When verifying repayment limit for deprecated markets.
2. When calculating `maxClose` in non-deprecated markets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path


1. Bob has a borrow position on a **non-deprecated market**:
   - `borrowBalance.amount = 1,000 USDC` (this is the **principal** stored in storage).
   - Over time, due to interest accrual, his actual borrow becomes **$1,400** (this is the up-to-date borrow amount calculated using indexes).

2. Bob’s position becomes liquidatable because his **collateral drops**, pushing his **LTV above the liquidation threshold**.

3. A liquidator steps in and wants to repay **$700 USDC**, which is **50% of the actual borrow ($1,400)**.

4. However, in the function `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`, the protocol calculates `maxClose` using only the **stored principal** (`borrowBalance.amount = 1,000`) like so:
   ```solidity
   uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
       Exp({mantissa: closeFactorMantissa}),
       borrowBalance.amount
   );
   ```
   Assuming a `closeFactor` of **50%**, `maxClose` is calculated as:
   ```solidity
   maxClose = 50% of 1,000 = 500 USDC
   ```

5. The liquidator is now only allowed to liquidate **up to $500**, even though Bob actually owes **$1,400**, and 50% of that would be **$700**.

6. If the liquidator tries to repay **$700**, the transaction **reverts**:
   ```solidity
   require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
   // 700 <= 500 → false → revert
   ```

7. Consequences:
   - Liquidators are **unable to liquidate the allowed percentage** of the actual debt.
   - Bob's position remains **riskier longer**, since less debt can be cleared per liquidation.

### Impact

1.Liquidators are unable to repay or seize the intended amount due to incorrect calculations.
2.In volatile markets, slower liquidation increases risk of protocol insolvency.

### PoC

No Response


### Mitigation

In both cases, use the actual current borrow amount, including accrued interest. This can be computed as:

```solidity
uint256 actualBorrowAmount = (borrowBalance.amount * currentBorrowIndex) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```

Apply this for:
- Checking repayment allowance in deprecated markets.
- Calculating `maxClose` using the real borrowed amount.

This will ensure liquidations behave correctly and fairly under all circumstances.
