 `LendStorage.lendAccrued`  mapping is used for storing the lendAccrued by particular users (suppliers and borrowers) after they are distributed their lend tokens through distribute function in lendStorage.

we are not resetting the `LendStorage.lendAccrued` for the users after we have granted them their lend tokens from the `ClaimLend -> _grantLendInternal`

 Which means users can claim as much as they want , malicious users can steal others' shares of lend tokens once they are accumulated.

We must reset it to zero once it's done. 

### Root Cause

- Wrong state update logic.
- Doesn't update the lendAccrued after users have claimed their portion of lend.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None, it's a logical error.

### External Pre-conditions

- None, it's a logical error.

### Attack Path

- None, it's a logical error. 

### Impact

- Users' can claim lend infinitely as the logic is not being reset.
-  Malicious users' keep claiming others' portion of the lendRewards.

### PoC

- None

### Mitigation

- Reset the lendAccrued[user] to zero once they have accumulated their portion through the claimLend.
