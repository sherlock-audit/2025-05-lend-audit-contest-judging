# A user can over-borrow on multiple chains by exploiting asynchronous cross-chain borrow requests

### Summary

The protocol allows a user to initiate multiple cross-chain borrows in rapid succession to different destination chains, enabling them to borrow more than their allowed limit against the same collateral due to delayed state synchronization.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is that when a user supplies collateral, the function `lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset` is called to record the supplied asset, but this does not lock or reserve the collateral for pending borrows. There is no mechanism in the `CoreRouter`, `CrossChainRouter`, or `LendStorage `contracts to mark collateral as "pending" or "in use" after a borrow request is initiated. As a result, the protocol does not prevent the user from making multiple `borrowCrossChain `calls in quick succession to different destination chains, each time using the same collateral. Because state updates on the source chain only occur after the destination chain processes the borrow and sends a message back, each destination chain sees the full collateral as available and immediately transfers the borrowed tokens to the user. This allows a user to over-borrow across multiple chains, putting the protocol at risk of insolvency and loss of funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The protocol does not lock or mark collateral as pending after a `borrowCrossChain `call.
- State updates on the source chain only occur after receiving a message back from the destination chain.
- No checks exist to prevent multiple concurrent borrows using the same collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

The user has supplied collateral on one chain.


### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral on Chain A.
2. User quickly calls `borrowCrossChain `to Chain B, Chain C, etc., each time specifying a different destination chain, before any borrow is finalized.
3. Each destination chain receives the borrow request and immediately processes the borrow, sending the requested tokens to the user.
4. The protocol on each destination chain believes the full collateral is available, as the source chainâ€™s state is not yet updated.
5. User receives the borrowed tokens on multiple chains nearly simultaneously, exceeding their allowed borrowing capacity, and can immediately use these assets.

### Impact

Users can borrow on multiple chains using the same collateral, exceeding their allowed borrowing capacity. This can lead to protocol insolvency, loss of funds, and systemic risk across all supported chains.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to lock or mark collateral as pending immediately after a `borrowCrossChain` call, preventing further borrows until the first is finalized.
