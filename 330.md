# `LendStorage`.`borrowWithInterest` calculates interest incorrectly.

### Summary

`crossChainBorrows` stored borrow information that borrowed tokens from other chains.
But `lToken` is not correct for calculating borrowing Index.
So it causes incorrect `borrowWithInterest` value.


### Root Cause

If user borrows, user receives tokens from chain B and `crossChainBorrows` stores borrow information in chain A.
Here user borrows from chain B, so `lToken` of chain B is real index to calculate interest.

```solidity
	if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
		borrowedAmount +=
@>			(borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
	}
```
`LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()` is for same chain borrowing, not cross chain borrowing.
`LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()` is different between chain A and chain B.
So it calculates incorrectly.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

It causes incorrect interest for cross chain borrowing, so repayment/liquidation for cross chain borrowing is affected by this incorrect value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `borrowWithInterest`, doesn't need to calculate `LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()`.
Use `principle` simply.
