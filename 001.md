# Collateral Not Locked Before Debt Finalization

### Summary

Failing to lock collateral on the source chain will cause an undercollateralized debt exposure for the protocol, as borrowers will be able to withdraw or reuse the same collateral before the cross-chain borrow finalizes, enabling them to over-borrow across chains.

### Root Cause

the function only sends a LayerZero message to the destination chain and does not lock, reserve, or mark the collateral as "in use" on the source chain.
The actual debt and collateralization check are performed asynchronously on the destination chain after the message is delivered and processed.

This design allows the user to reuse their collateral before the borrow is finalized, leading to a **race condition**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user must have supplied collateral on the source chain (Chain A).
2. The user must have sufficient collateral to pass the initial check in `borrowCrossChain` function.

### External Pre-conditions

1. There must be sufficient liquidity on the destination chain (Chain B) to fulfill the borrow.

### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral on Chain A.
2. User calls routerA.borrowCrossChain(amount, token, CHAIN_B_ID) to initiate a cross-chain borrow.
3. This only sends a message; no debt is recorded or collateral locked on Chain A at this point.
4. Before the cross-chain message is processed on Chain B, user calls coreRouterA.redeem(lTokenBalance, lTokenA) to withdraw all their collateral from Chain A.
5. The cross-chain message is eventually processed on Chain B, and the user receives the borrowed funds, but their collateral on Chain A is already gone.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a total loss of the borrowed amount as the attacker receives the borrowed funds on Chain B while having already withdrawn all collateral from Chain A.

### PoC

a user supplying collateral, initiating a cross-chain borrow, withdrawing all collateral before the borrow is finalized, and then receiving the borrowed funds on the destination chain.

**The key of this attack is that the cross-chain message is not processed immediately.**

### Mitigation

Lock or reserve the user's collateral on the source chain immediately upon `borrowCrossChain` initiation, preventing withdrawal or reuse until the cross-chain borrow is either finalized or reverted.
