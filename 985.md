# Liquidation failure is incorrectly handled

### Summary

The function `_handleLiquidationFailure` is unable to work because there is no escrowed funds in `CrossChainRouter` contract to send

### Root Cause

The function [`_handleLiquidationFailure()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L478C1-L485C6) is executed on dest chain when the liquidation validation on source chain fails. The function tries to refund the liquidator. But indeed, at this execution step, liquidator has not yet paid any funds (no escrowed funds in the `CrossChainRouter` contract), because funds are settled in the flow of `_handleLiquidationSuccess()`
```solidity
    function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

- Cross chain liquidation does not work as expected, i.e it fails at step `_handleLiquidationFailure()` and it wastes LZ message fees

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider updating the mechanism to handle failure liquidation
