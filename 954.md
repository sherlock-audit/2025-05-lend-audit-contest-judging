# Inefficient Liquidation Due to Close Factor Applied Only to Principal

### Summary

The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function in the lending protocol restricts liquidations based on a close factor applied only to the principal borrowed (borrowBalance.amount), ignoring accrued interest. This leads to inefficient liquidations, allowing undercollateralized debt to persist longer than necessary and increasing bad debt risk.

### Root Cause

* The maxClose calculation uses borrowBalance.amount (principal only) instead of the current debt (principal + interest).

* The closeFactorMantissa is applied to the principal borrowed, not the total owed amount, making liquidations less effective than intended.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The borrower must have a shortfall (borrowedAmount > collateral).

2. The market must not be deprecated (deprecated markets bypass the close factor check).

3. The borrowBalance.amount must be > 0 (i.e., the borrower has outstanding debt).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The borrower’s position must be undercollateralized due to market movements.

### Attack Path


1. Borrower takes out a loan:

* Borrows 100 USDC (principal).

* Accrues 5 USDC in interest (total debt = 105 USDC).

2. Collateral value drops:

* The borrowed value (105 USDC) now exceeds collateral → liquidation possible.

3. maxClose = 50% of 100 = 50 USDC  instead of 50% of 105 = 102.5 USDC


Bad debt accumulates.

### Impact

Increased bad debt due to inefficient liquidations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify maxClose to account for accrued interest
