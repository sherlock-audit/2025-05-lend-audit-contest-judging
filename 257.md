# Inconsistent Interest Handling for Cross-Chain Borrows

### Summary

In the cross-chain borrow flow, when a borrow is updated in `userBorrows` on chain A, the protocol updates the principal and sets the new borrow index but fails to account for accrued interest. This results in understated debt on chain A.

### Root Cause

On chain B, in  `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` the collaterals mapping is updated correctly with interest. On chain A, when a borrow is updated in `userBorrows` via `_handleValidBorrowRequest()`, the protocol adds the borrowed principal but does not account for interest accrued so far. It sets the `borrowIndex` directly without adjusting the principal, causing the stored principal to understate the true borrow amount. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L711). As a result collaterals mapping in chain B is handled correctly, but the borrows mapping in chain A is incorrect and understated.

### Attack Path

A malicious user can exploit the broken interest update logic on Chain A to borrow more than they should be allowed. Here's how:

1. Malicious user already has a borrow and has interest.

2. The user initiates a very small cross-chain borrow (e.g., 1 wei).

3. When the borrow is confirmed on Chain A, the protocol adds only the principal and sets the borrow index to the current one without adding any accrued interest.

4. Now, the borrow record appears as if it includes all interest because its `borrowIndex` matches the current global index.

5. When the user immediately makes a second, large borrow, the protocol calls `borrowWithInterest()`, which assumes the previous borrow was interest-inclusive due to the matching index.

6. As a result, the protocol underestimates the userâ€™s borrow and allows him to borrow more than his investment should permit.

### Impact

1. Users will be able to cross-chain borrow more than they should be able to. This can be exploited using the attack path explained above.

2. Since chain A tracks less debt than chain B, full repayments will underflow revert in chain A, as chain B expects a higher amount than chain A authorizes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that when handling a borrow on Chain A (in `_handleValidBorrowRequest()`), the protocol correctly updates the stored principle to include accrued interest, just like on Chain B.
