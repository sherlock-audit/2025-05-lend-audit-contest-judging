# Missing ETH Balance Check Before Cross-Chain Borrow

## Finding description and impact

The function `borrowCrossChain` does not verify that the contractâ€™s ETH balance (`address(this).balance`) is sufficient to cover the requested borrow amount (`_amount`).

This check is critical when ETH is used as the borrowed asset. Without this validation, the function may attempt to borrow more ETH than the contract holds, leading to failure in downstream logic or potential inconsistencies across chains.

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L154

Root cause:

The current balance check only verifies if the balance is greater than zero:

```solidity
require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");
```

This allows the function to proceed even if `_amount > address(this).balance`, which is unsafe.

Impact:

* Cross-chain borrow calls may fail silently or trigger unexpected behavior on the destination chain
* Can result in failed transfers or state mismatches
* May cause user confusion or funds to be stuck due to partial execution

## mitigation

Replace the balance check with a stricter condition:

```solidity
require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "Insufficient contract balance for borrow");
```

This ensures the contract can fully fulfill the requested borrow amount before proceeding with the cross-chain call.
