# Incorrect Chain ID Usage in `_updateRepaymentState()` Function

### Summary

The `CrossChainRouter` contract contains a critical issue within the `_updateRepaymentState` function, where the `_send()` function is utilized to communicate repayment status across chains. However, the function incorrectly uses the source chain ID (`_srcEid`) instead of the destination chain ID when sending messages. This misconfiguration can result in messages being directed to the wrong chain, leading to failed state updates and potential inconsistencies in the user's borrowing records or transaction failure.



### Root Cause


The `CrossChainRouter` contract includes a function, `repayCrossChainBorrow`, which facilitates the repayment of cross-chain borrows. 

```solidity
    function repayCrossChainBorrow(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _lToken, uint32 _srcEid) external {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(_lToken != address(0), "Invalid lToken address");

        // Pass to internal function for processing
        repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(_borrower, msg.sender, _amount, _lToken, _srcEid);
    }
```

This function calls an internal function, `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal`, to handle the repayment logic. Within this internal function, the `_updateRepaymentState` function is invoked to update the state of the repayment. 

```solidity
    function repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address repayer,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        uint32 _srcEid
    ) internal {
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);
        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        // Get borrow details and validate
        (uint256 borrowedAmount, uint256 index, LendStorage.Borrow memory borrowPosition) =
            _getBorrowDetails(borrower, _token, _lToken, _srcEid);
.
.
        // Update state
        _updateRepaymentState(
@>          borrower, _token, _lToken, borrowPosition, repayAmountFinal, borrowedAmount, index, _srcEid
        );
```
The `_srcEid` is required to calculate the borrow details from `_getBorrowDetails()`,   However, there is a critical issue in the `_updateRepaymentState` function where the `_send()` function is called with the source chain ID (`_srcEid`) instead of the destination chain ID. 

```solidity
    function _updateRepaymentState(
        address borrower,
        address _token,
        address _lToken,
        LendStorage.Borrow memory borrowPosition,
        uint256 repayAmountFinal,
        uint256 borrowedAmount,
        uint256 index,
@>      uint32 _srcEid
    ) private {
.
.
        _send(
@>          _srcEid,
            repayAmountFinal,
            currentBorrowIndex,
            0,
            borrower,
            _lToken,
            _token,
            borrowPosition.srcToken,
            ContractType.DestRepay
        );
    }
```

This misconfiguration can lead to messages being sent to the wrong chain, resulting in failed state updates and potential inconsistencies in the user's borrowing records.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

By sending messages to the incorrect chain, the repayment status may not be accurately updated on the intended chain. This can lead to discrepancies in the user's borrowing records. Additionally, operational disruptions may occur as users encounter issues with incorrect state updates, affecting the overall accuracy and reliability of cross-chain transactions and the cross chain repayment might be failed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this issue, it is crucial to ensure that the correct destination chain ID is used in the` _send()` function within the `_updateRepaymentState` function. This will ensure that messages are sent to the appropriate chain, allowing for accurate state updates.
