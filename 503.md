# Incorrect Interest Accrual in Cross-Chain Borrow Update

### Summary

The `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function in `crossChainRouter.sol` incorrectly updates borrow positions by failing to properly scale the existing principal with the latest borrow index before adding new borrow amounts. This leads to inaccurate debt calculations, allowing users to underpay interest or causing protocol insolvency due to misaccounting.

### Root Cause

The function updates borrow positions by simply adding the new amount to the existing principal without adjusting for accrued interest using the borrow index ratio:

```solidity
userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
```
Instead, it should compute the interest-adjusted principal before adding the new amount:
```solidity
uint256 adjustedPrincipal = (existingBorrow.principle * payload.borrowIndex) / existingBorrow.borrowIndex;
userBorrows[index].principle = adjustedPrincipal + payload.amount;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The function is called when processing a valid cross-chain borrow request.
2. The borrow record already exists (`found == true`).
3. The `borrowIndex` has increased since the last update (indicating accrued interest).

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. **Malicious Borrower Exploits Incorrect Interest Calculation**  
   - A borrower waits until significant interest has accrued (`borrowIndex` has increased).
   - They initiate an additional borrow (`payload.amount`) on the same position.
   - Due to the missing interest scaling, their total debt is undercalculated.
   
2. **Protocol Solvency Risk**  
   - Over time, repeated borrows without proper interest accrual lead to systemic underreporting of debt.
   - The protocol may become undercollateralized if many users exploit this.

### Impact

Borrowers may pay less interest than owed, leading to losses for protocol.
