# Incorrect Invariant Prevents Multi-Chain Cross-Chain Borrowing

### Summary

The `borrowWithInterest` function contains an invariant check `require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated")` that prevents users from having both `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` entries for the same token. This invariant is fundamentally flawed because users can legitimately have multiple cross-chain relationships involving the same token across different chains, where one relationship has the current chain as source and another has it as destination.


### Root Cause

The [`invariant`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L485) incorrectly assumes mutual exclusivity between crossChainBorrows and crossChainCollaterals mappings for any given user and token. However, a user can legitimately have:

Outgoing relationship: Borrow on Chain B using Chain A collateral (recorded in `crossChainBorrows[user][token]` on Chain A)
Incoming relationship: Borrow on Chain A using Chain C collateral (recorded in `crossChainCollaterals[user][token]` on Chain A)

Both relationships involve the same token but are completely independent and valid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have an existing cross-chain borrow relationship where current chain is the source (populating `crossChainBorrows)`
2. User must attempt to create a new cross-chain borrow relationship where current chain is the destination (would populate `crossChainCollaterals)`

### External Pre-conditions

Multiple chains must be operational and connected via LayerZero


### Attack Path

1. User Creates a borrowCrosshain from chainA to chainB
   -  Chain A: crossChainBorrows[user][token] = [borrow1]
   - Chain B: crossChainCollaterals[user][token] = [borrow1]
2. User Creates a borrowCrosshain from chainC to chainA
the code will call trigger `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` in ChainA where we will check the invariant in [`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617) before adding to [`UserCrossChainCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L641)
This mean in the end both `crossChainBorrows[user][token] ` and `crossChainCollaterals[user][token]` on chainA and any operation (redemption/debt repayment) that calls `borrowWithInterest` will revert.

### Impact

users become permanently DOS'd from ALL protocol operations, with their funds locked forever and no possibility of recovery.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the invariant should hold only borrow and debt for the same srcChain and destChain
