# Attacker can cause under-collateralization of the protocol via flash loan attack across source and destination chains

### Summary

The asynchronous nature of cross-chain communication via LayerZero will cause an under-collateralization for the protocol as the attacker can use a flash loan on Chain A to supply collateral, initiate a cross-chain borrow on Chain B, and redeem the collateral on Chain A before the borrow is executed on Chain B. The checks in `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` and `_handleValidBorrowRequest` do not revert because they rely on a snapshot of the collateral sent in the LayerZero message, not the current state after redemption.


### Root Cause

- In [`CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-#L154) the [`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L138-#L139) function call verifies sufficient collateral on Chain A before sending a borrow request to Chain B via LayerZero. However, collateral is not locked during this step, allowing the attacker to redeem it immediately after the check using the redeem function.
- In LendStorage.sol the calculation of withdrawable collateral relies on the `crossChainBorrows` mapping, which is updated asynchronously only after receiving the `ValidBorrowRequest` message from Chain B in `_handleValidBorrowRequest`. This creates a timing window where the collateral can be redeemed before the borrow is accounted for, even though redeem updates `totalInvestment`.
- the collateral check `payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed` uses a snapshot of the collateral from Chain A, not the current state, and `_handleValidBorrowRequest` does not re-verify the collateral, allowing the attack to succeed.







### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker needs to access a flash loan provider on Chain A to acquire a large amount of tokens to use as collateral.
- Attacker needs to supply the flash-loaned tokens to the protocol on Chain A via `CoreRouter::supply` increasing their `totalInvestment` in `LendStorage`.
- The LayerZero message delivery from Chain A to Chain B must have a non-negligible delay (e.g., seconds), allowing the redemption transaction on Chain A to be processed before the borrow is executed on Chain B and before `crossChainBorrows` is updated via `_handleValidBorrowRequest`.


### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker requires a flash loan provider on Chain A with sufficient liquidity to supply the desired collateral amount.

- The LayerZero cross-chain messaging system must introduce a delay (typical for cross-chain communication) between the borrow request on Chain A and the borrow execution on Chain B.



### Attack Path

- Attacker calls a flash loan function on Chain A to borrow a large amount of tokens (e.g., 1,000,000 USDC).

- Attacker calls the supply function on Chain A to deposit the flash-loaned tokens as collateral, increasing their `totalInvestment` and registering the asset in `userSuppliedAssets`.

- Attacker invokes `borrowCrossChain` in `CrossChainRouter` on Chain A, which calls `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to verify sufficient collateral (e.g., 1,000,000 USDC, supporting a 700,000 USDC borrow with a 70% collateral factor). The function passes, and a LayerZero message is sent to Chain B with payload.collateral = 1,000,000,000 USDC.

In the same transaction, before the LayerZero message reaches Chain B, the attacker calls the redeem function on Chain A to withdraw the collateral. The `getMaxWithdrawable` function approves the redemption because `crossChainBorrows` has not yet been updated, as the `ValidBorrowRequest` message from Chain B is still in transit.

The redeem function updates `totalInvestment` to 0 and removes the asset from `userSuppliedAssets`, and the attacker repays the flash loan.

The LayerZero message reaches Chain B, where _lzReceive calls `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`. It verifies payload.collateral (1,000,000 USDC) against totalBorrowed, which passes because payload.collateral reflects the pre-redemption state. The borrow (700,000 USDC) is executed, and `crossChainCollaterals` is updated.

`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` sends a `ValidBorrowRequest` message back to Chain A, which triggers `_handleValidBorrowRequest` to update `crossChainBorrows`. This function does not recheck `totalInvestment`, so it records the borrow despite the collateral being gone, leaving the protocol under-collateralized.



### Impact

- The protocol suffers an approximate loss equal to the borrowed amount on Chain B (e.g., 700,00 USDC), as the collateral on Chain A is no longer available to cover the borrow.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Lock Collateral During Cross-Chain Operations: Modify borrowCrossChain to implement a locking mechanism for collateral on Chain A (e.g., a pendingBorrows mapping or a temporary flag in totalInvestment) when a cross-chain borrow is initiated, preventing redeem from executing until the ValidBorrowRequest message is received and processed.
-  Require a minimum holding period for collateral (e.g., a few blocks) to prevent flash loan-based manipulation, or limit the amount of collateral that can be supplied and redeemed in a single transaction.
