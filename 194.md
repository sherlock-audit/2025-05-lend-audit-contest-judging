# Incorrect Debt Update in _handleValidBorrowRequest Skips Interest Accrual

### Summary

When a user performs a second cross-chain borrow of the same asset, the _handleValidBorrowRequest function on the source chain simply adds the new amount to the previous principle and updates the borrowIndex. However, this ignores the accrued interest between the two borrow events due to the updated index. As a result, the user’s debt is understated, leading to miscalculated total borrow amounts and potential protocol losses.

### Root Cause

When user borrows asset on another chain, _handleValidBorrowRequest is executed on source chain and crossChainBorrows is updated. If a previous borrow exist, it updates the data.

However update logic does not apply interest accrued since the last borrow. If the index has changed (i.e., interest has accrued on the destination chain), the old debt should first be scaled to the new index before the new amount is added. Failing to do this means the debt is not compounded correctly.


```solidity 
    function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {

        if (found) {
            // Update existing borrow
            LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
            userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
            userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
            // Update in storage
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, index, userBorrows[index]);
        } else {
            // Add new borrow record
            lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
                payload.sender,
                payload.srcToken,
                LendStorage.Borrow(
                    srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
                )
            );
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has already borrowed an asset cross-chain and has an existing borrow record.
The destination chain’s borrow index has increased due to time/interest accrual.
The user initiates a second borrow of the same asset on the destination chain.
_handleValidBorrowRequest is called to update the borrow record on the source chain.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user borrows  100 tokens at index 1.1 on different chain→ principle = 100, borrowIndex = 1.1.
2. Time passes, interest accrues → borrow index increases to 1.2.
3. The user borrows another 100 tokens → payload has amount = 100, borrowIndex = 1.2.
4. _handleValidBorrowRequest just adds 100 to the previous 100 and sets index = 1.2.
5. The protocol now sees the user’s total debt as 200, but it should have been:
100 * (1.2 / 1.1) + 100 = ~209.09.
6.  The underreported debt goes unaccounted

### Impact

Debt is underreported, reducing the collateral required or overstating user liquidity.
Allows opening undercollateralized positions





### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the logic to accrue interest on the existing debt before applying the new borrow:
