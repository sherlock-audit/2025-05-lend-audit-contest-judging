# All CrossChain functionality in the CrossChainRouter could be DOSed due its immutable  gas limit

### Summary

Constant GasLimits could put the `CrossChainRouter` in a denial of service state unable to communicate to other Routers in other chain.

### Root Cause

[CrossChainRouter::_send](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L818)
When creating a crosschain message  `layerZero` allows the caller to set the gaslimit(i.e maximum gas to execute the payload in the destination chain).The gas used in a transaction is subject to a lot of factors like  underlying opcode cost and so on. When the opcode gas cost is increased its assumed by the network users to increment their transaction gaslimit. The issue comes into light in a scenario whereby one of the factors that affects the underlying gas spent in a transaction is mutated which triggers and increment the gasCost,but since the gasLimit is fixed the CrossChain request would end up reverting,these would result in Denial of Service for crosschain actions to the corresponding chain.
Since the gaslimit is a constant the CrossChainRouter would have to be deployed again.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Null

### External Pre-conditions

Any of the factor's affecting the destination chain gasCost need's to be mutated in such a way that it  results in a higher gasCost for subsequent transactions.
Likelihood: Honestly low but not impossible

### Attack Path

1.There is a change a Chain B increasing all underlying opcode cost.
2. All subsequent request to Chain B would end up reverting due to the fixed `gaslimit`.

### Impact

 Denial of Service on all CrossChain request to the underlying destination chain.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

//Create a setter to enable the mutation of gasLimit sent or Allow users to set gaslimit for their request.
//Gas limit should be made mutable to model the destination chain network conditions.
//CrossChainRouter.sol 

```solidity

uint256 gasLimit;

function setGasLimit(uint256 _gasLimit)external onlyOwner{
     gasLimit=_gasLimit;
}

  bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(gasLimit, 0);
