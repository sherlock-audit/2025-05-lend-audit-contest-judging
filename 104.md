# Liquidator will drain contract funds by initiating fake cross-chain liquidations on healthy positions

### Summary

The incorrect payment refund in cross-chain liquidation will cause complete loss of contract funds for the protocol as a liquidator will initiate fake liquidations on healthy positions to receive refunds without paying anything.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter::_handleLiquidationFailure()` the function transfers tokens to the liquidator as refund but the liquidator did not initially deposited these tokens, allowing liquidators to receive refunds for liquidations they never paid for.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to hold tokens of any underlying asset in its balance

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **Liquidator calls `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain()`** on Chain B with a large `repayAmount` targeting a borrower with a healthy position, without transferring any tokens to the contract
2. **The liquidation request passes validation** in `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation()` and is sent to Chain A via LayerZero message through `_executeLiquidationCore()`
3. **On Chain A, `CrossChainRouter::_checkLiquidationValid()`** returns false since the position is healthy
4. **`CrossChainRouter::_sendLiquidationFailure()`** sends a failure message back to Chain B
5. **On Chain B, `CrossChainRouter::_handleLiquidationFailure()`** transfers `payload.amount` tokens to the liquidator from the contract's balance without any validation
6. **Liquidator repeats this process** with different amounts and tokens to drain all contract funds

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete loss of all tokens held in the CrossChainRouter contract. The attacker gains all these tokens without providing any payment.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the refund in `CrossChainRouter::_handleLiquidationFailure()` as it is not needed.
