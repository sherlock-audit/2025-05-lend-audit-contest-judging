# Usage of IERC20 transfer method would fail on some tokens due to lack of return of boolean value

### Summary

The `CoreRouter::redeem`, `CoreRouter::borrow`, `CoreRouter::borrowForCrossChain` IERC20 transfer method is used, and will fail when used with some tokens. Most notable and popular example of this is USDT on ethereum mainnet, which lacks a boolean return
value for both of these methods. This means that the solidity call to USDT will revert when attempting to decode
return value. USDT is one of the underlying tokens and it can be borrowed in Lend V2. Additionally, tokens that return false on failure may result in silent fund loss if the return value is not checked properly. 


### Root Cause

In CoreRouter::borrow`  [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170](url)
in `CoreRouter::redeem` [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124](url)
in `CoreRouter::borrowForCrossChain` [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L204](url)

### Mitigation

 Use safeTransfer  from SafeERC20 library instead:
``
`CoreRouter.sol: L124`
```diff
-        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
+       IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
`CoreRouter.sol: L170`
```diff
-       IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
+      IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```
`CoreRouter.sol: L206`
```diff
 -        IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
 +       IERC20(_destUnderlying).safeTransfer(_borrower, _amount);
```
