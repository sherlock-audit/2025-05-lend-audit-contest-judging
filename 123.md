# Incorrect Liquidation Check in `_checkLiquidationValid` May Lead to Unfair Liquidations or Prevention of Valid Liquidations

**Details:**
The `_checkLiquidationValid` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431) within the `CrossChainRouter.sol` contract is invoked on Chain A (the collateral chain) when a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message arrives. Its purpose is to determine if the borrower (`payload.sender`) is liquidatable before seizing their collateral (`payload.destlToken`).

The function calls `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount)`. The critical issue arises because `payload.amount` (which represents `seizeTokens`, the quantity of collateral LTokens to be seized) is passed as the fourth argument, `borrowAmount`.

Within `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, this `borrowAmount` is used to simulate an increase in the borrower's debt as follows:
```solidity
vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, borrowAmount, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);
```

Here, `vars.oraclePrice` is the oracle price of the *underlying token* of `payload.destlToken` (the LToken of the collateral being seized), and `borrowAmount` is `payload.amount` (the quantity of collateral LTokens). The `mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt` function effectively scales this to USD and adds it to the existing debt.

The `_checkLiquidationValid` function then checks if `borrowed > collateral` using the results from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. `collateral` here is the borrower's current total collateral value (adjusted by collateral factors), while `borrowed` becomes `current_total_debt_USD + (quantity_of_collateral_LTokens_to_seize * price_per_underlying_of_collateral_token_USD)`.

This logic is non-standard. A typical liquidation check assesses if a user's current total debt value exceeds their current total collateral value, where the collateral value is adjusted by a liquidation threshold or collateral factor (e.g., `current_total_debt_USD > current_total_collateral_USD_adjusted_by_CFs`). The implemented logic incorrectly inflates the debt side of the comparison by a value derived from the *quantity* of collateral LTokens being seized and the *price of their underlying token*, rather than assessing the borrower's current solvency based on their actual, existing debt and collateral values.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the misuse of the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function within `_checkLiquidationValid`. Specifically, `payload.amount` (the quantity of collateral LTokens to be seized) is passed as the `borrowAmount` argument. The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function then treats this `payload.amount` as if it were a quantity of *underlying tokens* of the collateral type that the borrower is hypothetically borrowing. It calculates the USD value of this hypothetical new debt (`payload.amount` units of the underlying token of the collateral) and adds it to the borrower's existing debt. The liquidation decision is then based on comparing this artificially inflated debt figure against the borrower's current total collateral (CF-adjusted). This is a deviation from standard liquidation logic, which should compare current debt against current CF-adjusted collateral without simulating new debt based on seized collateral quantity.

**Internal Preconditions:**
*   A cross-chain liquidation process is initiated via LayerZero, and a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message (with `payload.contractType == ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute`) arrives at the `CrossChainRouter` contract on Chain A (the collateral chain).
*   The decoded `payload` contains:
    *   `payload.sender`: The address of the borrower whose collateral is on Chain A.
    *   `payload.destlToken`: The address of the collateral LToken on Chain A to be seized.
    *   `payload.amount`: The quantity of `payload.destlToken` (i.e., `seizeTokens`) calculated to be seized.
*   The `lendStorage` contract is correctly set up and contains the borrower's account data.

**External Preconditions:**
*   A liquidator on Chain B has successfully initiated a cross-chain liquidation against a borrower who has collateral on Chain A. This involves calling `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B, which calculates `seizeTokens` and sends the `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message.
*   The price oracle (`priceOracle`) is operational and provides up-to-date prices for the underlying assets of the LTokens.

**Attacker Path (Illustrative of System's Flawed Logic):**
This describes how the system's flawed logic, rather than a malicious actor's direct manipulation beyond initiating a standard liquidation, leads to incorrect outcomes.

1.  **Scenario: Allowing Invalid Liquidation of a Solvent User**
    *   A borrower has an account on Chain A that is currently solvent according to standard DeFi metrics (i.e., `currentTotalDebtUSD <= currentTotalCollateralUSD_CF_adjusted`).
    *   A liquidator on Chain B initiates a cross-chain liquidation against this borrower. The `seizeTokens` (`payload.amount`) value is calculated.
    *   The `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message arrives on Chain A, triggering `_checkLiquidationValid(payload)`.
    *   Inside `_checkLiquidationValid`, `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is called. It calculates:
        *   `borrowed_hypothetical = currentTotalDebtUSD + (payload.amount * price_of_underlying_of_collateral_LToken_USD)`
        *   `collateral_actual = currentTotalCollateralUSD_CF_adjusted`
    *   If `payload.amount * price_of_underlying_of_collateral_LToken_USD` is sufficiently large (e.g., `payload.amount` is large, or the price of the collateral's underlying token is high), it's possible for `borrowed_hypothetical > collateral_actual` to be true, even if the user was initially solvent.
    *   `_checkLiquidationValid` returns `true`.
    *   `_handleLiquidationExecute` is called, and the solvent borrower's collateral is unfairly seized.

2.  **Scenario: Preventing Valid Liquidation of an Insolvent User**
    *   A borrower has an account on Chain A that is insolvent and should be liquidated (i.e., `currentTotalDebtUSD > currentTotalCollateralUSD_CF_adjusted`).
    *   A liquidator on Chain B initiates a cross-chain liquidation. The `seizeTokens` (`payload.amount`) value is calculated.
    *   The `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message arrives on Chain A, triggering `_checkLiquidationValid(payload)`.
    *   `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calculates `borrowed_hypothetical` and `collateral_actual` as above.
    *   If `payload.amount * price_of_underlying_of_collateral_LToken_USD` is relatively small, it's possible for `borrowed_hypothetical > collateral_actual` to be false, even if the user was actually insolvent.
    *   `_checkLiquidationValid` returns `false`.
    *   `_sendLiquidationFailure` is called, and the rightful liquidation of the insolvent borrower is incorrectly prevented.

**Impact:**
The flawed logic in `_checkLiquidationValid` can have significant negative consequences:

1.  **Unfair Liquidation of Solvent Users:** Healthy borrowers who are not truly underwater according to standard DeFi criteria might be liquidated if the calculated `payload.amount` (seizeTokens quantity) is large enough to tip the flawed calculation. This leads to users losing their collateral unjustly.
2.  **Prevention of Valid Liquidations:** Insolvent borrowers who should be liquidated might escape liquidation if the `payload.amount` is small, causing the flawed check to pass them as healthy. This can lead to the accumulation of bad debt within the protocol, risking its overall financial stability.
3.  **Erosion of Trust:** Incorrect liquidations or failure to liquidate when necessary can erode user trust in the protocol's fairness and reliability.

This vulnerability fundamentally misrepresents the borrower's actual risk profile at the point of liquidation, affecting the core safety mechanism of the lending platform. This is unlike the same-chain liquidation logic in `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`, which correctly uses `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, ..., 0, 0)` to assess the current state.
