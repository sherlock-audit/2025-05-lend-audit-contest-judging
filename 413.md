# User can block liquidation by adding many supplied + borrowed assets

### Summary

This is possible due to the functionality of [`LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385-L467) function. As seen in the following block of code, the function gets 2 arrays, one being the `suppliedAssets` array and the other being the `borrowedAssets` array. The problem here is that those arrays get iterated through every time the following functions are called: `CoreRouter::supply`, `CoreRouter::redeem`, `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrow`
If the user get a big borrow and then supply small amount of every possible token and redeem small amount of the corresponding tokens, there is a possibility of the liquidation reverting, leading to bad debt

### Root Cause

The absence of restriction about the number of assets a user can borrow/supply 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

User get a big borrow, supply and borrow all of the possible tokens in the system to fill the arrays. Then if his position become eligible for liquidation through price drop, it can be liquidated because of the filled arrays

### Attack Path

1. User makes a market prediction and borrows when an asset is high on value
2. Then supplies and borrows small amounts of all the possible tokens in the system 
3. After that when the price drops and the position becomes eligible for liquidation, it can't happen because of the filled arrays

### Impact

Liquidation DOS

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add a restriction on how many assets can be borrowed/supplied at the same time
