# Cross-chain accounting will corrupt borrow calculations for protocol users as borrowWithInterest() misuses remote borrow metadata

### Summary

The incorrect use of local token data in borrowWithInterest() will cause inaccurate borrow interest calculations for protocol users as the protocol will apply a local borrowIndex() and unit scale to remote-chain borrowedlToken and principle.



### Root Cause

In [LendStorage.sol:491](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504), the borrowWithInterest() function uses a locally passed _lToken to read borrowIndex() and assumes that the principle in Borrow is denominated in the same token. However, this principle is actually based on the borrowedlToken (a token on the destination chain), and may have a different index and unit (decimals, value, etc). The local chain cannot safely evaluate remote debt without unit normalization or the actual remote token.
```solidity
        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
@>                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex; // audited here
                }
            }
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user initiates a cross-chain borrow via CrossChainRouter, triggering addCrossChainBorrow() to save a Borrow record on the source chain.

2. The borrowedlToken field refers to the destination-chain token.

3. The principle is recorded using the destination token's underlying units.

4. The local chain later calls borrowWithInterest() using a local _lToken that doesn't match borrowedlToken.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The underlying token on the destination chain has a different number of decimals or price than the local equivalent (e.g., USDC 6 decimals vs 18).

2. borrowedlToken is not deployed or not readable on the current chain.

### Attack Path

1. User supplies $1000 of collateral on Chain A.

2. User borrows 100 units of USDC on Chain B (18 decimals) via borrowCrossChain().

3. Chain A stores a Borrow with principle = 100e18, borrowedlToken = lUSDC_B, and srcToken = USDC_A.

4. Chain A later calls borrowWithInterest(user, lUSDC_A) during liquidity or reward calculation.

5. Function incorrectly applies lUSDC_A.borrowIndex() to principle, treating 100e18 as if it were in local 6-decimal units.

6. The result is magnified or shrunk, depending on the index and decimals mismatch â€” making liquidity checks and interest calculations wrong.

7. User may appear solvent when they are not, or over-rewarded with LEND tokens.



### Impact

The protocol suffers from corrupted accounting across all chains. Borrowing limits, liquidation logic, and reward distribution become unsafe. The affected parties are:

- Users who borrow or supply collateral cross-chain (inaccurate rewards, unexpected liquidation).

- The protocol and lenders (potential insolvency due to incorrect liquidity assumptions).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refactor borrowWithInterest():

- Use borrowedlToken directly for borrow index (only if available locally).

- Otherwise, store and use the borrowIndex at the time of borrow + remote borrow snapshot.

- Normalize principle to a canonical unit (e.g., USD) using oracle pricing before comparison or summation.

- Update all downstream consumers (getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(), reward calculations, etc.) to respect normalized units.
