# # Flawed Logic in Borrow Function's Secondary Liquidity Check

### Summary

The incorrect scaling of global borrowed value with market-specific borrow index will cause legitimate borrowing requests to be rejected for borrowers with healthy positions as the borrow function's secondary check miscalculates the user's debt position.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol:157-161](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157-L161) the secondary liquidity check incorrectly scales the global borrowed value with a market-specific borrow index ratio:

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

The `borrowed` value returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` represents the user's global debt position across all markets, already accounting for interest. This value should not be scaled by any borrow index ratio, as it's already properly adjusted for interest.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has supplied collateral to the protocol
2. The user's stored borrow index for a market is lower than the current market borrow index (this happens naturally over time as interest accrues)
3. The user has a healthy position (total collateral > total borrowed)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user supplies collateral to the protocol
2. Time passes and the borrow index increases (due to interest accrual)
3. The user attempts to borrow assets within their collateral limit
4. The borrow function's first check with `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` correctly determines the user has sufficient collateral
5. The secondary check incorrectly scales the global borrowed value by the market's borrow index ratio
6. The borrow is rejected with "Insufficient collateral" despite the user having sufficient collateral

### Impact

1. Users with healthy positions are unable to borrow assets they should be entitled to, causing denial of service
2. As time passes and borrow indices grow, the issue becomes more severe
3. In some scenarios with specific index values, the reverse could also occur where borrowers with insufficient collateral might be allowed to borrow

### Test Output:

```Solidity
Current borrow index: 2000000000000000000
User's stored borrow index: 1000000000000000000

Healthy scenario check:
Total borrowed value: 50000000000000000000
Total collateral value: 75000000000000000000
Is user's position healthy?  true

Flawed secondary check calculation:
Secondary check value: 100000000000000000000
Passes secondary check?  false

ISSUE CONFIRMED: The user's position is healthy (collateral > borrowed),
but the secondary check incorrectly rejects the borrow because
it's scaling the global borrowed value by the borrow index ratio.

Correct market-specific check (if that was intended):
Market borrow with interest: 20000000000000000000
```

### Mitigation

The secondary check should be removed completely, as the initial check with `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is already correctly determining if the user has sufficient collateral
