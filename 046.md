# wrong check in coreRouter::Borrow function allows users to borrow even if they don't have sufficient collateral

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L161
```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);


        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);


        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;


        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
borrowAmount =0 if user didn't borrow this asset previously as currentBorrow.borrowIndex =0 ,so he can borrow even if there is no sufficient collateral is backing as collateral >=0 is true.
and if he previously borrowed this token then also this current formula is not correctly indicating borrowed amount so we should not use it.
LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function calculates the value of collateral and borrowed assets(considering current redeemed or borrowed tokens too).
so here we should use this check,
```solidity
 require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
to check weather sufficient collateral is there to back the borrowed assets.
but here code mistakenly uses borrowAmount in place of borrowed.

### Root Cause

using borrowAmount in place of borrowed, in below lines of code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L161
```solidity
        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

user borrowing from coreRouter::borrow

### Impact

user can borrow assets with out sufficient collateral backing it.As  borrowAmount =0 if previously he didn't borrowed this asset and collateral>=0 is true even if sufficient collateral is not backing it .and in some cases wrong borrowAmount is used in place of actual borrowed amount (borrowed) in this check,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L161
```solidity
        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
so this check was not correct.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use  borrowed in place of borrowAmount , in below lines of code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L161
```solidity
        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
like this 
```solidity
 require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
we can delete this lines of code ,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157-L159
```solidity
        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
```
