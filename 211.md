# liquidateBorrow did not put lTokenCollateral on the liquidator's supply list.

### Summary

The CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow function allows a liquidator to repay a portion of a borrower's debt if the borrower's account is undercollateralized (for same-chain borrows). In return, the liquidator is entitled to seize a calculated amount of the borrower's collateral, typically at a discount, as an incentive.
However, during the liquidation process, lTokenCollateral was not added to the liquidator's supply queue (using the function addUserSuppliedAsset). Because after liquidation, this part of the collateral has become the collateral of the liquidator, and should be included when using getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral to calculate the collateral value. However, due to the current logic missing, the total collateral value calculated by the liquidator will be lower than the correct value.

### Root Cause

liquidateBorrow did not put lTokenCollateral on the liquidator's supply list.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. When liquidator A attempts to repay token X for borrower B and obtain collateral Y. 
2. At the same time, liquidator A previously had no collateral Y (i.e. used supply deposit Y).
3. After the liquidation is completed, collateral Y is not included in the supply list of liquidator A.
4. Liquidator A is liquidated because the collateral value calculated by getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral is less than the correct value.

### Impact

For liquidators, the lTokenCollateral  will not be included in the supply list, causing the collateral value calculated by getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral is less than the correct value, which leads to the risk of liquidation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call addUserSuppliedAsset(liquidator, lTokenCollateral) during the liquidation process.
