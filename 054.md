# Stale Borrow Index in Liquidity Check Enables Redeem, Over-Borrowing

### Summary

Failure to update borrow interest for all borrowed markets will cause incorrect account liquidity calculation for the protocol as a user will redeem or borrow using outdated borrow data, leading to under-collateralization or blocked liquidations.

### Root Cause

The redeem , liquidateBorrow and borrow functions rely on getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral to validate the user's collateral versus borrow balances. This function calls borrowWithInterestSame, which calculates borrow amounts using the stored borrowIndex from lendStorage.
However:
- The borrow indices are not updated for all borrowed markets before checking liquidity.
- Only the LToken involved in the current borrow() call is updated via accrueInterest().
- The redeem() function does not call accrueInterest() at all, meaning all borrow amounts are calculated using stale borrow indices.

```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
...
}


 function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(... ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        address[] memory suppliedAssets = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
        address[] memory borrowedAssets = userBorrowedAssets[account].values();

        // First loop: Calculate collateral value from supplied assets
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length;) {
           ...
}
        // Second loop: Calculate borrow value from borrowed assets
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length;) {
            LToken asset = LToken(borrowedAssets[i]);

          //@audit only one ltoken interest updated
            uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));
...
        }
}


    function borrowWithInterestSame(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 borrowIndex = borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].borrowIndex;
        uint256 borrowBalanceSameChain = borrowIndex != 0
            ? (borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex())) / borrowIndex
            : 0;
        return borrowBalanceSameChain;
    }

### Internal Pre-conditions

[User needs to borrow] tokens from multiple lTokens, e.g., lTokenA, lTokenB
[User needs to call] borrow() or redeem() involving only one lToken, e.g., lTokenA, leaving interest on lTokenB unaccrued
[Borrowed market] must have accrued interest over time such that actual debt is higher than stored values

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

- A user borrows from multiple lTokens, e.g., lTokenA and lTokenB
- The user waits until substantial interest accrues on lTokenB
- The user calls redeem() or borrow() using lTokenA only
- Since getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() uses stale data (due to lack of interest accrual for lTokenB), the protocol underestimates total debt

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of collateral security and risks bad debt or blocked liquidations.
The attacker can extract more value via borrow or redeem than their actual collateral allows.
Liquidators may fail to liquidate positions that appear solvent due to stale debt values.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before any function relies on getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(), the protocol must accrue interest on all borrowed lTokens for the user
