# Potentially Undercollateralized Loans Can Be Accepted

### Summary

The protocol calculates (in `CrossChainRouter`) collateral sufficiency for cross-chain borrows on the source chain (Chain A), but due to the asynchronous nature of cross-chain messaging, the value of the collateral may decrease before the borrow is processed on the destination chain (Chain B). This can result in undercollateralized loans being accepted.

### Root Cause

Collateral checks are performed on Chain A using current price data, but there is a time delay before the borrow is executed on Chain B. If the price of the collateral asset drops during this delay, the collateral may no longer be sufficient, but the borrow will still be processed based on outdated information.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The protocol allows users to initiate cross-chain borrows.
- Collateral sufficiency is checked and included in the LayerZero message sent from Chain A to Chain B.
- The borrow is executed on Chain B based on the collateral value calculated on Chain A.

### External Pre-conditions

- There is a delay between the initiation of the borrow on Chain A and its execution on Chain B.
- The price of the collateral asset is volatile and can change significantly during this delay.

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a cross-chain borrow with just enough collateral on Chain A.
2. The protocol checks and confirms collateral sufficiency and sends a message to Chain B.
3. Before the message is processed on Chain B, the price of the collateral asset drops.
4. The borrow is executed on Chain B using the outdated collateral value, resulting in an undercollateralized loan.
   
For example borrowing 1000 USDC with 0.5 ETH ($1000), but ETH drops to $1500 (so 0.5 ETH = $750) before processing, passing an outdated check.

### Impact

- The protocol may accept and process undercollateralized loans.
- This increases the risk of bad debt and insolvency for the protocol.
- Attackers or opportunistic users could exploit price volatility to borrow more than their collateral is worth.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Re-validate collateral sufficiency on the destination chain (Chain B) using up-to-date price data before executing the borrow.
- Implement a time-weighted oracles or price guards to reject transactions if the price has moved significantly since the original check.
- Introduce a buffer or require over-collateralization to account for potential price slippage during cross-chain message delays.
