# Unchecked arithmetic in updateTotalInvestment may cause accounting overflow under high volume use

### Summary

The use of unchecked addition in updateTotalInvestment can cause an overflow in total investment tracking, resulting in incorrect accounting for users. This issue may occur when high-volume or long-term usage causes accumulated balances to exceed uint256 limits.



### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol, the supply function updates a user‚Äôs total investment after minting lTokens:

Here, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) and mintTokens are added together without explicit overflow checks. If the combined value exceeds uint256 limits (e.g., due to long-term compounding or unusually high asset prices), the arithmetic will revert in Solidity 0.8.x or wrap in older versions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1Ô∏è‚É£ The user consistently supplies assets over a long period, leading to high totalInvestment values.
2Ô∏è‚É£ A legitimate, large supply operation occurs, potentially with a high _amount.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The lToken‚Äôs exchangeRateStored() value increases significantly (which naturally happens over time as interest accrues), making mintTokens larger than when the protocol started.



### External Pre-conditions

1Ô∏è‚É£ The underlying token appreciates over time or the protocol sees significant growth, causing large scale legitimate supply operations.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The protocol has a high volume of users, increasing total supply and thus large numbers being handled by updateTotalInvestment.

### Attack Path

üìà A long-term, active user has supplied tokens for years and accumulated a large balance. Over time, the underlying token‚Äôs exchange rate has appreciated, increasing the amount of mintTokens received for each supply.

When the user performs a large legitimate supply (e.g., re-supplying rewards or large assets after appreciation), the arithmetic:

totalInvestment = previousTotal + mintTokens
could exceed uint256 limits, causing:

A revert (if using Solidity 0.8.x) that denies the transaction, blocking legitimate operations.

Silent wrapping (in older Solidity versions or unchecked blocks), corrupting the user‚Äôs balance and rewards tracking.

### Impact

Affected Party: Users supplying assets, and the protocol‚Äôs internal accounting system.

Impact:

A legitimate supply operation may revert, preventing the user from increasing their stake.

In rare cases (older compiler or unchecked contexts), the system might record an incorrect totalInvestment value, breaking reward calculations, accounting, and liquidations.

These errors could lead to discrepancies in user balances and potentially unfair distribution of rewards or inaccurate liquidation assessments.

### PoC


// Long-term user accumulates 10^77 tokens over time
uint256 prev = lendStorage.totalInvestment(user, token);  // e.g., 10^77
uint256 mintTokens = 10^77;  // High exchange rate over time + large supply amount

// Legitimate user action:
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(user, token, prev + mintTokens);
// Fails with revert or wraps to incorrect value

### Mitigation

Use Solidity 0.8.x‚Äôs built-in overflow checks, or explicitly add SafeMath/checked arithmetic for critical accounting logic.
