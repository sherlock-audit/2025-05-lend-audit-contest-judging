# Incorrect `maxClose` in `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function

### Summary

In `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function of `CoreRouter.sol`, `maxClose` is calculated with `borrowBalance.amount`.\
This calculation is incorrect since `borrowBalance.amount` is used instead of `borrowed`.

### Root Cause

In `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function of `CoreRouter.sol`, `maxClose` is calculated with `borrowBalance.amount`:
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // Determine borrowIndex and borrowAmount based on chain type
@>      LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

        // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
        } else {
            ...

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
@>          uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
@>              Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
            );

            require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
        }

        return 0;
    }
```
`borrowBalance.amount` is outdated value that does not reflect the current borrow index.

There is similar logic with `maxClose` in `liquidateBorrowAllowed` function of [`Lendtroller.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/Lendtroller.sol#L518C1-L555C6).\
Looking into this function, you can easily notice that correct `maxClose` is calculated with `LToken.borrowBalanceStored`:
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowed(
        address lTokenBorrowed,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external view override returns (uint256) {
        // Shh - currently unused
        liquidator;

        if (!markets[lTokenBorrowed].isListed || !markets[lTokenCollateral].isListed) {
            return uint256(Error.MARKET_NOT_LISTED);
        }

@>      uint256 borrowBalance = LToken(lTokenBorrowed).borrowBalanceStored(borrower);

        /* allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated */
        if (isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance >= repayAmount, "Can not repay more than the total borrow");
        } else {
            ...

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
@>          uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(Exp({mantissa: closeFactorMantissa}), borrowBalance);
            if (repayAmount > maxClose) {
                return uint256(Error.TOO_MUCH_REPAY);
            }
        }
        return uint256(Error.NO_ERROR);
    }
```
And looking into `borrowBalanceStored` and `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` function of `LToken.sol`, `borrowBalanceStored` returns the principal increased  with `borrowIndex`:
```solidity
    function borrowBalanceStored(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return borrowBalanceStoredInternal(account);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Return the borrow balance of account based on stored data
     * @param account The address whose balance should be calculated
     * @return (error code, the calculated balance or 0 if error code is non-zero)
     */
    function borrowBalanceStoredInternal(address account) internal view returns (uint256) {
        /* Get borrowBalance and borrowIndex */
        BorrowSnapshot storage borrowSnapshot = accountBorrows[account];

        /* If borrowBalance = 0 then borrowIndex is likely also 0.
         * Rather than failing the calculation with a division by 0, we immediately return 0 in this case.
         */
        if (borrowSnapshot.principal == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        /* Calculate new borrow balance using the interest index:
         *  recentBorrowBalance = borrower.borrowBalance * market.borrowIndex / borrower.borrowIndex
         */
        uint256 principalTimesIndex = borrowSnapshot.principal * borrowIndex;
        return principalTimesIndex / borrowSnapshot.interestIndex;
    }
```

Finally, we can notice that `maxClose` in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, is smaller than correct value which should be calculated with increased `borrowBalance`.

### Impact

In `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, incorrect `maxClose` is used in check of `repayAmount <= maxClose`.\
Considering that the current value is less than real value, there could be incorrect revert when `current_maxClose < repayAmount <= real_maxClose`.

This means that correct `liquidateBorrow` function call could revert - for example, fully repay is DoSed.

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Use `borrowBalanceStored ` in `maxClose` calculation instead of `borrowBalance.amount`:

```diff
--   uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(Exp({mantissa: closeFactorMantissa}), borrowBalance.amount);
++   uint256 borrowBalanceStored = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);
++   uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(Exp({mantissa: closeFactorMantissa}), borrowed);
     if (repayAmount > maxClose) {
		return uint256(Error.TOO_MUCH_REPAY);
     }
```
