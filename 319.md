# Non compliance with ERC20 specification



### Summary
According to the readme.md the contract will be integrating with the USDT token. USDT returns false if the transfer fails but the contract will not notice because the return type is not checked. Checking the return type is a requirement as written in the ERC-20 specification.

`Callers MUST handle false from returns(bool success). Callers must not assume that false never returned`

### Root Cause
The contract uses the `.transfer()` function on an ERC-20 token (USDT) without checking the boolean return value that indicates the success or failure of the transfer.


### Internal Pre-conditions
- The contract interacts with a USDT contract that correctly implements the ERC-20 standard, including returning false on transfer failure.
### External Pre-conditions
A transfer of USDT fails due to various reasons such as insufficient allowance or insufficient balance on the sender's account.


### Impact
protocol won't know when a USDT transaction fails


### Mitigation
Use safeTransfer() instead of transfer or check return type on transfer.
