# Missing Repayment Capping Validation

## Finding description and impact

The function `repayBorrowInternal` allows users to repay a borrowed amount using the `_amount` parameter. When `_amount` is set to `type(uint256).max`, it correctly caps the repayment to the borrowed amount. However, for all other values of `_amount`, the function does not check whether `_amount` exceeds the actual borrowed amount.

## code snippet:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L480

This omission can lead to:

* Over-repayment by users, locking excess tokens in the contract
* Incorrect accounting if the underlying protocol does not handle over-repayments cleanly
* Confusion or unexpected behavior for integrators or users relying on exact balances

Root cause:

The logic:

```solidity
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```

Does not validate that `_amount <= borrowedAmount` when `_amount` is not `type(uint256).max`. A commented-out line shows an earlier consideration of proper capping, but it is currently inactive.

## mitigation

Update the logic to cap the repayment amount to the borrowed amount in all cases:

```solidity
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount >= borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```

Alternatively, revert if `_amount > borrowedAmount` to enforce strict input validation:

```solidity
require(_amount <= borrowedAmount, "Repayment exceeds borrowed amount");
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount;
```

This prevents over-repayment and ensures consistent accounting and user expectations.
