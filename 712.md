# Incorrect `borrowAmount` calculation is done in `CoreRouter.borrow` function

### Summary

There is unnecessary and incorrect `borrowAmount` calculation in `CoreRouter.borrow` function.


### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.borrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L159) function, `borrowed` is calculated from `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function:

```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

@>      (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
@>          lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

@>      uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
@>          ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
        ...
    }
```

However, `borrowed` calculated from `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function, includes all interest with all borrowed tokens and also new borrow amount(`_amount`).

Furthermore, incorrect `borrowAmount` is used instead of `borrowed`.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Incorrect `borrowAmount` is used instead of `borrowed`. This leads to unexpected results.

For example, incorrectly increased `borrowAmount` than `borrowed` leads to unexpected revert due to `collateral < borrowAmount`.

Or when the borrowing with `_token` is the first chance, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is 0 and this means that `borrowAmount` is 0.
If `borrowAmount` is 0, with no collateral (`borrowAmount` and `collateral` are all 0 and this passes `require(collateral >= borrowAmount`), borrowing is possible and this leads to fund loss.


### PoC

### Mitigation

Remove incorrect `borrowAmount` calculation and use `borrowed` instead of `borrowAmount`.
