### Attack Path

The `_checkLiquidationValid()` will be called when handling cross-chain liquidation, as shown in Line 773 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L773

```solidity
File: CrossChainRouter.sol
742:     function _lzReceive(
..SNIP..
772:         } else if (cType == ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute) {
773:             if (_checkLiquidationValid(payload)) {
774:                 _handleLiquidationExecute(payload, srcEid);
775:             } else {
776:                 _sendLiquidationFailure(payload, srcEid);
777:             }
```

The `payload.amount` in the `_checkLiquidationValid()` function below contains the number of seized collateral from the liquidation. Noted that the last parameter (`borrowAmount`) of the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function is set to `payload.amount`. Note that this is incorrect.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431

```solidity
File: CrossChainRouter.sol
428:     /**
429:      * Checked on chain A (source chain), as that's where the collateral exists.
430:      */
431:     function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
432:         (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
433:             payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
434:         );
435:         return borrowed > collateral;
436:     }
437: 
```

The `borrowAmount` parameter of the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function will ADD the effect of new borrowing. 

However, the purpose of the `_checkLiquidationValid()` function is to check whether the liquidation is allowed, and there is no borrowing of assets involved. Thus, it is incorrect to set the `borrowAmount` parameter to `payload.amount` (which is the seized collateral amount). Instead, the  `borrowAmount` parameter should be set to zero (0)

The side-effect of this issue is that it will cause the `borrowed` value returned from the `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to be larger than expected, since the `payload.amount` is added to the `borrowed` value when it should not be. Thus, user's debt will be inflated, leading to healthy user account being prematurely liquidated and their collateral assets being seized (loss of assets)

386:         address account,
387:         LToken lTokenModify,
388:         uint256 redeemTokens,
389:         uint256 borrowAmount
390:     ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
391:         AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars;
..SNIP..

459:             // Add effect of new borrow
460:             if (borrowAmount > 0) {
461:                 vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects =
462:                     mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, borrowAmount, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);
463:             }
```

### Impact

Loss of assets for the affected users. User's debt will end up being inflated, leading to healthy user account being prematurely liquidated and their collateral assets being seized.
