# Inconsistent Borrow Balance Calculation in CrossChainRouter.sol

### Summary

**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `CrossChainRouter.sol::_prepareLiquidationValues`  
**Description**: The borrow balance calculation in `_prepareLiquidationValues` only considers a specific cross-chain borrow position, ignoring same-chain borrows or additional cross-chain borrows of the same asset. This leads to an inaccurate representation of the borrower's total debt, potentially causing premature or unfair liquidations.

### Root Cause

Imagine a user has borrowed USDC from a lending protocol in a few different ways (some directly, some cross-chain). Now, their loan is risky and needs to be partially repaid by a liquidator.

1.  **The Goal:** The protocol has a rule (the "close factor," say 50%) that decides the maximum amount of USDC a liquidator can repay at once. This maximum should be 50% of the user's *total* USDC debt.

2.  **The Problem Function:** A function called `_prepareLiquidationValues` is responsible for calculating this maximum repayable amount (`maxLiquidation`).

3.  **The Flaw:**
    * To calculate `maxLiquidation`, the function first figures out the current value of the user's USDC debt (`currentBorrow`).
    * However, it seems to use information (`params.borrowPrinciple`) that only looks at *one specific piece* of the user's total USDC debt (e.g., just one of their cross-chain USDC loans), instead of adding up *all* their USDC debts.
    * So, the `currentBorrow` value it calculates is only for that single piece of the debt, not the user's total USDC debt.

4.  **The Consequence:**
    * Because the function uses this smaller, partial debt amount to calculate `maxLiquidation`, the resulting `maxLiquidation` is also smaller than it should be.
    * For example, if the user owes a total of 1000 USDC, `maxLiquidation` should be 500 USDC (50% of 1000). But if the function only sees a piece of the debt worth 200 USDC, it will incorrectly calculate `maxLiquidation` as 100 USDC (50% of 200).

**In a nutshell:** The function `_prepareLiquidationValues` incorrectly calculates the maximum amount a liquidator can repay because it looks at only a part of the user's debt for a specific asset, instead of their total debt for that asset. This makes liquidations less effective because liquidators can't repay as much as the protocol intends in one go, which can slow down the process of managing risky loans.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  **Fragmented Borrower Debt:**
    * The borrower must have an outstanding debt in the specific asset being liquidated (`params.borrowedlToken`'s underlying) that is composed of multiple distinct records or "legs."
    * Crucially, the `params.borrowPrinciple` and `params.storedBorrowIndex` (which are inputs to `_prepareLiquidationValues`) must represent the principal and index of *only one* of these debt components, not the sum total.
    * *Example:* A borrower owes a total of 1000 USDC. This could be 600 USDC from a specific cross-chain borrow (this 600 is `params.borrowPrinciple`) and another 400 USDC from a same-chain borrow (or a different cross-chain borrow of USDC).

2.  **Active `closeFactorMantissa`:**
    * The `lendtroller` contract must have a `closeFactorMantissa` configured (e.g., 0.5 for 50%). This factor is used to calculate `maxLiquidation` based on the `currentBorrow`.

### External Pre-conditions

1.  **Borrower Eligibility for Liquidation:**
    * The borrower's overall account health (total value of all their debts versus total value of all their collateral, considering collateral factors and liquidation thresholds) must be such that they are actually eligible for liquidation. The `_prepareLiquidationValues` function itself doesn't check this; it assumes the decision to proceed with trying to liquidate is already valid.

2.  **Liquidator Action:**
    * An external entity (a liquidator) must initiate a liquidation transaction.
    * This transaction would specify the `borrower`, the `borrowedAsset` to repay, and the `lTokenCollateral` to seize. These inputs would lead the system to identify the specific `params.borrowPrinciple` associated with that borrower/borrowed asset/collateral pair.


### Attack Path

- **Borrower (Bob)**:
  - Cross-chain borrow: 1,000 USDC on Chain B, secured by lDAI collateral on Chain A.
  - Same-chain borrow: 500 USDC on Chain B, secured by separate collateral on Chain B.
- **Current Behavior**: `_prepareLiquidationValues` calculates `currentBorrow = 1,000 USDC`, ignoring the additional 500 USDC same-chain borrow.
- **Total Debt**: Bob’s actual debt is 1,500 USDC, but the function only sees 1,000 USDC.
- **Liquidation**: A liquidator (Dave) can repay 400 USDC (based on the close factor applied to 1,000 USDC) and seize collateral from Chain A, even if Bob’s overall position (considering total collateral) might still be healthy.


### Impact

 * **Reduced Liquidation Efficiency:** If `maxLiquidation` is calculated based on a partial debt amount, it will be smaller than what the protocol's `closeFactor` intends to allow. For example, if total current USDC debt is 1500, `closeFactor` is 0.5, then `maxLiquidation` should be 750. But if `params.borrowPrinciple` leads to a `currentBorrow` of only 1000 for the targeted leg, `maxLiquidation` would be incorrectly calculated as 500.
    * **Slower Deleveraging of Risky Positions:** Liquidators can only chip away at the debt in smaller amounts than intended. This can be problematic if a position is significantly underwater, requiring more transactions and potentially making liquidation uneconomical if the allowed `repayAmount` becomes too small.
    * **Potential for Stagnant Bad Debt:** If liquidation is inefficient, bad debt might accrue or persist longer than necessary, impacting protocol health.
    * **Inconsistent Application of `closeFactor`:** The `closeFactor` rule is not being applied consistently to the borrower's total liability in the asset being liquidated.


### PoC

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability using a simplified version of the `CrossChainRouter` contract in Solidity. It simulates a borrower with both cross-chain and same-chain borrows and shows how the liquidation calculation ignores the total debt.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

contract LTokenMock {
    uint256 public borrowIndex;
    constructor() {
        borrowIndex = 1e18; // Initial borrow index (1.0)
    }
    function accrueInterest() external {
        borrowIndex = borrowIndex * 11 / 10; // Simulate 10% interest accrual
    }
}

contract CrossChainRouterPoC {
    LTokenMock public borrowedlToken;
    uint256 public constant CLOSE_FACTOR = 4e17; // 40%

    struct LiquidationParams {
        address borrowedlToken;
        uint256 borrowPrinciple;
        uint256 storedBorrowIndex;
        address borrower;
        uint256 repayAmount;
    }

    // Simulated storage for borrow balances
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public crossChainBorrows;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public sameChainBorrows;

    constructor(address _borrowedlToken) {
        borrowedlToken = LTokenMock(_borrowedlToken);
    }

    // Simulate setting up borrows
    function setupBorrows(address borrower, uint256 crossChainAmount, uint256 sameChainAmount) external {
        crossChainBorrows[borrower][address(borrowedlToken)] = crossChainAmount;
        sameChainBorrows[borrower][address(borrowedlToken)] = sameChainAmount;
    }

    // Vulnerable liquidation function
    function executeLiquidation(LiquidationParams memory params) external {
        uint256 maxLiquidation = prepareLiquidationValues(params);
        require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidation, "Exceeds max liquidation");
        // Simulate liquidation logic (not implemented for brevity)
    }

    function prepareLiquidationValues(LiquidationParams memory params) private returns (uint256) {
        borrowedlToken.accrueInterest();
        uint256 currentBorrowIndex = borrowedlToken.borrowIndex();
        
        // Only considers specific cross-chain borrow position
        uint256 currentBorrow = (params.borrowPrinciple * currentBorrowIndex) / params.storedBorrowIndex;
        
        // Calculate max liquidation amount (vulnerable: ignores total debt)
        return (currentBorrow * CLOSE_FACTOR) / 1e18;
    }

    // Helper function to simulate total debt (for comparison)
    function getTotalBorrow(address borrower) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 crossChainDebt = crossChainBorrows[borrower][address(borrowedlToken)];
        uint256 sameChainDebt = sameChainBorrows[borrower][address(borrowedlToken)];
        return crossChainDebt + sameChainDebt;
    }
}

contract PoCTest {
    CrossChainRouterPoC public router;
    LTokenMock public lToken;

    constructor() {
        lToken = new LTokenMock();
        router = new CrossChainRouterPoC(address(lToken));
    }

    function testVulnerability() external {
        address bob = address(0x1);
        
        // Setup: Bob borrows 1,000 USDC cross-chain and 500 USDC same-chain
        router.setupBorrows(bob, 1000e18, 500e18);

        // Liquidation params for cross-chain borrow only
        CrossChainRouterPoC.LiquidationParams memory params = CrossChainRouterPoC.LiquidationParams({
            borrowedlToken: address(lToken),
            borrowPrinciple: 1000e18, // Cross-chain borrow principal
            storedBorrowIndex: 1e18,  // Initial borrow index
            borrower: bob,
            repayAmount: 440e18       // Attempt to repay 440 USDC (after interest)
        });

        // Execute liquidation (should succeed based on partial debt)
        router.executeLiquidation(params);

        // Check total debt (for reference)
        uint256 totalDebt = router.getTotalBorrow(bob);
        assert(totalDebt == 1500e18); // Total debt is 1,500 USDC, but liquidation only saw 1,000 USDC
    }
}
```

#### Running the PoC
1. Deploy the `PoCTest` contract.
2. Call `testVulnerability()` to simulate the scenario:
   - Bob has 1,000 USDC cross-chain and 500 USDC same-chain borrows.
   - After interest accrual (10%), the cross-chain borrow becomes 1,100 USDC.
   - `maxLiquidation` is calculated as 40% of 1,100 USDC = 440 USDC.
   - Liquidation succeeds for 440 USDC, ignoring the total debt of 1,500 USDC.

This demonstrates that the liquidation proceeds based on an incomplete debt assessment, potentially allowing premature liquidation.


### Mitigation


To fix this vulnerability, modify `_prepareLiquidationValues` to calculate the borrower’s total debt across all borrow positions for the same asset, ensuring liquidation reflects the overall health of the borrower’s position.

#### Proposed Fix
```solidity
function _prepareLiquidationValues(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params)
    private
    returns (uint256 maxLiquidation)
{
    LTokenInterface(params.borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();
    uint256 currentBorrowIndex = LTokenInterface(params.borrowedlToken).borrowIndex();

    // Calculate total borrow balance for the borrower
    uint256 totalBorrow = getTotalBorrowBalance(params.borrower, params.borrowedlToken);
    
    maxLiquidation = mul_ScalarTruncate(
        Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), totalBorrow
    );

    return maxLiquidation;
}

function getTotalBorrowBalance(address borrower, address borrowedlToken) private view returns (uint256) {
    // Sum all borrow balances (cross-chain and same-chain) for the asset
    uint256 totalBorrow = 0;
    // Add logic to retrieve and sum all borrow positions from lendStorage
    // Example: totalBorrow += lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, borrowedlToken);
    return totalBorrow;
}
```
