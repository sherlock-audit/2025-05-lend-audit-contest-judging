# Liquidator may under-liquidate positions due to `maxClose` using incompletely accrued balance for same-chain borrows

### Summary

In the `CoreRouter.sol` contract, the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L329) calculates the `maxClose` amount, which represents the maximum portion of a borrower's debt for a specific `lTokenBorrowed` that can be repaid by a liquidator in a single transaction. This calculation currently uses `borrowBalance.amount`.

The `borrowBalance.amount` (obtained via `lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed)`) reflects the borrower's total debt (principal plus any interest accrued up to their last interaction, such as a borrow or repay) for that specific market *at the time of that last interaction*. It does not include the interest that has accrued on this balance *since* that last interaction up to the current moment of liquidation.

If significant interest has accrued since the borrower's last interaction with the `lTokenBorrowed` market, `borrowBalance.amount` will be notably lower than the actual current outstanding debt for that market. Consequently, `maxClose`, which is calculated as `closeFactorMantissa * borrowBalance.amount`, will be artificially small.

A similar issue exists for deprecated markets within the same function. The check `require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow")` also uses this `borrowBalance.amount`. If `repayAmount` is intended to be the full current debt (principal + all accrued interest), this check might incorrectly fail if substantial interest has accrued since `borrowBalance.amount` was last updated, preventing full repayment.

The correct value to base `maxClose` on would be the current total outstanding debt for `lTokenBorrowed`, including all accrued interest up to the moment of liquidation. This value is correctly calculated by functions like `lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lTokenBorrowed)`.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the use of `borrowBalance.amount` for calculating `maxClose` in `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`. `borrowBalance.amount` does not represent the real-time total outstanding debt (principal + all currently accrued interest) for the `lTokenBorrowed`.

Relevant code snippet from `CoreRouter.sol#liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`:
```solidity
// ...
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);
// ...
// For non-deprecated markets:
uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
    Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount // Uses borrowBalance.amount
);
require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");

// For deprecated markets:
if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
    require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow"); // Uses borrowBalance.amount
}
// ...
```
The `borrowBalance.amount` only reflects the debt principal and interest accrued up to the point of the borrower's last interaction (e.g., `borrow()` or `repayBorrow()`) with that specific market. Interest accrued since that point is not included in `borrowBalance.amount` itself.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A borrower has an active same-chain loan in a specific `lTokenBorrowed` market.
2.  The borrower has not interacted (borrowed more from, or repaid to) this specific `lTokenBorrowed` market for a period, allowing interest to accrue.
3.  The `borrowBalance.amount` stored for the user reflects a past state of their debt for that market, while the actual current debt (including newly accrued interest) is higher.
4.  The borrower's overall account becomes undercollateralized and eligible for liquidation.

### External Pre-conditions

1.  A liquidator initiates a liquidation transaction against the borrower for the `lTokenBorrowed`.
2.  The interest rate model for `lTokenBorrowed` results in positive interest accrual over time.

### Attack Path

1.  Alice borrows 1,000 units of an asset (e.g., DAI) via `CoreRouter`. At this point, for the DAI market, `lendStorage` records `borrowBalance.amount = 1000` and `borrowBalance.borrowIndex = I_initial` for Alice.
2.  Significant time passes. Alice does not make any further borrows or repayments in the DAI market. The DAI market's global `borrowIndex` increases from `I_initial` to `I_current` due to interest accrual. Alice's actual current DAI debt is now `(1000 * I_current) / I_initial`. For example, if `I_current` is `1.5 * I_initial`, her current debt is 1,500 DAI.
3.  Alice's overall collateral value drops, or her total debt rises, making her account eligible for liquidation.
4.  Bob, a liquidator, attempts to liquidate Alice's DAI debt.
5.  Inside `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`, `borrowBalance.amount` for Alice in the DAI market is fetched as 1,000 DAI (the value at Alice's last interaction).
6.  If the market is not deprecated, `maxClose` is calculated. Assuming `closeFactorMantissa` is 50% (0.5e18), `maxClose` becomes `0.5 * 1000 = 500 DAI`.
7.  Bob is only allowed to repay up to 500 DAI of Alice's debt in this transaction. However, based on her actual current debt of 1,500 DAI, a 50% close factor should allow repaying `0.5 * 1500 = 750 DAI`.
8.  If the market is deprecated, and Bob attempts to repay the full 1,500 DAI, the check `require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow")` becomes `require(1000 >= 1500, ...)`, which fails, preventing full liquidation.


### Impact

1.  **Ineffective Liquidations:** Liquidators are restricted to repaying a smaller portion of the debt than intended by the `closeFactor` because `maxClose` is based on an outdated balance. This makes liquidations less efficient at restoring the health of an undercollateralized position.
2.  **Increased Protocol Risk:** If unhealthy debt cannot be sufficiently reduced in a timely manner, the protocol is exposed to a higher risk of accumulating bad debt, especially during periods of high market volatility.
3.  **Reduced Liquidator Incentives:** Liquidators might find the process less profitable or more cumbersome if they need to perform multiple transactions to liquidate a debt that could ideally be handled in fewer, larger steps. This could disincentivize their participation.
4.  **Stranded Debt in Deprecated Markets:** For deprecated markets, the incorrect check may prevent liquidators from repaying the full outstanding debt (including all accrued interest), potentially leaving unrecoverable debt in those markets.
