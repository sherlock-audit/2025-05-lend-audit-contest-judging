# Incorrect Liquidation Eligibility Check in Cross-Chain Lending Protocol

### Summary

An incorrect liquidation eligibility check in the cross-chain lending protocol may allow premature or invalid liquidations. This stems from using a hypothetical account liquidity function with inappropriate parameters, causing the system to simulate a collateral reduction before confirming if liquidation is valid. This logic enable liquidators to seize collateral from borrowers who are not yet undercollateralized.

### Root Cause

The function `_checkLiquidationValid()` uses `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` with the `payload.amount` (representing seized collateral) as a simulated redemption amount:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431

```solidity
(borrowed, collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    payload.sender, 
    LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 
    0, 
    payload.amount // Incorrect: this simulates collateral withdrawal
);
```


This simulates a future state in which the borrower has already lost collateral, making the account appear more undercollateralized than it actually is — leading to potential false positives in liquidation validation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

* A liquidation message is received via `_lzReceive` with `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute`.
* `_checkLiquidationValid()` is invoked to verify the borrower's eligibility for liquidation.
* `payload.amount` is derived from `seizeTokens`, i.e., the amount of collateral intended to be seized.

### External Pre-conditions

* A cross-chain liquidation is initiated by a liquidator on another chain (Chain B).
* The liquidation message is relayed to the borrower’s chain (Chain A).

### Attack Path

1. A liquidator initiates a liquidation on Chain B.
2. The protocol calculates and sends the amount of collateral to be seized (`seizeTokens`) to Chain A.
3. On Chain A, `_checkLiquidationValid()` simulates the borrower's liquidity **after** losing `seizeTokens` worth of collateral.
4. If this simulation shows undercollateralization, liquidation proceeds.
5. The borrower's position may be liquidated **even if they were adequately collateralized before the liquidation message arrived**.

### Impact

* **False Liquidations**: Borrowers may be liquidated while their positions are still healthy.
* **Financial Loss**: Users could lose collateral unfairly due to premature liquidation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, 0)`
