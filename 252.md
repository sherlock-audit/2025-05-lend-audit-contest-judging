# LZ fee paid by the protocol will lead to fee overspending in case of tangible market activity or griefing attack

### Summary

Lend protocol handling cross-chain actions (borrows, lendings, liquidations) via LZ interface, while fee for cross-chain messaging taken from protocol itself.
Paying for LZ fee could lead to a multiple negative sequences:
1)Attacker can intentionaly initiate multiple cross-chain actions that's going to the failure.
2)Under tangible market conditions it's expected a lot of failures will happens itself, as price of assets moves fast 
3)Some user's actions will cost more for protocol than any possible income (adding few wei of collateral, let's say, from Base to ETH mainnet will cost 1.5-2.5$ (as relayer fee 0.1-0.2$+payload execution on mainnet ~2$, + oracles). 
Abusing cost of payload execution (i.e. adding multiple dust collaterals) could increase cost by a lot, as ~ 100k gas in mainnet will cost you around 2.5$ at current gas price)   

### Root Cause

CrossChainRouter.sol
```solidity
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }
```
LZ fee taken from protocol

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Could happens itself or because of griefing attack
Execution of user/attacker cross-chain actions will cost much more in fee as any potential profits
1)user adds multiple dust collateral in Base to Eth
2)it doesn't change anything in protocol income meanwhile LZ's fee will cost few dollars to execute tx

### Impact

Loss of money for protocol, potentially could lead to DoS of any cross-chain actions if router contract's balance drained

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add quotes for users or make them pay the fee
