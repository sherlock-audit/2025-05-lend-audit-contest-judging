# triggerSupplyIndexUpdate after minting will result in a loss of rewards.

### Summary

There is a problem with the current LEND reward distribution mechanism. When users supply new assets to the market, the market's calculation of the previous period's LEND supply index uses the total supply of LTokens after the new LTokens are issued. This causes the new supply to be included in the denominator too early when calculating the reward rate of the previous period's LTokens, resulting in the dilution of rewards for all existing suppliers during that particular reward accumulation period. The amount of new supply will of course not receive rewards from the previous period, but it will be included in the total supply calculation, ultimately resulting in some rewards being lost.

The same problem occurs when borrowing and redeeming.

### Root Cause

triggerSupplyIndexUpdate happens after mint, resulting in reward dilution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. When supply occurs.

### Impact

Reward Dilution for Existing Suppliers: For the specific reward accrual period during which a new supply occurs, all existing suppliers will receive fewer LEND rewards than they would have if the new supply had not influenced the totalSupply used for that period's index calculation.

Lost Rewards: The portion of rewards that is diluted is not distributed to the new supplier. This fraction of rewards, which should have gone to existing suppliers, is effectively not distributed during that specific update cycle because the overall market index increment was reduced.

### PoC

1. Alice has 1,000 LTokens in a specific LToken market. The current LToken.totalSupply() is 1,000.
2. Since the last LEND supply index update for this market, 10 LEND tokens are calculated to have accrued for all suppliers based on deltaBlocks and supplySpeed. Alice's lendSupplierIndex reflects the market index from the last update.
3. Bob calls CoreRouter.supply() to deposit a large amount of the underlying asset, which results in minting 9,000 new LTokens for him.
4. The LToken.mint() function executes, and LToken.totalSupply() becomes 1,000 (Alice) + 9,000 (Bob) = 10,000.
5. LendStorage.distributeSupplierLend() is called for Bob.
6. The ratio (LEND per LToken for the period) is calculated as 10 LEND / 10,000 LTokens = 0.001 LEND/LToken.
7. Alice can only obtain 0.001 * 1,000 = 1 LEND and 90% LEND is lost.

### Mitigation

Modify CoreRouter.supply() so that LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerSupplyIndexUpdate(_lToken) is reliably called and completes before LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) executes.
