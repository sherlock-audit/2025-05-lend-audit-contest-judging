# Incorrect Recipient Address in `borrowCrossChain`

## Summary
The [borrowCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) function in `CrossChainRouter.sol` sends the borrower’s address (`msg.sender`) from chain A to chain B via the `_send` function. In chain B, [_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L581) transfers the borrowed funds to this address, which may be invalid or belong to another party in chain B. As a result, the user in chain A does not receive the borrowed funds but remains liable for repayment, leading to a direct loss of funds.

## Root Cause
In `CrossChainRouter.sol`, `borrowCrossChain` passes `msg.sender` as the `sender` parameter to `_send`:
```solidity
_send(
    _destEid,
    _amount,
    0,
    collateral,
    msg.sender, // Sender address from chain A
    destLend,
    address(0),
    _borrowToken,
    ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
);
```
In chain B, `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` uses this `sender` address to transfer the borrowed funds:
```solidity
IERC20(payload.borrowToken).safeTransfer(payload.sender, payload.amount);
```
Since `msg.sender` from chain A may not be valid or may belong to another user in chain B, the funds are sent to an unintended or unreachable address, while the user in chain A is recorded as the borrower.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports cross-chain borrowing via LayerZero, with `CrossChainRouter.sol` handling messages between chains.
2. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` in chain B uses the `sender` address from the payload to transfer borrowed funds.
3. `lendStorage` tracks cross-chain borrows, holding the user in chain A liable.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A user in chain A calls `borrowCrossChain` to borrow tokens (e.g., USDC) on chain B.
2. The user’s address in chain A is either invalid or owned by another party in chain B.
3. The price oracle and `lendtroller` function correctly to process the borrow request.

## Attack Path
1. **User Initiates Borrow**:
   - User in chain A calls `borrowCrossChain` to borrow 100 USDC on chain B.
2. **Message Sent**:
   - `msg.sender` (user’s address in chain A) is sent to chain B via `_send`.
3. **Funds Transferred**:
   - In chain B, `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` transfers 100 USDC to the `sender` address, which is invalid or belongs to another party.
4. **Loss Incurred**:
   - The user in chain A receives no funds but is liable for repaying 100 USDC.
5. **Exploitation**:
   - If the address is controlled by another party in chain B, they gain 100 USDC, while the user in chain A suffers the loss.

## Impact
- **Direct Fund Loss**: The user in chain A loses the borrowed amount (>1% and >$10), as funds are sent to an unintended address, while remaining liable for repayment (Sherlock Section IV).
- **Protocol Integrity**: The flaw undermines the cross-chain borrowing mechanism, eroding user trust and potentially causing financial disputes.
- **Sherlock Criteria**: The issue occurs in every cross-chain borrow where the user’s address differs across chains, requiring no complex external conditions, aligning with High severity (Section IV).

## Mitigation
Modify `borrowCrossChain` to allow users to specify a recipient address in chain B as an input parameter. Update the code as follows:
```solidity
function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid, address _destRecipient) external payable {
    require(msg.sender != address(0), "Invalid sender");
    require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");
    require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");
    require(_destRecipient != address(0), "Invalid recipient");
    address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_borrowToken);
    require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported source token");
    address destLToken = lendStorage.underlyingToDestLToken(_borrowToken, _destEid);
    require(destLToken != address(0), "Unsupported destination token");
    LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
    lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
    if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)) {
        enterMarkets(_lToken);
    }
    (, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);
    _send(
        _destEid,
        _amount,
        0,
        collateral,
        _destRecipient, // Use specified recipient for chain B
        destLend,
        address(0),
        _borrowToken,
        ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
    );
}
```
This ensures borrowed funds are sent to a user-specified valid address in chain B, preventing loss.
