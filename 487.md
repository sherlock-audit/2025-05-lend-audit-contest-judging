# Cross-chain reallocation to incorrect address due to account abstraction incompatibility

### Summary

The assumption that user addresses are consistent across chains will cause a complete loss of funds for account abstraction (AA) wallet users as the router will forward reallocated tokens to an incorrect address.

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol, cross-chain reallocation functions use msg.sender or parameters like _borrower and _recipient assuming address consistency across chains. However, AA wallets often derive different addresses per chain. This design choice is flawed and leads to the protocol sending funds to an address not controlled by the user on the destination chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user with an account abstraction wallet initiates a cross-chain borrow or collateral operation.
2. The router forwards tokens using an address not valid on the destination chain.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol operates on chains where the same user has different addresses (common in AA wallet designs).
2. The user has not deployed their wallet on the destination chain.

### Attack Path

1. The user initiates a cross-chain borrow or collateral reallocation.
2. The router receives or sends tokens intended for the user’s equivalent address.
3. Tokens are sent to an address the user does not control (different chain address or undeployed AA wallet).
4. Funds are permanently lost.


### Impact

Users with AA wallets suffer a complete loss of reallocated funds. The attacker gains nothing directly, but this results in a high-risk user-side vulnerability.

### Mitigation

Add an explicit _recipient parameter to all cross-chain reallocation calls.
	•	Never assume msg.sender on one chain corresponds to the same user address on another.
	•	Ensure wallet deployment on destination chain before transferring funds or integrate checks with AA providers like Safe.
