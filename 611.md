# USDT Transfers Will Fail Due To No Boolean Returned On Mainnet

### Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract uses `IERC20(_token).transfer(...)` to transfer ERC20 tokens, but some tokens like USDT on Ethereum mainnet do not return a boolean value as expected by the IERC20 interface. This can cause the transfer to fail or revert unexpectedly.

### Root Cause

The contract assumes all ERC20 tokens strictly follow the IERC20 standard, which requires the `transfer` function to return a boolean value. However, USDT and some other tokens do not return any value, causing compatibility issues when interacting with them via the standard interface.

Happens in `CoreRouter::redeem`, `CoreRouter::borrow` and `CoreRouter::borrowForCrossChain`

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract attempts to transfer tokens using `IERC20(_token).transfer(...)`.
- The `_token` address points to a non-standard ERC20 token (e.g., USDT mainnet) that does not return a boolean value from `transfer`.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user supplies, borrows, or redeems USDT (or another non-standard ERC20) through the protocol.
- The contract attempts to transfer USDT using the standard IERC20 interface.

### Attack Path

1. User interacts with the protocol using USDT.
2. The contract calls `IERC20(_token).transfer(...)` to transfer USDT.
3. Since USDT does not return a boolean, the call reverts.
4. The transaction fails, potentially locking user funds or breaking protocol functionality.

### Impact

- Users may be unable to redeem, borrow, or receive USDT from the protocol.
- Funds could become stuck in the contract.
- The protocol may become unusable for USDT or similar tokens, impacting user trust and protocol reliability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`, which handle non-standard ERC20 implementations like USDT.
- Replace all direct calls to `IERC20(_token).transfer(...)` with `IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(...)`.
- Ensure all token transfers use the SafeERC20 library to maximize compatibility and safety.
