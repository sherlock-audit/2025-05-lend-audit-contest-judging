# Incorrect ltoken address used in cross-chain liquidation success message causes liquidation failure

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidation, the destination chain initiates the process by sending a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to the source chain.In that message, the `payload.destlToken` will be the source chain's corresponding lToken address, which the destination chain initially determined using:

```solidity
lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid)
```

This mapping converts the destination chain’s lToken address into the appropriate source chain lToken.

After seizing collateral on the source chain, the source chain sends a `LiquidationSuccess` message back. However, it includes the same `payload.destlToken` address in the message, which is the lToken address on the source chain, not the corresponding lToken on the destination chain.

On the destination chain, in `_handleLiquidationSuccess`, the same `payload.destlToken` (which is actually a source chain lToken address) is incorrectly assumed to be the destination lToken. This incorrect address is passed to `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal`, which attempts to perform the repayment on a market that **does not exist** on the destination chain.

This mismatch causes `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` to revert, breaking the liquidation flow.

### Root Cause

- The source chain includes its local lToken address in the `LiquidationSuccess` payload.
- The destination chain does not remap this lToken back to its own local version.
- As a result, repayment is attempted using an invalid lToken that does not exist in the destination chain’s market list.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice has an active borrow on the destination chain (ARB), and her collateral is supplied on the source chain (ETH). Let's say her cUSDC needs to be seized on the source chain Compound market.

2. The destination chain (ARB) initiates cross-chain liquidation. It uses `crossChainLTokenMap` to compute the corresponding cUSDC (lToken) address on the source chain (ETH) and sends it in the `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message.

3. The source chain (ETH) successfully seizes the required amount of cUSDC collateral from Alice and sends back a `LiquidationSuccess` message. However, it mistakenly includes `payload.destlToken = sourceChainCUsdc`, which is the source chain's cUSDC lToken address.

4. Upon receiving this message, the destination chain (ARB) calls:

   repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
       borrower,
       liquidator,
       payload.amount,
       payload.destlToken, // this is incorrectly set to the source chain's cUSDC lToken
       srcEid
   );

5. The `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` function attempts to use this incorrect lToken address (source chain’s cUSDC) to repay the borrow on the destination chain. Since USDC market addresses will be different on source chain and destination chain and no market exists with that address on destination chain, call to repay function on that lToken market contract will revert .
6. As a result, the function reverts, breaking the liquidation flow and causing a denial of service for liquidations.


### Impact

Cross-chain liquidations will be DoSed


### PoC 

No response


### Mitigation

- The source chain must map its lToken address back to the destination chain equivalent before sending the `LiquidationSuccess` message.
- Alternatively, the destination chain should perform the reverse mapping using `lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap` or a dedicated `reverseCrossChainLTokenMap`.
