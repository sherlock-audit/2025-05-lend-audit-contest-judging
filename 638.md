# Cross-Chain Borrow Could Fail

### Summary
In the current implementation, there are both same-chain and cross-chain borrowing processes. During cross-chain borrowing, the borrow request is initiated on chain A (the source chain) where the collateral exists. The user then borrows on chain B (the destination chain), and the transaction is validated on chain A. However, on chain B, the collateral from chain A is compared to the debt borrowed using the collateral of chain B. This inconsistency can prevent some users from successfully executing cross-chain borrowings.

### Root Cause
The root cause is that the collateral of chain A is compared to the debt borrowed using the collateral of chain B, rather than the collateral from chain A.

```solidity

    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        ...
        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );

        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
622:    require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
        ...
    }
```
The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function calculates the total assets of this chain and the total borrowed amount using the collateral (total assets).

Consider the Scenario:
1. Alice has 1000 USDT on chain A and 2000 USDT on chain B.
2. Alice performs a same-chain borrow on chain B for 1200 USDC.
3. Alice attempts a cross-chain borrow on chain B for 500 USDC using the 1000 USDT collateral from chain A.
At this point, payload.collateral = 1000 and totalBorrowed = 1200. Therefore, step 3 fails.

### Impact
The core contract functionality is broken, preventing users from executing cross-chain borrowings.
