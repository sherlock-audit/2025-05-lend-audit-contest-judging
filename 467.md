# wrong debt tracking

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L130

### Summary

In `crossChainRouter.sol`  , the `borrowCrossChain` function is called by uses who want to borrow cross-chain. however doing the collateral tracking call, the current implementation mistakenly calls ` lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);` instead of ` function addCrossChainBorrow(address user, address underlying, Borrow memory newBorrow) external onlyAuthorized {
        crossChainBorrows[user][underlying].push(newBorrow);
    }` which adds the user and underlying in a mapping for proper tracking. 

### Root Cause

the root cause is that the implemation doesnt track cross-chain borrow properly since ` function addCrossChainBorrow(address user, address underlying, Borrow memory newBorrow) external onlyAuthorized {
        crossChainBorrows[user][underlying].push(newBorrow);
    }` isnt called and stored with the needed infomation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

no-comment

### External Pre-conditions

no-comment

### Attack Path

1. user calls cross chain borrow
2. due to the bug, the getBorrowdetails doesnt properly show users crosschain borrow details.

### Impact

1. it affects the calculation of borrowed tokens.
2. wrong tracking of debt

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

call `  function addCrossChainBorrow(address user, address underlying, Borrow memory newBorrow) external onlyAuthorized {
        crossChainBorrows[user][underlying].push(newBorrow);
    }
` during the crosschainborrow funcion
