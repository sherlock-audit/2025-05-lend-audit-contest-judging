# Cross-chain liquidation race

### Summary

A borrower can be liquidated on Chain A even if they become solvent before the liquidation message is processed, or conversely a liquidator can lose their repay funds if prices change mid-flight. By racing an oracle update between the repay on Chain B and the seize on Chain A, an attacker can trigger an out-of-sync validity check, causing wrongful collateral seizure or a “double failure” where debt is repaid but collateral isn’t seized.

### Root Cause

Cross-chain liquidation splits into two steps:

1. Repay on Chain B and send a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message.
2. Seize collateral on Chain A based on that message.

Chain A reads the oracle and checks solvency once before seizing. If the on-chain price moves between the repay step and message handling, the stored “insolvent” snapshot no longer matches reality, but the seize still proceeds (or is wrongly rejected after seize logic in some flows). There is no atomicity or synchronized re-check of borrower liquidity at the moment of seizure.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

A sufficiently large oracles‐driven price change on Chain A can occur between the repay step on Chain B and the liquidation message being processed on Chain A

### Attack Path

1. Borrower collateral is near the collateralization threshold.
2. Liquidator submits `liquidateCrossChain(...)` on Chain B:
- Calls `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` → passes with the old (“insolvent”) price.
- Executes repay on Chain B, then `_send(..., ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute)` to Chain A.
3. Attacker front-runs or otherwise triggers an oracle update on Chain A that raises the price of the collateral asset.
4. When Chain A’s `_lzReceive` for `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` executes:
- It either (depending on timing) uses the old price to seize (wrongly), or
- Sees the borrower as solvent under the new price, sends a failure message after collateral has already been moved.
5. Borrower loses collateral they should have kept, or liquidator loses repaid funds while collateral remains with the borrower.

### Impact

**Direct theft of user collateral:** Legitimate borrowers can lose all deposited collateral despite being solvent under current market conditions.

**Double spend / griefing:** A liquidator’s repayment can succeed on Chain B yet be “reversed” on Chain A, leaving them out-of-pocket without seizing anything (or vice versa).
