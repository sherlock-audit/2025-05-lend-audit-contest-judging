# The collateral value used in the cross-chain borrow flow is stale

### Summary

The collateral value used in the cross-chain borrow flow is stale because it is taken at the time of initiation on the source chain and may become invalid by the time it is processed on the destination chain due to user actions (calling redeem()) during the cross-chain message latency.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain`:

```solidity

function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {

// ... [code omitted for brevity]

// Get current collateral amount for the LayerZero message

(, uint256 collateral) =

lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

// Send message to destination chain with verified sender

_send(

_destEid,

_amount,

0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain

collateral,

msg.sender,

destLToken,

address(0), // liquidator

_borrowToken,

ContractType.BorrowCrossChain

);

}

```

On the destination chain, in `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`:

```solidity

function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {

// ... [code omitted]

// Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount

require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

// ... [code to proceed with borrow]

}

```

**Issue arises**:
- The `borrowCrossChain` function on the source chain takes a snapshot of the user's collateral at the current block.
- This collateral value is sent via LayerZero to the destination chain.
- The destination chain uses this snapshot to validate the collateral.
- However, between the time of the snapshot and the time the message is processed on the destination chain, the user may have withdrawn collateral on the source chain, making the snapshot stale.

### Attack Path

Scenario:
When a user withdraws collateral in the interim, the destination chain’s validation becomes invalid. The collateral value is indeed stale, as it’s fixed at initiation and not updated to reflect changes during message transit.

### Impact

The borrow is approved on the destination chain even though the user no longer has sufficient collateral on the source chain, leading to undercollateralized loans.
