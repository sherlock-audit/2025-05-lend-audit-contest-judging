# Inaccurate return value of function `CrossChainRouter::_payNative()`

### Summary

The Lend-V2 protocol incorporates layerzero for cross chain messaging borrowing and repayment and by extension implements some functions from the LayerZero codebase where one of the function [_payNative](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/142846c3d6d51e3c2a0852c41b4c2b63fcda5a0a/oapp/contracts/oapp/OAppSender.sol#L93-L103) which is designed to return the native fee associated with the message, &#x20;However, when a contract intends to initiate multiple LayerZero messages within a single transaction, more than just `_nativeFee` may be required from the sender to execute such messages..

The contract `CrossChainRouter.sol` uses the LayerZero [_lzSend function](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/142846c3d6d51e3c2a0852c41b4c2b63fcda5a0a/oapp/contracts/oapp/OAppSender.sol#L65-L91) in executing multiple function e.g `CrossChainRouter.LiquidateCrossChain`  `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain` and `CrossChainRouter.repayCrossChainBorrow` each of this function makes call to `_lzSend` function to send messages.. in the current implementation of  `_payNative` it is correctly overridden in the case to return an amount of native tokens greater than just `_nativeFee` but the return value of the function is designed to return just the value of the input ie the `_nativeFee`

   ```solidity
 /**
     * @dev Internal function to pay the native fee associated with the message.
     * @param _nativeFee The native fee to be paid.
     * @return nativeFee The amount of native currency paid.
     *
     * @dev Overridden to use contract balance instead of msg.value.
     */
    function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual override returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
        if (address(this).balance < _nativeFee) {
            revert NotEnoughNative(address(this).balance);
        }
        return _nativeFee;
    }
   ```
 

### Root Cause

In the [CrossChainRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L787-L799) the return value of is set to the `_nativeFee` which breaks if a contracts initiates multiple LayerZero messages in a single transaction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

 User intends to send multiple LZ messages within a single transaction

### Attack Path

1.  User/Contract intends to call multiple function which send multiple layerzero messages within a single transaction.
2. User intends to borrow cross chain and repay cross chain within same transaction in ethereum blockchain which does not use a sequencer and facilitates multiple layerzero messages within a single transaction.
3. User executes calls.
4. As only `_nativeFee` fees is sent the remaining amout `msg.value - _nativeFee` becomes trapped in the `CrossChainRouter` contract

### Impact

The current Implementation of `CrossChainRouter._payNative` only forwards `_nativeFee` across cross chain message The remaining native tokens `(msg.value - _nativeFee)` become trapped in the contract. Due to this certain function will not be able to execute for the user, Since the excess funds are not forwarded to the endpoint, subsequent messages  may silently fail, resulting in incomplete execution

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing the current implementation to return the msg.value sent..

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Internal function to pay the native fee associated with the message.
     * @param _nativeFee The native fee to be paid.
     * @return nativeFee The amount of native currency paid.
     *
     * @dev Overridden to use contract balance instead of msg.value.

    function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual override returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
        if (address(this).balance < _nativeFee) {
            revert NotEnoughNative(address(this).balance);
        }
        return _nativeFee;
    }
