# Liquidation Finalization Fails Due to Mismatched Token/Chain Contexts


### Summary
It is not possible to correctly finalize a cross-chain liquidation on the debt chain (Chain B) after collateral has been successfully seized on the collateral chain (Chain A). The _handleLiquidationSuccess function in CrossChainRouter.sol on Chain B will invariably fail to identify and process the local debt record. This failure stems from using data fields from the LayerZero payload (which originate from Chain A and carry Chain A's specific context for certain token identifiers and amounts) as direct lookup keys for local storage on Chain B, without necessary translation or contextual awareness. Consequently, the borrower's debt remains uncleared despite collateral seizure, breaking the cross-chain liquidation mechanism.
### Vulnerability Detail
The CrossChainRouter contract is designed to manage cross-chain lending operations, including liquidations. When a borrower's collateral on Chain A is seized to cover a debt on Chain B, Chain A's CrossChainRouter sends a LiquidationSuccess message to Chain B's CrossChainRouter. The _handleLiquidationSuccess function on Chain B is then responsible for processing this message and finalizing the debt clearance.
The core of the vulnerability lies in how _handleLiquidationSuccess attempts to locate the relevant debt record within Chain B's LendStorage. It uses lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral, passing parameters derived directly from the incoming payload:
```solidity 
// CrossChainRouter.sol - _handleLiquidationSuccess (on Chain B)
// ...
function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
    // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
    // payload.destlToken is the LToken address of the *collateral seized on Chain A*
    address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

    // Find the specific collateral record
    (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
        payload.sender,     // borrower's address
        underlying,         // Intended: underlying of debt on Chain B. Actual: derived from Chain A's collateral LToken.
        currentEid,         // Intended: srcEid for lookup. Actual: Chain B's EID. Stored srcEid is Chain A's EID.
        0,                  // Intended: destEid for lookup. Actual: 0. Stored destEid is Chain B's EID.
        payload.destlToken, // Intended: LToken of debt on Chain B. Actual: Chain A's collateral LToken.
        payload.srcToken    // Intended: Underlying of collateral on Chain A. Actual: Chain B's borrowed underlying.
    );
    require(found, "Borrow position not found"); // This is where the function will revert

    // ... subsequent logic for repayment (which is never reached) ...
    // uint256 srcEid = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(payload.sender, underlying)[index].srcEid;
    // repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(payload.sender, payload.liquidator, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, srcEid);
}
// ...
```
The crossChainCollaterals mapping in LendStorage.sol on Chain B stores records of debts incurred on Chain B that are collateralized by assets on other chains. These records are created by _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest when a user borrows on Chain B. A typical record would be indexed and contain fields reflecting the context of the borrow on Chain B:
 * Mapping Keys: crossChainCollaterals[borrower_address][underlying_of_asset_borrowed_on_Chain_B]
 * Stored LendStorage.Borrow struct fields:
   * srcEid: The EID of Chain A (where the collateral for this Chain B borrow resides).
   * destEid: The EID of Chain B (where this borrow occurred).
   * borrowedlToken: The LToken address of the asset borrowed on Chain B (e.g., lUSDC_B).
   * srcToken: The underlying token address of the asset backing the collateral on Chain A (e.g., WBTC_A_Underlying).
The parameters passed to findCrossChainCollateral in _handleLiquidationSuccess are mismatched with these stored values:
 * underlying Parameter for findCrossChainCollateral: Derived from lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken). Since payload.destlToken is Chain A's collateral LToken, lTokenToUnderlying on Chain B will likely return address(0) or an unrelated token if no direct mapping exists for foreign LTokens. The stored records are indexed by the underlying of the asset borrowed on Chain B.
 * srcEid Parameter: currentEid (Chain B's EID) is used. The stored record's srcEid is Chain A's EID. The comparison userCollaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid (i.e., EID_Chain_A == EID_Chain_B) will fail.
 * destEid Parameter: 0 is used. The stored record's destEid is Chain B's EID. The comparison userCollaterals[i].destEid == 0 will fail.
 * borrowedlToken Parameter: payload.destlToken (Chain A's collateral LToken) is used. The stored record's borrowedlToken field contains Chain B's borrowed LToken (e.g., lUSDC_B). These are different tokens.
 * srcToken Parameter: payload.srcToken (Chain B's borrowed underlying, e.g., USDC_B_Underlying) is used. The stored record's srcToken field contains Chain A's collateral-backing underlying (e.g., WBTC_A_Underlying). These are different tokens.
These direct and multiple mismatches ensure that lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral will return found = false, leading to an immediate revert due to require(found, "Borrow position not found");.
Attack Path / Scenario (Illustrative Flow of Failure):
This is a protocol logic flaw rather than an exploitable attack for fund theft by a malicious user. It demonstrates the breakdown of a critical protocol function.
 * Setup: A borrower has legitimately taken a cross-chain loan: collateral (e.g., WBTC) on Chain A, debt (e.g., USDC) on Chain B.
 * Liquidation Trigger: The borrower's position becomes undercollateralized. A liquidator initiates liquidateCrossChain on Chain B for the USDC debt, targeting the WBTC collateral on Chain A.
 * Message to Chain A: CrossChainRouter on Chain B sends a CrossChainLiquidationExecute message to Chain A. The payload correctly identifies Chain A's WBTC LToken as the target for seizure.
 * Collateral Seizure on Chain A: Chain A's CrossChainRouter successfully processes this message via _handleLiquidationExecute. It seizes the specified amount of the borrower's WBTC LToken.
 * LiquidationSuccess Message to Chain B: Chain A sends a LiquidationSuccess message back to Chain B. This message's payload includes:
   * payload.destlToken: The address of Chain A's WBTC LToken (collateral that was seized).
   * payload.srcToken: The address of Chain B's USDC underlying (the original debt asset).
   * payload.amount: The quantity of WBTC LTokens seized on Chain A.
 * Processing on Chain B (_handleLiquidationSuccess):
   * Chain B's CrossChainRouter receives the message and calls _handleLiquidationSuccess.
   * The function attempts to use payload.destlToken (Chain A's WBTC LToken) and other payload fields to look up the local USDC debt record in its LendStorage.
 * Lookup Failure: As detailed above, the parameters used in findCrossChainCollateral (Chain A's token contexts, incorrect EID usage) do not match how the Chain B USDC debt record is indexed and defined.
 * Revert: findCrossChainCollateral returns found = false. The require(found, "Borrow position not found"); statement triggers, causing the entire _handleLiquidationSuccess transaction on Chain B to revert.
Outcome: The borrower's WBTC collateral is successfully seized and accounted for on Chain A. However, because _handleLiquidationSuccess reverts on Chain B, the corresponding USDC debt on Chain B is not marked as repaid or reduced. The liquidation process is incomplete, leading to an inconsistent state where the borrower has lost collateral but their debt remains.
### Proof of Concept 
The following Foundry test conceptualizes how this vulnerability would be demonstrated. It focuses on setting up the scenario and triggering the failing call in _handleLiquidationSuccess.
Note: This PoC assumes the ability to set up the initial crossChainCollaterals record. In a real test, this might require calling authorized functions on LendStorage or mocking its state.

Explanation of PoC Logic and How it Demonstrates Failure:
 * Setup (setUp function):
   * Deploys LendStorage, CoreRouter, and CrossChainRouter for a simulated Chain B environment.
   * Deploys mock ERC20 tokens to represent assets on Chain B (usdc_B_Underlying, lUsdc_B_LToken) and to serve as address references for assets on Chain A (wbtc_A_Underlying_Ref, lWbtc_A_LToken_Ref).
   * The key assumption for this PoC to be illustrative is that a crossChainCollaterals record for the borrower (who borrowed usdc_B_Underlying collateralized by wbtc_A_Underlying_Ref from Chain A) already exists in lendStorage_B with the correct fields reflecting Chain B's context. For example, borrowedlToken in storage would be address(lUsdc_B_LToken), and srcEid in storage would be EID_A_COLLATERAL_CHAIN. Actually populating this state in Foundry requires careful use of authorized functions or storage manipulation and is a prerequisite for running this test logic.
 * Test Function (test_Finding3_HandleLiquidationSuccess_FailsDueToMismatchedLookup):
   * payloadFromChainA Construction: This struct is built to precisely mimic the data _handleLiquidationSuccess on Chain B would receive from Chain A after a successful collateral seizure.
     * payloadFromChainA.destlToken is set to address(lWbtc_A_LToken_Ref) (Chain A's collateral LToken).
     * payloadFromChainA.srcToken is set to address(usdc_B_Underlying) (Chain B's borrowed underlying, correctly identifying the debt type from Chain A's perspective).
   * lzReceive Call: The test simulates Chain B's CrossChainRouter receiving this payload from Chain A via LayerZero.
   * Internal Execution in _handleLiquidationSuccess:
     * underlying = lendStorage_B.lTokenToUnderlying(payloadFromChainA.destlToken /* address(lWbtc_A_LToken_Ref) */);
       * Since lWbtc_A_LToken_Ref is a Chain A token reference, lendStorage_B (on Chain B) is unlikely to have a valid mapping for it to a Chain B underlying. underlying will likely become address(0).
     * The subsequent call to lendStorage_B.findCrossChainCollateral(...) uses:
       * underlying: address(0). The actual stored record is indexed by address(usdc_B_Underlying). -> MISMATCH on primary mapping key.
       * srcEid parameter: EID_B_DEBT_CHAIN (from currentEid). The stored record has srcEid = EID_A_COLLATERAL_CHAIN. -> MISMATCH.
       * destEid parameter: 0. The stored record has destEid = EID_B_DEBT_CHAIN. -> MISMATCH.
       * borrowedlToken parameter: address(lWbtc_A_LToken_Ref). The stored record has borrowedlToken = address(lUsdc_B_LToken). -> MISMATCH.
       * srcToken parameter: address(usdc_B_Underlying). The stored record has srcToken = address(wbtc_A_Underlying_Ref). -> MISMATCH.
   * vm.expectRevert: Due to these critical mismatches, findCrossChainCollateral will return found = false. The require(found, "Borrow position not found"); inside _handleLiquidationSuccess will then trigger. The vm.expectRevert(bytes("Borrow position not found")); asserts that this specific revert occurs.
This Foundry PoC structure outlines the necessary steps and variable states to reproduce and verify the identified vulnerability directly within a test environment. The most challenging part of implementing it live is ensuring the prerequisite state of lendStorage_B.crossChainCollaterals is accurately established in the setUp function.
### Impact
High. This flaw breaks the critical functionality of completing cross-chain liquidations on the debt chain. Collateral is seized on Chain A, but the corresponding debt remains outstanding on Chain B. This can lead to:
 * Loss for Borrower: Borrower loses collateral without their debt being cleared.
 * Bad Debt for Protocol: The protocol holds an uncleared debt that was intended to be covered.
 * System Unreliability: The cross-chain liquidation mechanism is fundamentally dysfunctional.
### Recommendation
The _handleLiquidationSuccess function on Chain B needs a significant redesign to correctly process the LiquidationSuccess message:
 * Reliable Debt Record Identification:
   * The lookup for the debt record on Chain B should primarily use information that uniquely and consistently identifies the original cross-chain borrow from Chain B's perspective. This might involve using payload.sender (the borrower) and the EID of Chain A (as the srcEid of the collateral, which Chain B knows from the Origin of the LZ message) and the LToken of the asset borrowed on Chain B (which payload.srcToken correctly identifies the underlying of).
 * Correct Token Contexts for Repayment:
   * The amount of seized collateral (payload.amount of payload.destlToken from Chain A) must be converted into its equivalent value in the borrowed asset on Chain B (e.g., USDC_B). This requires an oracle price lookup on Chain B for both Chain A's collateral asset and Chain B's debt asset.
 * Process Repayment Correctly:
   * All subsequent repayment logic must use Chain B's debt LToken (e.g., lUSDC_B) and the correctly converted repayment amount.
   * Clarify the liquidator's role. If they provide the borrowed asset on Chain B, CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal must pull the correct asset type and amount.
A thorough review of data context and identifiers in LayerZero messages across all stages of cross-chain operations is essential.
