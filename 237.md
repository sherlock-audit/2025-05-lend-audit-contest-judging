# Seized collateral and reward lost via `liquidateCrossChain` when using account abstraction wallets

### Summary

When users utilize account abstraction (AA) wallets, the same user may have different addresses on different chains. As a result, if an AA wallet user performs a cross-chain liquidation via `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B, the seized collateral and rewards will be credited to an address on Chain A that the user does not control, causing permanent loss of their funds.

### Root Cause

The protocol uses LayerZero to execute cross-chain transactions. In liquidateCrossChain, [`msg.sender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L281) from Chain B is used as the liquidator’s address on Chain A. Chain A then receives the message via `_lzReceive` and [`handles`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L321-L346) the liquidation and reward distribution.
Because of account abstraction, users can have different addresses on different chains, which leads to a mismatch during cross-chain operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

User uses an account abstraction wallet.

### Attack Path

Any AA wallet user can unintentionally trigger this issue:
1. Alice supplies collateral on Chain A.
2. Alice becomes undercollateralized.
3. Bob (AA wallet user) executes `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B.
4. Chain A seizes Alice’s collateral and rewards, incorrectly crediting them to Bob’s Chain B address, which Bob cannot access on Chain A, resulting in loss of funds.

### Impact

AA wallet liquidators permanently lose access to seized collateral and rewards, significantly reducing user motivation to participate in cross-chain liquidations and negatively affecting protocol health.

### PoC

Account abstraction wallets have seen rapid adoption, with over 6.4 million users and more than $100 billion in assets.

The image below shows the latest stats from Safe wallet(one of the account abstraction wallets):

With such a large user base, it is highly likely that AA users will perform cross-chain liquidations, making the associated risks too significant to overlook.

Here’s a scenario, assume Bob (an AA wallet user) wants to liquidate Alice on Chain B:

1. Alice supplies 1000 token A as collateral on Chain A (the collateral chain).
2. Alice borrows 500 token B on Chain B using `borrowCrossChain`.
3. The price of token A drops significantly, allowing 400 of Alice’s tokens A to be liquidated.
4. Bob executed `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B (the debt chain)

**Let’s look into the details:**

In `liquidateCrossChain`, the liquidator address is set to `msg.sender`, which is Bob’s address on Chain B:

```solidity
        // Send message to Chain A to execute the seize
        _send(
            params.srcEid,
            seizeTokens,
            params.storedBorrowIndex,
            0,
            params.borrower,
            lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to Chain A version before sending
@>          msg.sender, // as liquidator
            params.borrowedAsset,
            ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
        );
```
This message is then sent to Chain A.

On Chain A `_lzReceive` triggers  `_handleLiquidationExecute`, which uses the payload.liquidator (Bob’s Chain B address) as the recipient of the seized collateral and rewards:


```solidity
@>      lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(payload.destlToken, payload.liquidator); // liquidator
        ...
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
@>          payload.liquidator,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
        );
```

Because Bob is using an account abstraction wallet, his address on Chain A is different. The rewards and seized collateral are therefore sent to an address he cannot access.

Finally, Bob loses 400 Token A and the associated rewards.

### Mitigation

Consider explicitly passing a user-specified liquidator address as a parameter to `liquidateCrossChain`.
