# incorrect calculation of totalBorrowed amount of user

### Summary

if we observe borrowWithInterest function which is used to calculate total cross chain borrows of a user,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L493
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;


        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];


        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
```
here borrows[i].srcEid  will always be destination chains Eid from where we borrowed assets, so borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid is always false.
Due to this borrows from other chains were not added to  borrowedAmount .
so user can borrow new tokens even if he don't have sufficient collateral. 

### Root Cause

use this check  if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid), which is not needed in below lines of code,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L487-L492
```solidity
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

user can borrow new tokens even if he don't has enough collateral because borrowedAmount value will be less than what it should be so collateral >=borrowed check will pass.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

don't use this check  if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid), in below lines of code,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L487-L492
```solidity
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
```
