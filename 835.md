# Incorrect Global Debt Scaling Allows Unfair Liquidation of Solvent Borrowers

### Summary

Incorrectly scaling the total USD value of a borrower's entire debt portfolio by the interest index of only a single borrowed asset will cause an unfair liquidation for solvent borrowers as a liquidator will trigger the `liquidateBorrow` function when the inflated debt amount passes the shortfall check.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L344C13-L350C76

In `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` at the line `borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;`:
The `borrowed` variable represents the **total USD value of the borrower's entire debt across all borrowed assets**, as computed and returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. This calculation incorrectly applies the interest accrual factor (`LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex() / borrowBalance.borrowIndex`) derived from a *single, specific* borrowed asset (`lTokenBorrowed`) to this **aggregate total USD debt value**. This erroneous operation inflates `borrowedAmount` to a value that does not accurately reflect the borrower's true total current debt. The subsequent `require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");` then uses this inaccurately inflated `borrowedAmount` for the shortfall check, leading to liquidations even when the borrower's actual total USD debt is less than or equal to their total USD collateral.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* The borrower needs to have an outstanding loan.
* The borrower needs to have supplied collateral.
* The `lTokenBorrowed` (the asset chosen by the liquidator to be repaid) must have accrued sufficient interest such that its `LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex()` is significantly greater than `borrowBalance.borrowIndex` for that specific borrower. This ensures the `borrowedAmount` calculation will inflate the total debt.
* The borrower's actual total USD debt (as returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` and represented by the `borrowed` parameter) must be less than or equal to their total USD collateral (represented by the `collateral` parameter), meaning they are solvent.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.  A borrower supplies collateral and takes loans in one or more assets. They ensure their total USD collateral value is greater than or equal to their total USD debt value (as reported by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`), making them solvent.
2.  Time passes, and interest accrues on one of the borrowed assets (`borrowedlToken`) that the borrower holds a debt in. This causes its current `borrowIndex()` to become substantially higher than the `borrowIndex` recorded at the borrower's last interaction for that specific asset (`borrowBalance.borrowIndex`).
3.  A liquidator (or an attacker) identifies this condition where the borrower is truly solvent, but the logic in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` would produce an inflated debt value.
4.  The liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow(borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, borrowedAsset)`, specifically choosing the `borrowedAsset` that has experienced the significant interest accrual.
5.  Inside `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()`, the `borrowedAmount` is calculated by taking the *total USD value of all debt* (`borrowed`) and incorrectly multiplying it by the interest accrual factor of `lTokenBorrowed`. This results in `borrowedAmount` becoming an artificially inflated numerical value.
6.  The `require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");` check passes because the inflated `borrowedAmount` is now numerically greater than `collateral` (the actual total USD value of collateral), despite the borrower's true total USD debt being less than their total USD collateral.
7.  The liquidation proceeds, despite the borrower being solvent, unfairly seizing their collateral.

### Impact

The solvent borrowers suffer an approximate loss of their seized collateral. The liquidator gains the seized collateral (minus the protocol's seize share) and the liquidator bonus.

### PoC

Assume all USD values and `borrowIndex` values are scaled by `1e18` for simplicity in calculation, as commonly done in Solidity fixed-point arithmetic.

**1. Borrower's Initial State (Solvent):**
* **Collateral Supplied:** Borrower supplies 0.5 ETH as collateral.
    * Assume 1 ETH = $2000 USD.
    * Therefore, the **total USD value of collateral** (`collateral` parameter received by `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`) = $1000 USD (i.e., `1000 * 1e18`).
* **Debt Borrowed:**
    * Borrower borrows 500 USDC. (Assume 1 USDC = $1 USD).
    * Borrower borrows 1000 units of `LPTOKEN`. (Assume 1 `LPTOKEN` = $0.05 USD).
    * The `borrowBalance.borrowIndex` for `LPTOKEN` (recorded at the time the borrower last interacted with it) = `1.0 * 1e18`.
* **True Total Debt (in USD):** (500 USDC * $1/USDC) + (1000 `LPTOKEN` * $0.05/`LPTOKEN`) = $500 + $50 = $550 USD.
* **Initial Solvency Check:** Borrower's $1000 USD collateral is greater than their $550 USD true total debt. The borrower is **solvent**.

**2. Interest Accrual and Attacker's Observation:**
* Time passes, and significant interest accrues on the `LPTOKEN` asset.
* The `LTokenInterface(LPTOKEN_lToken_address).borrowIndex()` (current global borrow index for `LPTOKEN`) increases to `3.0 * 1e18`.
* A liquidator (attacker) observes this borrower. They know the borrower is truly solvent ($1000 collateral vs $550 debt), but also notice the high interest accrual on `LPTOKEN` which will exploit the faulty logic.

**3. Attacker Initiates Liquidation:**
* The liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow(borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, LPTOKEN_lToken_address)`.
* The function proceeds to call `liquidateBorrowInternal`, which then calls `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` with the following key parameters derived from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`:
    * `collateral` = `1000 * 1e18` (Total USD value of collateral)
    * `borrowed` = `550 * 1e18` (Total USD value of ALL debt)
    * `lTokenBorrowed` = `LPTOKEN_lToken_address`

**4. Flawed Shortfall Calculation within `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`:**
* The problematic line `borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;` is executed:
    * `borrowedAmount = ( (550 * 1e18) * (3.0 * 1e18) ) / (1.0 * 1e18);`
    * `borrowedAmount = 1650 * 1e18;` (This value now represents $1650 USD).

* The critical shortfall check is then performed:
    * `require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");`
    * `require( (1650 * 1e18) > (1000 * 1e18), "Insufficient shortfall");`

**5. Outcome:**
* The condition `(1650 * 1e18) > (1000 * 1e18)` evaluates to `true`.
* Despite the borrower actually being solvent ($1000 USD collateral vs. $550 USD true total debt), the `require` statement passes due to the inflated `borrowedAmount`.
* The liquidation proceeds, resulting in the unfair seizure of the solvent borrower's collateral by the liquidator.

### Mitigation

The `borrowed` parameter passed to `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` already represents the accurate total USD value of the borrower's debt, having been calculated by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` which correctly sums up all borrowed assets based on their prices. Therefore, no further scaling by an individual asset's borrow index is necessary or correct.

The mitigation involves directly comparing the `borrowed` (total USD debt) and `collateral` (total USD collateral) parameters without introducing an incorrect scaling factor.

**Proposed Change:**
In `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()`, modify the shortfall check as follows:

```diff
             require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
         } else {
             // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
-            uint256 borrowedAmount;
-            borrowedAmount =
-                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
-            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
+            // Compare total USD debt directly with total USD collateral
+            require(borrowed > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
 
             /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */

```
