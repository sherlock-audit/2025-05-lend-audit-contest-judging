# Incorrect LEND Reward Distribution for Borrowers

## Summary
A mathematical error in the borrower reward calculation will cause drastically reduced LEND token distribution to borrowers as the formula incorrectly divides the interest-adjusted borrow amount by the current borrow index, effectively reducing rewards to nearly the original principal amount instead of the full debt position.

## Root Cause
In [LendStorage.sol:364-367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-Sparrow-23/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L364-L367), the `distributeBorrowerLend` function incorrectly divides the already interest-adjusted borrow amount by the current borrow index:

```solidity
uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
    add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
    Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
);
```

The `borrowWithInterest` and `borrowWithInterestSame` functions already return interest-adjusted borrow amounts. By dividing by the current borrow index again, the calculation effectively negates the interest component, reducing rewards to be based mainly on principal rather than the full interest-bearing position.

## Internal pre-conditions
1. Users have borrowed assets from the protocol 
2. Time has passed and interest has accrued (increasing the borrow index)
3. The protocol is distributing LEND rewards to borrowers

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User borrows assets from the protocol
2. Time passes and interest accrues on the borrowed amount
3. The protocol distributes LEND tokens to incentivize borrowers
4. When `distributeBorrowerLend` is called, it:
   - Correctly retrieves the interest-adjusted borrow amounts
   - Incorrectly divides by the current borrow index
   - Calculates rewards based on this reduced amount
5. The borrower receives significantly fewer LEND tokens than they should based on their true debt position

## Impact
This issue results in:

1. Borrowers receiving significantly fewer LEND rewards than they should
2. The reward distribution being inconsistent between suppliers and borrowers (suppliers correctly receive rewards on their full positions)
3. As the borrow index grows over time due to interest accrual, the reward disparity increases
4. Reduced protocol participation from borrowers due to lower incentives
5. Potential imbalance in the protocol as supplying is incentivized relatively higher than borrowing

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated by comparing the supplier and borrower reward calculations:

**For Suppliers:**
```solidity
// Supplier rewards correctly use the full supply amount
uint256 supplierTokens = totalInvestment[supplier][lToken];
uint256 supplierDelta = mul_(supplierTokens, deltaIndex);
```

**For Borrowers:**
```solidity
// Borrower rewards incorrectly divide by borrow index after already adjusting for interest
uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
    add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
    Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
);
uint256 borrowerDelta = mul_(borrowerAmount, deltaIndex);
```

## Mitigation
Remove the division by the current borrow index, as the borrow amounts are already properly adjusted for interest
