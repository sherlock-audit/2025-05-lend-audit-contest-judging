# Double interest application in `CoreRouter` borrow function will cause users to be unable to fully borrow up to the amount allowed by the collateral factor

### Summary

The `borrow` function applies interest adjustments twice to the existing borrow amount when validating collateral levels, thereby inflating users' borrow positions. This prevents users from borrowing up to their entitled limit based on the collateral factor.
The function calculates the total borrow amount used in the collateral comparison as follows:
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
But the borrowed value returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` already includes interest accrued on the existing loan. The code then incorrectly applies the borrow index ratio (currentBorrowIndex / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) to this entire amount, effectively applying interest twice to the existing borrow.
This leads to an inflation of users' borrow positions, making it impossible for users to borrow funds even when they have sufficient collateral according to the protocol's collateral factor.

### Root Cause

In the `CoreRouter` [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157) function, the borrowAmount is calculated by applying interest again to the existing `borrowed` amount, which has already had interest applied

### Attack Path

- User has 100 USDC of collateral
- Collateral factor is 0.75 (75%)
- Existing borrow: 50 USDC
- Current borrow index: 1.1 (10% interest accrued)
- User's stored borrow index: 1.0

The user should be able to borrow up to 75 USDC total (based on collateral factor), meaning they have 20 USDC of borrowing capacity remaining.

The current `borrow` function calculates:
- borrowed = 50 * 1.1 + 20 = 75 USDC (existing borrow with interest + new borrow)
- borrowAmount = 75 * 1.1 / 1.0 = 82.5 USDC
- Check if collateral * collateralFactor (75) >= borrowAmount (82.5)
The check fails, and the transaction reverts with "Insufficient collateral"

### Impact

Users cannot borrow up to the full amount allowed by the collateral factor
