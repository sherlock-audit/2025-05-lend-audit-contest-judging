# Router ETH Depletion through Minimal Borrow Calls

### Summary

From the implementation of the [_lzSend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) the protocol pays for any associated layerzero involved in cross chain borrowing and also sets the `CrossChainRouter` as the refund address in case that any refund should occur due to any failed source messaging. In the [CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) there is no cap or a minimum amount enforced in the borrowing as a user can provide any non-zero amount to borrow and repeatedly do this to deplete the ETH stored in the router which is sponsored by the protocol in sending message. according to the [layerZero docs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/configuration/options#:~:text=all%20new%20Ethereum%20transactions%20cost%2021000%20wei%2C%20but%20other%20chains%20may%20have%20lower%20or%20higher%20opcode%20costs%2C%20or%20entirely%20different%20gas%20mechanisms.) a repeated call which consumes 21000 wei per call on Ethereum or higher in other chain will eventually result in that particular router being out of gas and eventually cause a denial of service for other users who attempt to do same action or transaction.

### Root Cause

In the `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain` there is no cap on the amount to borrow after a user supplied collateral on a particular chain say ETH on base to borrow ETH on ethereum. A user can consistently borrow 1 wei to eventually cause the source chain router to eventually run out of fees when sending cross-chain messaging

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol sets up router with ETH for cross chain messaging

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

1. Consider a malicious actor say Alice who decides to do a cross chain borrow using ETH.
2. Alice locks collateral in ethereum blockchain to borrow same ETH on base.
3. Alice decides to borrow 1 wei worth of ETH.
4. Protocol funds the router with native ETH on ethereum to be able to pay fees in layerzero
5. Alice decides to perform the repeated borrow of 1 wei worth of eth repeatedly.
6. router eventually runs out of eth.
7. Bob an honest user decides to perform same transaction as Alice to borrow eth on base while supplying eth as collateral on source chain(ethereum)
8. Bob can't perform transaction since no fees to send cross-chain messaging.
9. the above process is possible since protocol uses forwards the entire address(this).balance inside the messaging fees struct in [_lzSend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) without an estimate

### Impact

After repeated calls by a malicious user in borrowing as little amount as possible 1 wei the router which is prefunded with ether will eventually consume all causing a denial of service for other users who wishes to interact with the router

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing user to pay for their fees or the contract should have an estimate and the function should require that the contract balance is at least that estimate.
