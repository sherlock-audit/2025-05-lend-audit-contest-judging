# Array Index Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability

**Summary:**
The `LendStorage.sol` contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to missing bounds checks on the `index` parameter in functions designed to remove cross-chain borrow and collateral records. An authorized caller providing an invalid index can cause transactions to revert.

**Vulnerability Detail:**
The `removeCrossChainCollateral` and `removeCrossChainBorrow` functions are intended to remove a `Borrow` struct from dynamic arrays (`crossChainCollaterals` and `crossChainBorrows`). The implementation attempts to access the array element at the provided `index` (`array[index] = array[array.length - 1];`) without first verifying that `index` is less than the array's current length (`array.length`). If `index` is out of bounds (`index >= array.length`), the transaction will revert due to an array index out-of-bounds error. These functions are protected by the `onlyAuthorized` modifier, meaning only whitelisted contracts can call them.

**Impact:**
A malicious or compromised authorized contract can intentionally trigger this vulnerability by calling `removeCrossChainCollateral` or `removeCrossChainBorrow` with an invalid `index`. This will cause the transaction to revert, preventing the successful removal of cross-chain records. If other critical protocol functions (e.g., related to repayment, liquidation, or withdrawal of collateral) depend on the successful execution of these removal functions, they may become unusable, leading to a Denial of Service for affected users or the entire protocol functionality related to these records.

**Code Snippet:**

Recommendation:
Add a require statement at the beginning of both removeCrossChainCollateral and removeCrossChainBorrow functions to validate the index parameter, ensuring it is within the valid range of the array.
