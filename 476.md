# Incorrect Protocol Fee Calculation in Liquidation

### Summary

The `liquidateSeizeUpdate` function in `CoreRouter` calculates the protocol fee on the total `seizeTokens` amount rather than on the liquidation incentive portion. This reduces liquidator profits significantly and creates economic disincentives for liquidations, potentially leading to bad debt accumulation.


### Root Cause

In [`liquidateSeizeUpdate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L292) , the protocol fee is calculated incorrectly:
```javascript
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(...) internal {
    (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
        .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);

    // BUG: Protocol fee calculated on total seize amount
    uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

    // Safety check that reveals the error
    if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
        currentReward = 0;  // Silently hides calculation errors
    }

    uint256 liquidatorShare = seizeTokens - currentReward;
    // ... rest of function
}
```
The protocol fee should be calculated on the liquidation incentive (difference between seize amount and repay amount), not the total seize amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol has set PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA to 2.8% (28000000000000000)
2. Liquidation bonus configured in the underlying Compound system (typically 5-8%)

### External Pre-conditions

Market volatility creating underwater borrowing positions


### Attack Path

// Liquidation parameters:
repayAmount = $10,000 USDC debt
seizeTokens = $10,500 ETH (5% liquidation bonus)
liquidationIncentive = $10,500 - $10,000 = $500

// Current (incorrect) calculation:
protocolFee = $10,500 * 2.8% = $294
liquidatorProfit = $10,500 - $294 - $10,000 = $206

// Expected liquidator profit: $500 * (1 - 2.8%) = $486
// Actual liquidator profit: $206
// Loss to liquidator: $280 (57% reduction in expected profit)



### Impact

Liquidator profits reduced by 50-60% in typical scenarios, and in if we take in consideration gas fees then small amount liquidations will become unprofitable,

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the reward on the liquidation incentive portion and review the same logic in `CrossChainRouter`
