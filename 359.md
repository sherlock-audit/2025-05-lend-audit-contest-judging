# Interest not added to borrowAmount to ensure sufficient collateral

## Summary
The `borrow` function allows user to borrow tokens from protocol, However it fails to cover interest when checking for sufficient collateral which would lead to position not being able to cover interest.

## Root Cause
```solidity
        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
As we can see interest is not added to the borrowAmount to ensure sufficent collateral
## Description
```solidity
     */
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

        // Enter the Compound market
        enterMarkets(_lToken);

```
As we can see when a user borrows tokens the proocol ties to enforce that the collateral can cover interest to be paid to the lender for providing tokens. But the protocol fails to add interest to the borrowedAmount for the user allowing them to bypass having enough collateral to pay interest
## Impact
- Collateral wont be able to cover interest
- Becomes immediately liquidatable

## Recommended Mitigation
Add interest to the borrowAmount
