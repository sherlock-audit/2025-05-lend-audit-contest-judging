# Erroneous Liquidity Validation in Borrow Function



## Finding description and impact

The `borrow` function contains a logical error in its collateral sufficiency check, incorrectly processing the `borrowed` value returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`.

```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = 
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
```

The function then erroneously applies additional calculations to the `borrowed` value, which already incorporates the proposed borrow amount:

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L162

This creates a double-adjustment scenario where the borrow amount is factored in twice, leading to incorrect liquidity assessments.

### Root cause

The core issue stems from misunderstanding the return values of `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. The `borrowed` parameter already reflects the total debt including the new borrow request, making additional index-based adjustments redundant and mathematically incorrect.

### Impact

* Borrowing limits become artificially inflated or deflated
* Valid borrow requests may be incorrectly rejected
* Invalid borrow requests may be incorrectly approved
* Protocol security compromised through inaccurate risk assessment
* Inconsistent user experience due to unpredictable borrow availability

## mitigation

Eliminate the redundant calculation and implement direct comparison:

```solidity
require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

Remove the unnecessary `borrowAmount` calculation entirely:

```solidity
// Remove this entire block
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;
```

This approach respects the intended design of the hypothetical liquidity function and ensures accurate collateral validation.
