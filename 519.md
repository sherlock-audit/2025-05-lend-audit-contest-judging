# Inflation attack on empty markets

### Summary

As a first depositor, a malicious actor can deposit small amounts of collateral, then directly deposit to `LToken` contract to manipulate the exchange rate.

### Root Cause

Due to Solidity nature on division, it rounds down the value + direct asset transfer from attacker.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker must be first depositor
2. Must deposit fraction amount
3. Must direct transfer to LToken

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

1. The exchange rate is calculated this way: `0.02 * 10^(18 + underlying_decimals - 8)`
2. So for tokens like USDC the exchange rate will be -> `2e14`
3. Alice supplies `1 wei` of USDC and gets [minted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80) (1 * 1e18 / 2e14) `5000` lTokens
4. Next she directly transfers `1e6` to the `LToken` contract 
5. Bob now deposits 1e6 (here he can be naturally the 2nd depositor or be front-runned by Alice), the ex. rate will be [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L290-L307) this way as `1 + 1e6 * 1e18 / 5000 = 200000200000000000000`
6. Bob will get -> 1e6 * 1e18 / 200000200000000000000 = `4999` tokens

### Impact

First depositor holds most of the shares, where he can simply redeem and make profit, thus this will mean loss of funds for subsequent depositor.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce `DEAD_SHARES` of `1000` mint them when initializing the `CoreRouter`, eventually burn later.
