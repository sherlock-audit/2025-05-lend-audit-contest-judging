Title: Lendtroller::claimLend can fail if user is in too many markets

Description:

This function lets users claim their LEND rewards from different markets:
```solidity
function claimLend(address holder, LToken[] memory lTokens) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < lTokens.length; i++) {
        LToken lToken = lTokens[i];
        if (markets[address(lToken)].isListed) {
            distributeSupplierLend(address(lToken), holder);
            distributeBorrowerLend(address(lToken), holder);
        }
    }

    grantLendInternal(holder, lendAccrued[holder]);
    lendAccrued[holder] = 0;
}
```

The problem is that it loops through all the lTokens the user gives. There’s no limit. So if a user puts a very long list — like 50 or more — this loop can take up too much gas and make the transaction fail.

It’s worse in the version with multiple users:
```solidity
function claimLend(address[] memory holders, LToken[] memory lTokens) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < holders.length; i++) {
        for (uint j = 0; j < lTokens.length; j++) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

If you have many users and many tokens, it can crash.

Impact:

Users with lots of lTokens may not be able to claim their LEND.

Frontends and bots that call this for many users will fail.

The function will run out of gas if the input is too long.


PoC:

1. A user is part of 40 or more lToken markets.


2. They try to claim rewards using claimLend(holder, lTokens[]).


3. The loop runs too many times.


4. The transaction fails with out-of-gas error.


5. User can’t claim unless they do it in parts.



Fix:

Let users claim one market at a time, like claimLendByMarket(lToken)
Or move claim logic to a helper contract.
