# Missing Interest Accrual When Updating Cross‐Chain Borrow Principal

### Title
Missing Interest Accrual When Updating Cross‐Chain Borrow Principal

### Severity
Medium

### Impact
A borrower who already has an outstanding cross‐chain loan will not have accrued interest applied before taking out additional borrow. As a result, their on‐chain record underestimates the true debt. This allows borrowers to (a) avoid paying interest on the existing balance, (b) borrow more than allowed against outdated debt, and (c) distort liquidation and collateral‐checks, potentially putting the protocol at risk.

### Likelihood
Moderate
•	Any user with an active cross‐chain borrow who triggers a subsequent borrow on the same collateral record will fall into this code path.
•	Cross‐chain borrowers often top up existing positions, so the vulnerable branch is exercised regularly.

### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol

## Description
In the function `_handleValidBorrowRequest` (inside CrossChainRouter.sol), when updating an existing cross‐chain borrow, the code does:
```solidity
LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, index, userBorrows[index]);
```

Here, `userBorrows[index].principle` is the stored principal (i.e. the borrower’s original amount, at the time of their last borrow or repay). However, the current `payload.borrowIndex` already reflects accrued interest since that stored index. Before crediting a new `payload.amount`, one must first convert the old principle into its up‐to‐date value by applying:
```solidity
currentPrincipal = (storedPrincipal × currentBorrowIndex) ÷ storedBorrowIndex.
```
Only after doing so can you correctly add `payload.amount` to yield a new debt‐principal snapshot. Failing to do this effectively ignores all interest that has accrued on the existing balance.

By contrast, in `_handleDestRepayMessage`, the code correctly applies interest before updating:
```solidity
LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);

uint256 currentBorrow = (userBorrows[index].principle * payload.borrowIndex) 
                        / userBorrows[index].borrowIndex;
...
userBorrows[index].principle = currentBorrow - payload.amount;
userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(...);
```


## Exploit Scenario
1.	Alice borrowed 100 DAI cross‐chain when the borrow‐index was 1.00. Over time, interest accrues and the current borrow‐index becomes 1.05—her true debt is now 105 DAI.
2.	Before calling back to redeem or repay, Alice issues another cross‐chain borrow of 20 DAI. Payload’s borrowIndex = 1.05.
3.	The vulnerable code takes storedPrincipal (100) and does:
```solidity
newPrincipal = 100 + 20 = 120  
storedBorrowIndex = 1.05  
```
instead of:
```solidity
currentPrincipal = 100 × 1.05 / 1.00 = 105  
newPrincipal = 105 + 20 = 125  
storedBorrowIndex = 1.05  
```
4.	As a result, Alice’s on‐chain record shows 120 @ index 1.05, whereas her true debt should be 125 @ index 1.05. She has effectively “skipped” paying interest on the original 100.
5.	Later, when collateral checks or liquidations run, protocol calculations reference the outdated principal, thinking Alice owes only 120 × (currentIndex/newIndex) instead of the correct 125. Consequently, she can over‐borrow or avoid liquidation when she should be liquidatable.


## Recommendations
Before adding the new borrow amount, first accrue interest on the existing principle by scaling with the index ratio. For example, in `_handleValidBorrowRequest`, replace:
```solidity
userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(...);
```
with:
```solidity
// 1) Apply interest to the stored principal
uint256 updatedPrincipal = (userBorrows[index].principle * payload.borrowIndex)
                           / userBorrows[index].borrowIndex;

// 2) Add the new borrow amount on top of the up‐to‐date balance
updatedPrincipal += payload.amount;

// 3) Store the new principal and update index
userBorrows[index].principle = updatedPrincipal;
userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(...);
```
