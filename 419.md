# User can instantly make an unhealthy borrow

### Summary

This is due to the following line of code in the [`CoreRouter::borrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145) and `CoreRouter::redeem` functions:
```solidity
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");
```
As seen in the line of code, there can be no practical difference between borrowed value and collateral value. This means that a when a user's borrow becomes liquidateable the protocol immediately realises bad debt 

### Root Cause

There is no gap between collateral value and borrowed value

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User borrows with collateral value being equal to the borrowed asset value
2. Collateral value drops and the protocol goes in bad debt

### Impact

Protocol receives bad debt

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

add some kind of minimum ration between collateral value and borrowed value. For example collateral value being at least 110% of the borrowed value
