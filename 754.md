# Incorrect calculation of borrowed amount when borrowing

### Summary

In `borrow` method the amount of collateral and total borrowed is calculated using `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, but then the returned value is again scaled with borrowIndex. 


### Root Cause

[getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385) returns the collateral and total borrowed amount. The borrowed amount returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is calculated [using](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L509).
Then [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L158) the borrowed amount is being multiplied again by the current borrow index (as in the function above), which is double accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User borrows X amount of tokens
2. User decides to borrow another Y amount of tokens after Z blocks, but he can't because of wrong calculation

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

User provided at least 1 uint of the ERC20 token, if USDC then its enough for the user to have borrowed 1 USDC, not 1e6 USDC.

### Impact

The core invariant "User can borrow tokens up to amount = Collateral Factor * collateral" does not hold. The situation gets worse when user has borrowed more than 1 token, because all of the loans will be multiplied.
