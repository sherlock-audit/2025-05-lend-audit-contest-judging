# M-01 Unsafe ERC20 Transfer in CoreRouter Allows Silent Failures and Protocol State Inconsistency

### [M-01] Unsafe ERC20 Transfer in CoreRouter Allows Silent Failures and Protocol State Inconsistency

**Description:** 
The `CoreRouter::borrow` , `CoreRouter::redeem` uses `transfer()` instead of `safeTransfer()` when handling ERC20 token transfers

**Impact:** 
- If a non-standard ERC20 token is used (e.g., one that does not return a boolean or reverts on failure), the `transfer` call may not behave as expected, potentially resulting in lost funds, failed transfers, or stuck tokens.
- Users may not receive their tokens even though the function call appears to succeed, leading to loss of trust and possible financial loss.
- A malicious or non-standard ERC20 token could cause the following code to silently fail or revert unexpectedly:

**Recommended Mitigation:**


```diff
+
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
-
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

```
