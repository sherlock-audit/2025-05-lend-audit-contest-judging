# Liquidator will be able to avoid re-paying cross-chain loan despite receiving collateral, leading to protocol insolvency

### Summary

Lack of escrow mechanism to hold liquidator's cross-chain repayment funds will cause insolvency for the protocol as liquidators will be able to initiate cross-chain liquidations, receive their share of the borrower's collateral but avoid repaying the loan by not having sufficient balance of the borrowed token.

### Root Cause

In [`CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L172-L192) the funds for repayment are not transferred from the liquidator. Rather, a message is sent to the chain where the collateral is held, causing the collateral to be seized and sent to the liquidator. Then a message is sent back to the chain where the debt was taken, and the funds are transferred on  [CoreRouter.sol:483](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L483). If the liquidator has insufficient balance for repayment, then the final transaction reverts and the liquidator need not incur the cost of repayment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Liquidator holds less balance of the debt token than is required to make the repayment.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Borrower calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` on Chain A and receives the borrowed funds on Chain B.
2. After some time, the position becomes under-collateralized due to market fluctuations.
3. Liquidator calls `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B.
4. Layer zero endpoint calls `CrossChainRouter::receive` on Chain A, and consequently the liquidator receives their share of the borrower's collateral and a `LiquidationSuccess` message is sent to Chain B.
5. Layer zero endpoint calls `CrossChainRouter::receive` on Chain B, however this transaction fails as the liquidator has insufficient balance to make the repayment.
6. Attacker calls `CoreRouter::redeem` on Chain A and receives the underlying collateral asset.

### Impact

The protocol loses both collateral and the loaned funds. The attack can be executed many times, so the protocol will become insolvent. The attacker profits - taking their share of the borrower's collateral with no cost to themselves (except transaction fees).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The repayment funds should be transferred from the liquidator to the `CrossChainRouter` during `CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain`. If a `LiquidationSuccess` message is received, the funds can be used for repayment, otherwise if `LiquidationFailure` message is received they can be returned to the liquidator.
