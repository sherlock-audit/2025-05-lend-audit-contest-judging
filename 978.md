# Incorrect handling of cross-chain borrow updates

### Summary

When a second cross-chain borrow is initiated for the same user and market, it indicates that a previous cross-chain borrow already exists. In such a case, the stored principal and borrowIndex from the first borrow must be correctly updated when adding the new borrow amount.

However, this is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

### Root Cause

On the destination chain, before processing a new borrow, the protocol should first accrue interest on the existing borrow position. This involves updating the principal using the following formula:

`updatedPrincipal = oldPrincipal * (currentBorrowIndex / oldBorrowIndex)`

This ensures that the new borrow amount is added on top of the accrued debt, not on top of the original principal.


In the `_handleValidBorrowReques`t function, where the cross-chain borrow is updated, the code directly adds the new amount to the existing principal without accounting for accrued interest. This skips the interest accrual step, leading to an inaccurate principal.

```solidity
            // Update existing borrow
            LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
            
            userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
           
            userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

Two cross chain borrow should be made.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The` crossChainBorrow.principal` on the destination chain will not match the corresponding `crossChainCollateral.principal` stored on the source chain.

Accrued interest is not accounted for, which can lead to repayment mismatch, inaccurate accounting, or potential exploits where users borrow more than they should be allowed.

The protocol's accounting becomes inconsistent across chains, especially as borrow indices evolve over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not add the amount directly to the principal; first, accrue the interest.
