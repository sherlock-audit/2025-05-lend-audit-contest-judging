# Baddebts will continue to accrue for some underwater positions

### Summary

Similar to how Aave works, compoundV2 also do not socialize baddebt. Instead baddebts are cleard by directly paying up the defaulted user's loan by paying on their behalf. However, the `CoreRouter` contract  does not extend this functionality of  repaying other user's loan on their behalf. Hence bad debt may continue to accrue.
In the snippet below we can see that the repay function enforces that a user pays directly for their own loan

```solidity
    function repayBorrow(uint256 _amount, address _lToken) public {
@>>     repayBorrowInternal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _lToken, true);
    }
```

Let us look into the liquidation flow.
A user is no longer liquidatable once their collateral can no longer back their loan . This is because `seizeTokens` is never calculated based a user's collateral, but based on the gobal state of the `borrowedlToken` as perceived from the `lendtroller`.

```solidity 
    function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
        address sender,
        address borrower,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address borrowedlToken,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) internal {
        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
            .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");

        // Revert if borrower collateral token balance < seizeTokens
        //@audit positions in bad debt can never be liquidated
 @>>    require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) >= seizeTokens, "Insufficient collateral");

        uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

        // Just for safety, Never gonna occur
        if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
            currentReward = 0;
        }
```

A position can be partially/ gradually liquidated during bad debts, such that they end up having no/liitle insvestments that can be seized while their debts are yet to be cleared completely making it unattractive to liquidate, or even unliquidatable due to the check made in the above snippet. Such positions will remain unliquidated, causing baddebts to accrue in the system. Such user may decide to not pay back the loans

### Root Cause

Not extending the functionality to repay on behalf of other users to effectively clear baddebts

### Internal Pre-conditions

* User accrues baddebt due to fluctuation in price

### External Pre-conditions

* Price crashes

### Attack Path

1. Price changes
2. User falls into bad debts.
3. User gets partially liquidated until collateral drops significantly until there is nothing to seize again
4. User position becomes unliquidatable

### Impact

More loss to suppliers

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Extend the functionality to repay on behalf of another user to the `CoreRouter`.
