# USDT and similar tokens does not return bool due to incompatible with ERC20 Standard

### Summary

The current implementation of the redeem() function uses IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, amount) to send ERC-20 tokens to the user. While this works with standard-compliant tokens, it does not safely support non-standard ERC-20 tokens — some of which may not return a boolean value or behave inconsistently with the ERC-20 specification.

To ensure consistent, safe behavior across all ERC-20 implementations, this report recommends replacing .transfer() with OpenZeppelin’s safeTransfer().

### Root Cause

`IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying); // transfer is used 
`

### Impact

1. It would not revert even though the transaction failed.

2. Silent Transfer Failures

Tokens like USDT (Tether) return void instead of bool.

- The .transfer() call does not revert even if the transfer fails.
- This causes tokens to silently not transfer, leading to
- Incorrect accounting
- Users not receiving expected tokens
- Security inconsistencies in downstream logic


### Mitigation

The safeTransfer() function from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library can be used to mitigate this issue
