# Liquidation method inflates the borrowed amount of the user

### Summary

Liquidate borrow calculates the total borrowed amount of the user by using the currentBorrowIndex of the borrowed token, then again scales the borrowedAmount with currentBorrowIndex

### Root Cause

`liquidateBorrow` uses [getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385) which returns the total borrowed amount (scaled with the current borrow index) and collateral.
In [liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347) the borrowed amount is scaled again.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

User supplied 100 tokens at CF 50%
User borrows 30 tokens at borrow index 1
After 10 blocks the borrow index is 1.5 so his borrowed amount is 30*1.5/1 = 45 his CF is 45% at this moment
User can liquidate him, because the calculation of his borrowed amount will be: 30*1.5*1.5 = 67.5 > 50

### Impact

User can be liquidated not if his collateral is bellow the Collateral Factor, but even if his collateral is at level greater than Collateral Factor
