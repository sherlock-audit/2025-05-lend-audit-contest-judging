# Incorrect Principal Update in _handleValidBorrowRequest Understates Cross-Chain Debt Obligation on Collateral Chain

### Summary

When `_handleValidBorrowRequest` on the collateral chain (Chain A) updates an existing `crossChainBorrows` record after a user performs an additional borrow on the debt chain (Chain B), it {root cause: incorrectly adds the new `payload.amount` (from Chain B) directly to the old stored `principle` without first accounting for interest accrued on the old principal up to the new `payload.borrowIndex` (from Chain B)}. This will cause an {impact: understatement of the user's true cross-chain debt obligation recorded on the collateral chain} for {affected party: the LEND protocol}. This occurs as {actor: the system processing a `ValidBorrowRequest` LayerZero message from a debt chain} will {vulnerability path: execute `_handleValidBorrowRequest` which sums principals from different time bases (the old principal and the new principal amount from the payload), leading to a lower total recorded principal on Chain A than the actual combined value of the old debt (with accrued interest) plus the new debt}. This miscalculation can lead to an overestimation of the user's overall borrowing capacity or collateral health, increasing the risk of bad debt for the protocol.


### Root Cause

- In `CrossChainRouter.sol`, within the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function, specifically the line where an existing borrow record's principal is updated: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L708-L712

```solidity
  // Inside the if (found) block:
  LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
  userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount; // Vulnerable line
```

The `principle` of an existing `LendStorage.crossChainBorrows` record (on Chain A, the collateral chain) is updated by directly adding the new `payload.amount` (representing a fresh principal amount borrowed on Chain B at `payload.borrowIndex`). This addition is incorrect because it fails to account for the interest that has accrued on the original `userBorrows[index].principle` (which was associated with the older `userBorrows[index].borrowIndex` from Chain B) from the time it was last recorded up to the new `payload.borrowIndex`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `borrower` (identified as `payload.sender` in the function) has an existing cross-chain borrow record stored in `LendStorage.crossChainBorrows` on the current chain (Chain A - the collateral chain). This record has an existing `principle` (e.g., `P_old`) and `borrowIndex` (e.g., `B_old`, which is the market borrow index from the debt chain, Chain B, at the time `P_old` was recorded). The record in `crossChainBorrows` on Chain A would have its `srcEid` field (representing the debt chain) matching the `srcEid` parameter of `_handleValidBorrowRequest`, and its `destEid` field (representing the collateral chain) matching `currentEid`.
2.  The `borrower` performs an additional borrow of `payload.amount` (e.g., `P_new`) on the debt chain (Chain B, identified by `srcEid` in the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function parameters).
3.  The debt chain (Chain B) successfully processes this new borrow and sends a `ValidBorrowRequest` LayerZero message back to the current chain (Chain A). This message contains `payload.amount = P_new` and `payload.borrowIndex = B_new` (where `B_new` is the current market borrow index on Chain B, and typically `B_new > B_old` due to interest accrual).
4.  The `lendStorage.findCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, srcEid, currentEid, payload.destlToken)` call within `_handleValidBorrowRequest` successfully finds the existing record (`found == true`).


### External Pre-conditions

1.  The LayerZero message of type `ValidBorrowRequest` (originated from the debt chain, Chain B, whose EID is `srcEid`) is successfully received and routed to the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function on the collateral chain (Chain A, whose EID is `currentEid`).
2.  Interest has accrued on the debt chain (Chain B) such that its market borrow index has increased from the `borrower`'s previously recorded `userBorrows[index].borrowIndex` (i.e., `B_old`) to the new `payload.borrowIndex` (i.e., `B_new`).


### Attack Path

*(This describes a bug path leading to miscalculation, not necessarily a direct attack by a malicious user but rather a flaw in protocol logic)*
1.  A `borrower` establishes an initial cross-chain borrow: they supply collateral on Chain A, and a borrow of `Amount1` (let's call this `P1`) occurs on Chain B. Chain A's `LendStorage.crossChainBorrows` records this for the `borrower` and `payload.srcToken` (underlying on Chain A) with `principle = P1`, `borrowIndex = B1` (where `B1` is the market borrow index on debt Chain B at that time), `srcEid` (in struct, pointing to Chain B) = EID of Chain B, and `destEid` (in struct, pointing to Chain A) = EID of Chain A (`currentEid`).
2.  Time passes. Interest accrues on `P1` on Chain B. The market borrow index on Chain B increases from `B1` to `B2`. The actual current value of this initial debt on Chain B is now `CurrentValue_P1_on_B = (P1 * B2) / B1`.
3.  The `borrower` borrows an additional `Amount2` (this is `payload.amount` from the new message, let's call it `P2`) on Chain B. The market borrow index on Chain B at this moment is `B2` (this is `payload.borrowIndex` in the new message).
4.  Chain B processes this new borrow successfully and sends a `ValidBorrowRequest` LayerZero message back to Chain A. The payload includes `sender = borrower`, `srcToken = (underlying on Chain A)`, `destlToken = (LToken on Chain B)`, `amount = P2`, and `borrowIndex = B2`. The message is received on Chain A from `srcEid = (EID of Chain B)`.
5.  On Chain A, `CrossChainRouter._handleValidBorrowRequest` receives this message.
6.  The function finds the existing borrow record from step 1 (`found == true`) using `lendStorage.findCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, srcEid_ChainB, currentEid_ChainA, payload.destlToken_ChainB)`.
7.  The flawed logic is executed: `userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle (which is P1) + payload.amount (which is P2);`
8.  The new recorded principal on Chain A for this cross-chain debt becomes `P_recorded_on_A = P1 + P2`.
9.  The `userBorrows[index].borrowIndex` is updated to `B2` (`payload.borrowIndex`).
10. The correct total principal equivalent that should be recorded on Chain A (relative to `B2`) is `P_correct_for_A = CurrentValue_P1_on_B + P2 = ((P1 * B2) / B1) + P2`.
11. Since interest has accrued on Chain B (`B2 > B1`), it means `(P1 * B2) / B1 > P1`.
12. Therefore, `P_recorded_on_A = P1 + P2` is **less than** `P_correct_for_A`. The debt obligation as recorded on the collateral chain (Chain A) is understated.


### Impact

* The protocol understates the true value of a user's cross-chain debt obligations when these are recorded or updated on the collateral chain (Chain A).
* When the user's overall liquidity and solvency are calculated by the protocol (e.g., by `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which would sum up the current values of these `crossChainBorrows` records based on their stored (understated) principals and associated borrow indices), it will lead to an underestimation of the user's total liabilities.
* This results in an overestimation of the user's available borrowing capacity or collateral health across the multi-chain system.
* Consequently, the user may be able to borrow more than their collateral legitimately supports system-wide, or they might avoid or delay a necessary liquidation. This increases the **risk of bad debt for the LEND protocol**.


### PoC

A conceptual PoC is outlined in the Vulnerability Path. A coded PoC would involve:
1.  Mocking `LendStorage.sol` (specifically `crossChainBorrows` mapping, `findCrossChainBorrow`, `getCrossChainBorrows`, `updateCrossChainBorrow`) and `CrossChainRouter.sol` (the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function and `currentEid` state variable).
2.  Simulate an initial cross-chain borrow by a `testBorrower`:
    * On Chain A (collateral chain, where `_handleValidBorrowRequest` executes, `currentEid = EID_A`), create a `LendStorage.Borrow` record in `crossChainBorrows` for `testBorrower` and `testSrcToken_ChainA`. This record is created as if a borrow happened on Chain B: `{srcEid: EID_B, destEid: EID_A, principle: P1 (e.g., 1000 units), borrowIndex: B1 (e.g., `1e18`), borrowedlToken: testLToken_ChainB, srcToken: testSrcToken_ChainA}`.
3.  Prepare an `LZPayload` simulating a subsequent borrow on Chain B by `testBorrower`:
    * `payload.sender = testBorrower`
    * `payload.srcToken = testSrcToken_ChainA` (This is the key for `crossChainBorrows` on Chain A)
    * `payload.destlToken = testLToken_ChainB` (The LToken on Chain B)
    * `payload.amount = P2` (e.g., 500 units, newly borrowed on Chain B)
    * `payload.borrowIndex = B2` (e.g., `1.1e18`, representing a 10% interest accrual period on Chain B since `B1`).
4.  Call `_handleValidBorrowRequest(payload, EID_B)` on the mocked `CrossChainRouter` on Chain A.
5.  After the call, inspect the `crossChainBorrows` record for `testBorrower` and `testSrcToken_ChainA` that matches the (Chain B `srcEid` in struct, Chain A `destEid` in struct, Chain B `LToken`) key.
6.  Assert that the updated `principle` in the record is `P1 + P2` (i.e., `1000 + 500 = 1500`).
7.  Assert that the updated `borrowIndex` in the record is `B2` (i.e., `1.1e18`).
8.  Calculate the correct expected principle that should have been stored on Chain A:
    * `currentValueOfP1_on_B_terms = (P1 * B2) / B1 = (1000 * 1.1e18) / 1e18 = 1100`.
    * `P_correct_for_A_record = currentValueOfP1_on_B_terms + P2 = 1100 + 500 = 1600`.
9.  The PoC demonstrates that the stored principle (`1500`) is less than the correct principle (`1600`), signifying an understatement of the cross-chain debt obligation recorded on the collateral chain.
