# Incorrect Token Redemption Due to Use of Stale Exchange Rate

### Summary

The protocol uses `exchangeRateStored()` to compute the number of `lTokens` redeemed. However, this value may be stale if `accrueInterest()` has not been called recently. As a result, redeemed token amounts may not reflect the true value of the underlying tokens.



### Root Cause

```solidity
function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        @> uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

        // Perform redeem
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

        // Update total investment
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
        uint256 newInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) - _amount;
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, newInvestment);

        if (newInvestment == 0) {
            lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        }

        emit RedeemSuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, expectedUnderlying, _amount);

        return 0;
    }
```

Relying on exchangeRateStored() returns the last checkpointed exchange rate, which may be outdated if no interaction (e.g. borrow, redeem, or explicit accrueInterest) has occurred recently. Meanwhile, `redeem()` itself calls `accrueInterest()`, updating the true rate before minting. The mismatch between the stale snapshot and the post-accrual rate causes the manual calculation to diverge from the actual lTokens issued.

### Impact

- User receives fewer underlying tokens than expected: because the calculation uses a stale (usually lower) exchange rate, the `expectedUnderlying` amount sent may be less than the real amount the lTokens are worth at redeem time.
- If the stale rate happens to be higher than the real exchange rate (less common), the user might get more tokens than expected, causing a loss for the protocol.
- Meanwhile, the contract still burns the full amount of lTokens, so the userâ€™s `totalInvestment` and lToken accounting become inconsistent.
