# Broken transfer functionality::Wrong assumption that the user is on the same chain

### Summary

Here are some of the snippets of the function where assets are being transffered to users` cross chain:


The below is from the CoreRouter

[Link to the code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L195)


```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Only callable by CrossChainRouter
     */
    function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");

        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");

        require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

        IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);  
    }
```

the above originates from the CrossChainRouter.sol 

```solidity
CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, destUnderlying);
```

Also, 
the below is from the `_handleRepayment` of the `CrossChainRouter.sol`

```solidity
    function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);  //@audit How can the liquidator get who is on another chain get a ERC20 transfer
        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```

The problem is that the payload.sender is the address of the sender on the chain from the transaction was initiated. 

The `IERC20.safeTransfer/transfer` assumes that the same address of the user exists on the core chain.

For e.g:

- UserA with addr(0x044000) initiates a cross-chain transaction with his addr. as the sender address. on the source chain.
- The transaction executes on the destination chain and sends the amount to the user on the same address with which the transaction was initiated i.e addr(0x044000) .

It's not necessary that the user has the same address on the destination chain, it can be something else. 

The owner of the addr(0x044000) can be someone else on the destination chain.

The Protocol assumes that the address of the user on the source chain and the address of the user on destination chain is same. Thus the protocol transfers to the same address with which the transaction was initiated.

Which is a broken logic.

The user doesn't get their funds and it's irrecoverable.

It's a logical flaw.


### Root Cause

- Assuming that the address of the user on source chain and destination chain is same and thus transferring back to the same address. with which the transaction was initiated on the source chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- Not an attack, it's a logical flaw.

### Impact

- The user suffers a loss of his funds while performing cross-chain borrw/liquidation etc.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a receiver parameter to the LZPayload struct of the crossChainRouter and send the funds to the receiver address on the destination chain.

```solidity
    struct LZPayload {
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 borrowIndex;
        uint256 collateral;
        address sender;
++   address receiver
        address destlToken;
        address liquidator;
        address srcToken;
        uint8 contractType;
    }
```
