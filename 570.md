# USDC Blacklisting of Self-Repaying Borrowers Leads to Permanent Debt Lock

## Title (submitted)
USDC Blacklisting of Self-Repaying Borrowers Leads to Permanent Debt Lock

## Summary
The [`repayBorrow()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L212-L214) function allows the `borrower` to act as their own `liquidator` (`borrower` = `liquidator`). If the `borrower` is blacklisted by `USDC` (`underlyingToken`), the repayment transaction will fail, locking both the debt repayment and collateral in the protocol indefinitely.

## Root Cause
The [`repayBorrowInternal()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459-L504) function uses the same address (`msg.sender`) as both `borrower` and `liquidator` when called via `repayBorrow()`.
```solidity
    function repayBorrow(uint256 _amount, address _lToken) public { 
        repayBorrowInternal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _lToken, true);
    }
```
When a `borrower` is blacklisted by `USDC`, the `safeTransferFrom` call in the `repayBorrowInternal` function fails

## Internal Pre-conditions
Borrower has an open USDC-denominated debt position.
Borrower’s address is blacklisted by USDC.
Borrower calls `repayBorrow()`

## External Pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User borrows 100 `USDC` (collateralized with `ETH`).
2. User’s address is blacklisted by `USDC`.
3. User calls `repayBorrow()`:
4. Contract attempts USDC.transferFrom(borrower, protocol, 100e6) but it reverts.
5. Debt remains unpaid.
Borrower is forced into liquidation since they can repay their debt.

## Impact
Blacklisted borrowers cannot repay debts hence these debt continues accruing interest indefinitely to an extend where they face inevitable liquidation. Therefore users will their collateral despite having repayment capability.

## POC
1. Modify `ERC20Mock.sol` as follows:
```diff
    contract ERC20Mock is ERC20 {
+       mapping(address => bool) public isBlacklisted;

        constructor() ERC20("ERC20Mock", "E20M") {}

        function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external {
            _mint(account, amount);
        }

        function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external {
            _burn(account, amount);
        }

        // Add these functions
+       function setBlacklist(address user, bool status) external {
+           isBlacklisted[user] = status;
+       }

+       function _beforeTokenTransfer(
+           address from,
+           address to,
+           uint256 amount
+       ) internal override {
+           require(!isBlacklisted[from], "USDC: sender blacklisted");
+           require(!isBlacklisted[to], "USDC: recipient blacklisted");
+           super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
+       }
    }
```
2. Add the following test in `test/TestBorrowingCrossChain.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function test_repayBorrow_fails_when_caller_is_blacklisted(uint256 amountToSupply, uint256 amountToBorrow) public {
        // Bound amount between 1e18 and 1e30 to ensure reasonable test values
        amountToSupply = bound(amountToSupply, 1e18, 1e30);

        // Fund Router A with ETH for LayerZero fees
        vm.deal(address(routerA), 1 ether);

        // First supply tokens as collateral on Chain A
        (address tokenA, address lTokenA) = _supplyA(amountToSupply);

        // Calculate maximum allowed borrow (70% of collateral to leave some safety margin)
        uint256 maxBorrow = (amountToSupply * 70) / 100;

        // Get initial balances
        uint256 initialTokenBalance = IERC20(tokenA).balanceOf(deployer);

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // Expect BorrowSuccess event
        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit BorrowSuccess(deployer, lTokenA, maxBorrow);

        // Borrow tokens
        coreRouterA.borrow(maxBorrow, tokenA);

        // Verify balances after borrowing
        assertEq(
            IERC20(tokenA).balanceOf(deployer) - initialTokenBalance,
            maxBorrow,
            "Should receive correct amount of borrowed tokens"
        );

        // Verify borrow balance is tracked correctly
        assertEq(
            lendStorageA.borrowWithInterestSame(deployer, lTokenA),
            maxBorrow,
            "Borrow balance should be tracked correctly"
        );

        // Check any crosschain borrow details
        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorageA.getCrossChainBorrows(deployer, tokenA);
        assertEq(userBorrows.length, 0, "User should have 0 cross chain borrows");

        // check borrows in this chain
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorageA.getBorrowBalance(deployer, lTokenA);
        assertEq(borrowBalance.amount, maxBorrow, "User borrow balance should match");

        // From here, user can only repay their debt themselves in the chain they took the borrow

        // mint user more tokens
        uint256 amount = maxBorrow;
        ERC20Mock(tokenA).mint(deployer, amount);

        // deployer gets blacklisted by USDC
        ERC20Mock(tokenA).setBlacklist(deployer, true);

        // should have been blacklisted
        assertEq(ERC20Mock(tokenA).isBlacklisted(deployer), true);


        IERC20(tokenA).approve(address(coreRouterA), amount);

        // Expect revert due to blacklisting
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("USDC: sender blacklisted"));
        coreRouterA.repayBorrow(maxBorrow, lTokenA);

        // borrow should remain unchanged
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrowBalance = lendStorageA.getBorrowBalance(deployer, lTokenA);
        assertEq(currentBorrowBalance.amount, maxBorrow, "User debt should remain unchanged");

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Mitigation
Let a third party repay on behalf of the `borrower` same as in `repayCrossChainBorrow()` function
```diff
    function repayBorrow(uint256 _amount, address _lToken) public { 
-       repayBorrowInternal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _lToken, true); 
+       repayBorrowInternal(borrowerr, msg.sender, _amount, _lToken, true); 
    }
```
