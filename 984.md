# # Insufficient Repayment Amount Validation



## Finding description and impact

The `repayBorrowInternal` function accepts a `_amount` parameter to specify the repayment amount. While the function properly handles the special case where `_amount` equals `type(uint256).max` by capping it to the borrowed amount, it fails to validate that user-specified amounts do not exceed the outstanding debt.

## Code snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L480

This validation gap can result in:

* Users inadvertently overpaying their debt, causing excess tokens to become locked within the contract
* Accounting discrepancies if the underlying protocol lacks proper over-repayment handling mechanisms
* Unpredictable behavior that may affect integrators and users who depend on precise balance calculations

**Root cause:**

The current implementation:
```solidity
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```

Only validates the maximum value case but neglects to ensure `_amount <= borrowedAmount` for all other inputs. Evidence of prior consideration for proper validation exists in commented code but remains unimplemented.

## Mitigation

Implement comprehensive amount validation by updating the logic to always cap repayments:

```solidity
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount >= borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```

For stricter input validation, consider reverting on over-repayment attempts:

```solidity
require(_amount <= borrowedAmount, "Repayment exceeds borrowed amount");
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount;
```

This approach prevents over-repayment scenarios and maintains consistent accounting practices and user experience.
