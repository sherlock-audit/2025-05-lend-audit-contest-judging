# Liquidator will prematurely liquidate healthy users due to double-counted interest

###  Summary

The logic in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` applies borrow index scaling **twice**, inflating the effective borrow amount. This causes the protocol to **overestimate** the borrower’s debt and falsely enforce a shortfall. In scenarios where a user is actually healthy, this bug can still allow or reject liquidations incorrectly, depending on borrow/reserve drift.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol: 238, 347 liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` function, the parameter `borrowed` passed from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` already includes borrow interest:

```solidity
function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
    external
{
    // The lToken of the borrowed asset
    address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset);

    LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();

238    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);

    liquidateBorrowInternal(
        msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
    );
}
```

```solidity
function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
    address payable lTokenBorrowed,
    address borrower,
    uint256 repayAmount,
    uint256 collateral,
    uint256 borrowed
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Determine borrowIndex and borrowAmount based on chain type
    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

    // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
    if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
        require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
    } else {
        // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
347        borrowedAmount =
            (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

        require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

This applies interest twice:

- First in the `borrowed` variable (already includes it, but doesn't update `borrowBalance.borrowIndex`)
- Then again via ratio of `borrowIndex / borrowBalance.borrowIndex`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A borrower has open debt
2. Liquidator attempts to liquidate
3. `liquidateBorrow()` is called
4. `borrowed` already reflects borrow + interest
5. Scaling reapplied

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow()`
2. Function calls `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` → returns borrow including interest
3. Code incorrectly rescales using borrow indexes again
4. Resulting `borrowedAmount` is larger than real
5. Collateral appears insufficient or liquidation appears allowed when it shouldn’t be
6. Liquidation may:
    - Be incorrectly blocked
    - Be incorrectly allowed (grief or economic loss to borrower)

### Impact

- Borrowers may be liquidated even when healthy
- Liquidators may be blocked from valid liquidations
- Protocol accounting and user trust at risk
- Potential griefing vector or unintended loss of collateral


### Mitigation

Remove the incorrect line:

```solidity
-        borrowedAmount =
            (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

-        require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
+        require(borrowed > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```
