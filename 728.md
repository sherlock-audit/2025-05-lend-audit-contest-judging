# Incorrect liquidity check leading to users unable to perform cross-chain borrowing as expected

### Attack Path

When a cross-chain message reaches the destination chain (e.g., From Chain A to Chain B - Dest Chain = B), Chain B's `CrossChainRouter._handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` will be executed.

In Line 622 of the `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` function below, it will check if the source chain's collateral is more than the total borrowed amount. However, the issue/bug is that it is not a correct or symmetric comparison.

The `totalBorrowed` consists of the debt/borrowed amount from "same-chain" + other chains (cross-chains). However, during the comparison, only collateral from the source chain (Chain A in this case) is used. Thus, it ignores the collateral on Chain B even if the borrower has supplied collateral in Chain B.

As a result, the borrowing will fail even if the borrower has sufficient collateral in "Chain A + Chain B" to support the borrowing.
