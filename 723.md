### Attack Path

In the comment and the logic of the `borrowWithInterest` function below, the protocol makes the assumption that only `crossChainBorrows` or `crossChainCollaterals` will be populated, but not both. However, this is an incorrect assumption.

Assume that there are three (3) chains - Chain A, B, and C.

1. In Chain A, Bob borrowed 10,000 USDT from Chain B. At the end, Chain A's `crossChainBorrows[Bob][USDT][0]` will be set to 10,000 USDT.
2. However, it is possible for Bob in Chain B to initiate a cross-borrowing request to borrow 10,000 USDT from Chain A. At the end, Chain A's `crossChainCollaterals[Bob][USDT][0]` will be set to 10,000 USDT.

Thus, this proves that it is incorrect to assume that only one of them will be populated as the above scenario shows that it is possible for both `crossChainBorrows` or `crossChainCollaterals` to be populated.

In the above scenario, due to the if-else statement in Line 487 below, when the `crossChainBorrows` is populated, the `crossChainCollaterals` will be ignored.

If the logic is correct, Bob should have a debt of 20,000 USDT from both `crossChainBorrows` or `crossChainCollaterals`. However, since debt in `crossChainCollaterals` is ignored, the protocol will wrongly determine that Bob only has a debt of 10,000 USDT. With incorrect debt in Bob's account (lower than expected), he could continue to borrow more assets than expected from the protocol, effectively stealing funds.

### Impact

With incorrect debt in Bob's account (lower than expected), he could continue to borrow more assets than expected from the protocol, effectively stealing funds.
