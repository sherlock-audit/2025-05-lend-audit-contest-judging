# H-03 Cross-Chain Collateral Tracking Failure in Liquidation Process

### Summary

During the cross-chain liquidation process, the protocol fails to properly track cross-chain collaterals. The call to [findCrossChainCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L683) function during the liquidation process will never find the cross-chain collateral because it's looking for a record with `srcEid` set to 0, when the record is added to [crossChainCollaterals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L641), the `srcEid` is set to the chain the request is coming from.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the mismatch between how cross-chain collaterals are stored and how they are queried during the liquidation process. When adding a cross-chain collateral record, the `srcEid` is set to the source chain's ID (Chain A):

```solidity
// CrossChainRouter.sol, line 641
lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(
                payload.sender,
                destUnderlying,
                LendStorage.Borrow({
                    srcEid: srcEid, // Chain where the borrow request comes from
                    destEid: currentEid, // This chain
                    principle: payload.amount,
                    borrowIndex: currentBorrowIndex,
                    borrowedlToken: payload.destlToken,
                    srcToken: payload.srcToken
                })
            );
```

But when querying for this record during liquidation, the function looks for a record with `srcEid` set to 0: 
```solidity
function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Find the specific collateral record
        (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
            payload.sender,
            underlying,
            currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
@>          0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        );

        require(found, "Borrow position not found");
		// rest of code...
}
```

This mismatch ensures that `findCrossChainCollateral` will never find the correct collateral record because the function will match all the `srcEid`, `destEid`, `borrowedlToken` and `srcToken` not just some of them:
```solidity
function findCrossChainCollateral(
        address user,
        address underlying,
        uint256 srcEid,
        uint256 destEid,
        address borrowedlToken,
        address srcToken
    ) public view returns (bool, uint256) {
        Borrow[] memory userCollaterals = crossChainCollaterals[user][underlying];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCollaterals.length;) {
            if (
@>              userCollaterals[i].srcEid == srcEid && userCollaterals[i].destEid == destEid
                    && userCollaterals[i].borrowedlToken == borrowedlToken && userCollaterals[i].srcToken == srcToken
            ) {
                return (true, i);
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return (false, 0);
    }

```
In the case where the record is not found in this final step, the transaction reverts, skipping the repayment of the borrow from the liquidator.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A The bug exists from the very beginning

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user has borrowed tokens in Chain B using collateral in Chain A
2. The cross-chain collateral record has been added to `crossChainCollaterals` with the correct `srcEid`
3. The position becomes liquidable
4. The liquidation process is initiated
5. The protocol attempts to find the cross-chain collateral record

### Attack Path

1. User borrows tokens in Chain B using collateral in Chain A
2. Protocol adds cross-chain collateral record with `srcEid` set to Chain A's ID
3. Position becomes liquidable
4. Liquidation process is initiated in Chain B
5. Protocol attempts to find cross-chain collateral using `findCrossChainCollateral`
6. Function fails to find the record because it's looking for `srcEid = 0`
7. Final liquidation step reverts in chain B
   - At this point the actual transfer of tokens for the liquidation fails

### Impact

This vulnerability has a significant impact on the core functionality of the protocol as it prevents the liquidation process from being completed successfully in Chain B. The failure to properly track cross-chain collaterals means that the protocol cannot accurately verify and process liquidations across different chains, leading to potential protocol. This affects not only the immediate liquidation transaction but also the protocol's ability to maintain proper accounting.
