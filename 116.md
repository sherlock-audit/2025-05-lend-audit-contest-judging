# User will clear same-chain debt on destination chain by repaying only cross-chain debt

### Summary

Incorrect borrow amount calculation in cross-chain repayments will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as a borrower will repay only their small cross-chain debt to clear their large same-chain debt

### Root Cause

When the user repays a cross-chain debt by calling `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` in one chain, this invokes `CoreRouter::repayBorrowInternal()` with `_isSameChain = false`.

In `CoreRouter::repayBorrowInternal()` the condition `repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount` uses different borrow amount calculations for same-chain vs cross-chain repayments, but applies the same debt clearing logic regardless of the repayment type, allowing cross-chain repayments to incorrectly clear same-chain debt.

### Attack Path

1. **User borrows 1000 tokens on chain B** by calling `CoreRouter::borrow()` with `_amount = 1000` and `_token = USDC`
2. **User initiates cross-chain borrow of 100 tokens** on chain B from collateral on chain A through the cross-chain router in chain A
3. **User repays the cross-chain debt fully** by calling repay through the cross-chain liquidation mechanism with `_amount = 100`
4. **The system incorrectly clears all debt** because `repayBorrowInternal()` is called with `_isSameChain = false`, causing `borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken)` to return only the cross-chain amount (100), and since `repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount` (100 == 100), the function calls `lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance()` and `lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset()`, clearing the user's entire debt including the 1000 token same-chain borrow.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a direct loss equal to the same-chain borrowed amount that gets incorrectly cleared. The attacker gains the unpaid debt amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It should also check for `_isSameChain` before calling `removeBorrowBalance()` and `removeUserBorrowedAsset()`
