# cross-chain borrow is not reduced/cleared on source chain during cross-chain liquidation

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidations, the destination chain sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to the source chain. The source chain then seizes the user's collateral in the `_handleLiquidationExecute()` function. However, **the user’s borrow is not cleared or reduced** from the `crossChainBorrows` mapping in this function. 

As a result, even though the user's borrow has been repaid (either partially or fully) by the liquidator and the collateral is seized, the protocol still considers the user to have an active cross-chain borrow. This leads to an inconsistency in the accounting of outstanding debts and opens up critical vulnerabilities.

```solidity
function _handleLiquidationExecute(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // Execute the seize of collateral
    uint256 protocolSeizeShare = mul_(payload.amount, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

    require(protocolSeizeShare < payload.amount, "Invalid protocol share");

    uint256 liquidatorShare = payload.amount - protocolSeizeShare;

    // Update protocol rewards
    lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(
        payload.destlToken, lendStorage.protocolReward(payload.destlToken) + protocolSeizeShare
    );

    // Distribute LEND rewards
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(payload.destlToken, payload.sender); // borrower
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(payload.destlToken, payload.liquidator); // liquidator

    // Update total investment for borrower
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
        payload.sender,
        payload.destlToken,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) - payload.amount
    );

    // Update total investment for liquidator
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
        payload.liquidator,
        payload.destlToken,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
    );

    // Clear user supplied asset if total investment is 0
    if (lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) == 0) {
        lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(payload.sender, payload.destlToken);
    }

    _send(
        srcEid,
        payload.amount,
        0,
        0,
        payload.sender,
        payload.destlToken, 
        destLtoken,
        payload.liquidator,
        payload.srcToken, 
        ContractType.LiquidationSuccess
    );

    // @audit-issue: Borrow is not reduced or removed in crossChainBorrows mapping after liquidation
}

### Root Cause

The `crossChainBorrows` mapping is never updated during the `_handleLiquidationExecute()` call on the source chain, leaving the borrow information even after liquidation(repayment) has occurred.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user has $6,250 worth of ETH as collateral on Chain A.
2. They have two borrow positions:
   - A cross-chain borrow of $2,500 USDC on Chain B.
   - A same-chain borrow of $2,500 DAI on Chain A.
3. Their total debt is $5,000, making their LTV = 80% ($5,000 / $6,250).
4. The protocol’s liquidation LTV (LLTV) is 75%, so the user is eligible for liquidation.
5. A liquidator initiates cross-chain liquidation of the $2,500 USDC debt on Chain B.
6. The liquidator repays the $2,500 USDC and sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to Chain A.
7. On Chain A, `_handleLiquidationExecute()` is triggered, and $2,500 worth of ETH collateral is seized from the user.
8. However, due to this bug, the cross-chain borrow is not cleared from the `crossChainBorrows` mapping on Chain B.
9. The user's actual position becomes:
   - $3,750 collateral.
   - $2,500 total borrows.
   - Real LTV = 66.67%, which is healthy.
10. But the protocol still records $5,000 debt (phantom + real), resulting in a calculated LTV of 133.3%.
11. A liquidator initiates liquidation for the $2,500 DAI borrow on Chain A, citing 133.3% LTV.
12. The protocol approves the liquidation based on the incorrect total debt.
13. An additional $2,500 worth of ETH is seized from the user.
14. The liquidator profits from this unjust liquidation, and the user's position is unfairly liquidated despite being healthy.


### Impact

- The protocol incorrectly maintains that the user has an active borrow even after liquidation.
- This allows liquidations of the users other borrow posistions, enabling liquidators to seize all of the user’s collateral.


### PoC

_No response provided._

### Mitigation

Update the `_handleLiquidationExecute()` function to clear or reduce the user's borrow in the `crossChainBorrows` mapping after a successful liquidation.
