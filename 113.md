# User will remove same-chain debt token by repaying its fully cross-chain debt

### Summary

Incorrect borrow asset removal in cross-chain repayments will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as a borrower will repay their full cross-chain debt to clear their same-chain debt.

### Root Cause

When the user repays a cross-chain debt by calling `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` in one chain if the user has debt in that same chain but initiated from the same chain, a call to `lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset()` is made which will remove the same-chain debt token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an existing same-chain borrow position of an amount (e.g., 1000 tokens) in chain B
2. User needs to initiate a cross-chain borrow of an amount (e.g., 100 tokens) in chain B using collateral from chain A
3. Both borrows need to be for the same underlying token

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **User supply assets in chain A and in chain B**
2. **User borrows 1000 tokens on chain B** by calling `CoreRouter::borrow()` with `_amount = 1000` and `_token = USDC`
3. **User initiates cross-chain borrow of 100 tokens** on chain B from collateral on chain A through the cross-chain router on chain A
4. **User repays the cross-chain debt fully** by calling repay `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` with `_amount = 100` on chain B
5. **The system incorrectly removes the USDC token from the list of debt tokens on chain B** so now the user has no debt in chain B

### Impact

The protocol suffers a direct loss equal to the same-chain borrowed amount that gets incorrectly removed. The attacker gains the unpaid debt amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The function should not call `lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset()`
