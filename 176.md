# LEND Accruals Not Reset After Claim

### Summary

The missing accrual reset in CoreRouter's claimLend function will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as an attacker will repeatedly claim the same accrued LEND rewards without having their accrual balance reset

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol:402](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L402)  there is a missing reset of the user's lendAccrued value after transferring tokens to the user. The function calls grantLendInternal() to transfer tokens but never updates the storage to reflect that the rewards have been claimed . 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1 - User needs to have legitimate LEND rewards accrued at least once through staking or borrowing

2- CoreRouter contract needs to have LEND tokens in its balance to be at least equal to the accrued rewards

3- The LEND rewards distribution system to be functioning normally

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1- Attacker stakes or borrows to accrue a legitimate amount of LEND rewards

2- Attacker calls coreRouter.claimLend([attacker], [lToken], true, true) to claim their accrued LEND rewards

3- LEND tokens are transferred to the attacker via grantLendInternal() but lendAccrued[attacker] is never reset to 0

4- Attacker repeatedly calls claimLend() with the same parameters

5- Each call transfers the same amount of LEND tokens to the attacker

6 -Attacker continues until the CoreRouter's LEND balance is drained

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete loss of all LEND token reserves allocated for rewards. The attacker gains multiple times their entitled rewards without providing additional value to the protocol

            attackerBalanceAfterSecondClaim,
            attackerBalanceAfterFirstClaim * 2,

        );
        
        // Repeat multiple times to drain the contract
        for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            coreRouter.claimLend(holders, lTokens, true, true);
        }
        
        // Verify that the attacker has drained a significant amount
        uint256 finalRouterBalance = IERC20(lendToken).balanceOf(address(coreRouter));
        assertLt(
            finalRouterBalance,
            initialRouterBalance / 2,
            "Router should have lost a significant amount of LEND tokens"
        );
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

After transferring LEND tokens to the user in the claimLend function, add a line to reset the accrued balance :

```solidity
function claimLend(address[] memory holders, LToken[] memory lTokens, bool borrowers, bool suppliers) external {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
        uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
        if (accrued > 0) {
            grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
            // Add this line to reset the accrued balance
            lendStorage.resetLendAccrued(holders[j]);
        }
        unchecked {
            ++j;
        }
    }
}
```
