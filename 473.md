# Users can initiate borrows that exceed market's available liquidity

### Summary

Missing market liquidity validation in the `CoreRouter::borrow` function will cause failed transactions and potential DOS as users can attempt to borrow more tokens than actually available in the market.

### Root Cause

 In `CoreRouter.sol` contract, the [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145C5-L190C6) function does not check if the market has sufficient available tokens (cash) before processing the borrow request, which is a core check in Compound V2.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Market must have less available tokens than user wants to borrow
2. User must have sufficient collateral to borrow requested amount
3. User must call borrow() function

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Market has 100 tokens available
2. User has sufficient collateral to borrow 200 tokens
3. User calls borrow(200)
4. Collateral check passes
5. Transaction proceeds to actual borrow
6. Borrow fails due to insufficient market liquidity
7. Gas is wasted and user operation fails

### Impact

- Users waste gas on transactions that will inevitably fail
- Potential DOS on the borrow function when market liquidity is low

### PoC

Add market liquidity check before proceeding with borrow:
```diff
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ...
    
+    uint256 marketCash = LTokenInterface(_lToken).getCash();
+    require(_amount <= marketCash, "Insufficient market liquidity");
    
    // ... 
}
```
