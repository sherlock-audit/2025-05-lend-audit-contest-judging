# Cross-Chain Borrow Allows Bypassing Collateral Limits via Missing Source Chain Borrow Check

### Summary

During cross-chain borrowing, the destination chain only checks collateral against the new borrow plus existing borrows on that chain, ignoring any already borrowed amounts on the source chain. This enables users to double borrow against the same collateral, violating loan-to-value (LTV) rules and putting protocol funds at risk.


### Root Cause

When user requests cross chain borrow, collateral amount and new borrow request amount is sent.


```solidity

function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
        ...
        // Get current collateral amount for the LayerZero message
        // This will be used on dest chain to check if sufficient
        (, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
            collateral,
            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
    }
```

When processing this request on destination  _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest only checks destination borrow against collateral. totalBorrowed only considers borrow state on the destination chain. It does not include any outstanding borrow amounts from the source chain. 

```solidity
    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        ...

        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );

        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

```

As a result, users can:
- Borrow X amount on source chain
- Then request to borrow Y amount on destination chain
- If X + Y > collateral, this would be invalid — but the system accepts it because Y <= collateral is still true individually

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits $1,000 worth of collateral on Chain A
2. Borrows $700 on Chain A
3. Initiates borrowCrossChain() to Chain B, requesting another $700
4. Only Chain B’s borrow state is considered — which has no borrow yet
5. Since $700 <= $1,000 collateral, the borrow is approved again
6. Attacker ends up with $1,400 borrowed against $1,000 collateral

### Impact

The protocol becomes under-collateralized
Users can exceed their allowed borrow limits 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Perform a comprehensive collateral check against all existing borrow positions, not just the local ones
