# Inconsistent Behavior During The Finalization of The Cross-Chain Liquidation

### Summary
In the current cross-chain liquidation process, if the seize operation succeeds on chainA (the source chain), the underlying tokens are transferred to the liquidator, and repayment is executed on chainB (the destination chain). However, if the seize fails, the underlying tokens are transferred from the contract to the liquidator on chainB.

The current design is intended to escrow the liquidator's funds before liquidation begins. However, since the repayment requires funds from the liquidator again, this can lead to scenarios where the repayment fails, or additional funds may be received from the liquidator and locked into the contract.

In the cross-chain liquidation, new `repayCrossChainLiquidation` function should be utilized instead of current `CoreRouter::repayCrossChainLiquidation` function. This function can only use when cross-chain repay.

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is the inconsistent behavior during the finalization of the liquidation in chainB, depending on whether the seize operation succeeds or fails in chainA.

```solidity
     * @dev - Received on Chain A.
475: * - The tokens are escrowed in this contract, return them back to the liquidator
     * - These tokens are the underlying tokens of payload.destlToken
     */
    function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```
As seen in line 475, according to the design, the tokens should be escrowed in this contract. When the seize fails in chainA, the escrowed underlying tokens are transferred back to the liquidator.

        external
    {
        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
        repayBorrowInternal(_borrower, _liquidator, _amount, _lToken, false);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459-L504
```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(
        ...
    ) internal {
        ...

        uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

        // Transfer tokens from the liquidator to the contract
483:    IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);

        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

        // Repay borrowed tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
        ...
    }
```
As seen in line 483 of `CoreRouter`, the actual transfer is executed again when finalizing the liquidation.

### Impact
Even if the seize operation is successful in chainA, the repayment could still fail in chainB. 
This means that even if the liquidated collateral is seized, the liquidatee's debt is not deducted.

### Mitigation
Consider escrowing funds from the liquidator before the liquidation process begins and avoid transferring funds from the liquidator during the cross-chain repayment.
