# Cross-chain repayments cause incorrect same-chain borrow balance updates

### Summary

The repayment logic improperly updates same-chain borrow balances during cross-chain repayments without distinguishing between same-chain and cross-chain borrows. This causes potential underflow errors when partial repayments occur on cross-chain debt or allows simultaneous repayment of both debts.

### Root Cause

The repayment process for cross-chain borrows uses the same internal function as same-chain repayments: `CoreRouter.sol#repayBorrowInternal()`, with the `_isSameChain` input bool set to false to indicate cross-chain. This bool controls which borrow amount calculation function is called: `borrowWithInterestSame` for same-chain and `borrowWithInterest` for cross-chain. However, at the end of the function, the code always updates the same-chain borrow balances without checking the value of `_isSameChain`. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L493). As a result, cross-chain repayments incorrectly modify same-chain debt state, causing potential underflows and incorrect debt accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The malicious user takes out a borrow on the same chain (same-chain borrow).

2. The user also takes out a cross-chain borrow (cross-chain borrow).

3. When repaying cross-chain, `repayBorrowInternal()` is called with `_isSameChain` set to false.

4. Despite `_isSameChain` being false, the function updates the same-chain borrow balance without checking the bool.

5. This allows the user to repay both same-chain and cross-chain debt simultaneously via a cross-chain repayment transaction, bypassing intended separation of borrows.

### Impact

A malicious user can exploit this flaw to repay both same-chain and cross-chain borrows simultaneously with a single cross-chain repayment, potentially bypassing intended repayment restrictions. Additionally, a legitimate user who only has cross-chain borrow will be unable to repay partial amounts, as the logic causes underflow or reverts when same-chain borrow is absent.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an explicit check for the `_isSameChain` bool in `CoreRouter.sol#repayBorrowInternal()` at the section updating borrow balances. Ensure that updates to same-chain borrow balances occur only if `_isSameChain` is true, and cross-chain borrow balances are updated separately when `_isSameChain` is false. This will prevent underflows and unintended simultaneous repayments.
