# [M-3] Silent Fund Loss in CoreRouter Due to Unchecked Return Value

## Summary
The CoreRouter contract uses the standard `IERC20.transfer()` function to send tokens (e.g., USDT) to users during operations like `redeem()`, and `borrow()`. Tokens that return false on failure may result in silent fund loss if the return value is not checked properly. This creates a critical risk for user funds and protocol reliability.

## Root Cause
> Missing Return Value Checks: For tokens that **do return `false` on failure**, the contract does not validate the return value of `transfer()`.
```solidity
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
If `transfer()` returns `false`, the transaction continues silently, leading to **undetected fund loss**.

---
## Impact
> Bob borrows DAI, but the DAI contract returns `false` during `transfer()` due to a locked balance.
> `CoreRouter` does **not check the return value**, assuming the transfer succeeded.
- Bob’s transaction completes successfully, but he receives **no tokens**.
- Funds remain in the contract, and the user’s financial info, for example debt, is still recorded in the `updateTotalInvestment()`

## Mitigation
Add a return check and replace transfer() with SafeERC20.safeTransfer() to handle non-compliant tokens
