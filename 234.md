# Any user will drain all ETH and disable cross-chain messaging

## Summary
`_send` passing `MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0)` without cost to caller will cause a complete loss of the router’s ETH and block all cross-chain operations for the protocol as **any user** can repeatedly call cheap public functions that trigger `_send` with zero `msg.value`.

## Root Cause
- **In [`src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol:817-820`](src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L817-L820)** `_send` forwards the **entire contract balance** as the native fee via `MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0)`.
- **In [`lib/LayerZero-v2/.../OAppSender.sol:103`](lib/LayerZero-v2/packages/layerzero-v2/evm/oapp/contracts/oapp/OAppSender.sol#L103)** `_payNative` only checks that the contract holds enough ETH and does *not* require the caller to provide it (`msg.value` can be zero).

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Router contract balance `> 0` (e.g. funded by protocol or previous operations).

## External Pre-conditions
None.

## Attack Path
1. Attacker calls `borrowCrossChain(1, validToken, someEid)` (or any other public function that leads to `_send`) with `msg.value = 0`.
2. Inside `_send`, the contract sends **all** of its ETH to the LayerZero endpoint as `nativeFee`.
3. Endpoint keeps the true fee `F` and refunds the surplus; net loss per call = `F`.
4. Repeat the call until router balance == 0.

## Impact
The **protocol** loses its entire ETH balance (≈ router balance) and subsequently all cross-chain actions revert with `NotEnoughNative`, effectively **DoS**-ing the system. The attacker gains no funds (griefing).

## PoC
 

## Mitigation
- Quote the exact fee with `endpoint.quote()` and pass that value instead of `address(this).balance`.
- Revert in `_payNative` when `msg.value != _nativeFee`; force caller to supply the fee.
- Add sensible minimum amounts / liquidity checks before emitting cross-chain messages.
