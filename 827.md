# Borrowe health is not properly checked during redemption

### Summary

During redemption, there is a check to ensure that the user's position is still properly collateralised, however at the end of the redemption, the check is not enforced to ensure that the user's position is still healthy, hence if a user user redeems their collateral below their borrowed amount, their position could become immediately liquidatable. Hence users are not protected.

### Root Cause

As seen below, the check is only performed before the actual redemption takes place, but is not done at the end of the function also.

```sol
File: Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol
100:     function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
101:         // Redeem lTokens
102:         address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);
103: 
104:         require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");
105: 
106:         // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
107:         require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
108: 
109:         // Check liquidity
110:         (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
111:    @>       lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
112:    @>   require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity"); // @audit position does not recalculate this and compare after redemption 

```
Hence if the amount redeemed during the call makes the position become undercollateralised, the position can become unhealthy immediately

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

There is not attack path as this is owing to a missing business logic implementation

### Impact

User's position can become unhealthy after a redemption

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider evaluating the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` at the end of the [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L112) function and checking the health of the position
