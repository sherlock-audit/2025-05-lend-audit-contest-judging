# a type mismatch issue in the function borrowCrossChain.

### Summary

  mapping(address underlying => mapping(uint256 destId => address destlToken)) public underlyingToDestlToken;
  function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable
lendStorage.underlyingToDestlToken is a mapping, and it's indexed by a uint256 for the destEid.
But logically, this could be a potential source of bugs or inconsistencies if:

Other parts of your contract or storage system treat destEid consistently as uint256, and

You truncate the ID (from uint256 to uint32) elsewhere in your logic or external systems

### Root Cause

[CrosschainRouter 113]
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113)
 address destLToken = lendStorage.underlyingToDestlToken(_borrowToken, _destEid);

### Internal Pre-conditions

That key is 2^32, which does not fit into a uint32 â€” it gets truncated to 0 when cast down to uint32.
borrowCrossChain(..., _destEid = 0);


### External Pre-conditions

If an attacker controls or manipulates lendStorage, or can influence mapping values, they may:




### Attack Path

Insert malicious tokens using high destEid values.

Confuse the system by creating multiple entries that appear distinct in the storage mapping, but cannot be accessed safely via this function due to the uint32 cap.


### Impact

more gas fee used and misunderstanding in function call

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

    mapping(address underlying => mapping(uint256 destId => address destlToken)) public underlyingToDestlToken;
// after fixing  
mapping(address underlying => mapping(uint32 destId => address destlToken)) public underlyingToDestlToken;
