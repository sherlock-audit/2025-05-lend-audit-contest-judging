# Double Interest Calculation Causes Premature Liquidations

### Summary

Double interest calculation during liquidation validation will cause premature liquidations for borrowers as liquidators will exploit the inflated debt validation to liquidate positions that should still be healthy and safe.


### Root Cause

The issue occurs due to double interest calculation during liquidation validation.

**Step 1: First interest calculation in [borrowWithInterestSame](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L509-L515) function**



```solidity
// In LendStorage.sol - borrowWithInterestSame function
function borrowWithInterestSame(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 borrowIndex = borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].borrowIndex;
    uint256 borrowBalanceSameChain = borrowIndex != 0
        ? (borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex())) / borrowIndex
        : 0;
    return borrowBalanceSameChain;
}
```

**Step 2: Second interest calculation in [liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347-L348)**

```solidity
// In CoreRouter.sol - liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

// Uses the ALREADY CALCULATED borrowed amount from Step 1 and applies interest AGAIN
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

The problem: `borrowed` from Step 1 already has interest applied (principal × currentIndex/userIndex), but Step 2 applies the same interest calculation again using the same stored `borrowBalance.borrowIndex`, creating a double-compounded debt amount used for liquidation validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an outstanding borrow position with `borrowBalance.borrowIndex` set to a value less than the current global `borrowIndex`
2. User's position needs to be eligible for liquidation (either underwater with `borrowedAmount > collateral` or in a deprecated market)
3. Time needs to have passed since the user's last interaction to allow interest to accrue on the position

### External Pre-conditions

None required - this is purely an internal accounting error.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator identifies a borrower with an accrued interest position that appears liquidatable due to inflated validation
2. Liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow(borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, borrowedAsset)`
3. The function executes `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` which calculates interest once: `borrowed = principal × (currentIndex/userIndex)`
4. The function then executes `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` which applies interest again: `borrowedAmount = borrowed × (currentIndex/userIndex)` 
5. The inflated `borrowedAmount` is used to validate if liquidation is allowed (`borrowedAmount > collateral`)
6. The same inflated amount affects seize token calculations, allowing more collateral to be seized
7. The borrower gets liquidated prematurely when their position should still be healthy
8. The actual repayment uses the correct debt amount, but the borrower has already lost excessive collateral

### Impact

Borrowers suffer premature liquidations when their positions should still be healthy and safe. Using the inflated debt amount for validation means users get liquidated earlier than intended by the protocol design. Additionally, the seize token calculation uses the inflated amount, causing borrowers to lose more collateral than justified by their actual debt. If interest has accrued 20% since last update, a position with collateral ratio of 130% (safe) could appear as 111% (liquidatable) due to the 44% debt inflation, triggering premature liquidation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the borrower's index before performing liquidation calculations by calling `updateBorrowBalance()` at the beginning of `liquidateBorrow()` or 
Implement a state management pattern where interest is calculated once per transaction and cached, preventing multiple calculations on the same position within a single transaction.
