# Incorrect Order of Operations in Reward Distribution Leads to Over/Under-Rewarding During Liquidations



## Description

The protocol has a critical issue in reward distribution during liquidations and repayments. Rewards are calculated and distributed based on **old balances** before the actual balance updates occur, leading to incorrect reward allocations.
**Root Cause:**
The issue stems from the order of operations in two key functions:

1. **`repayBorrowInternal()`**: Calls `distributeBorrowerLend()` before updating the borrower's debt balance
```solidity
// filepath: src/CoreRouter.sol
function repayBorrowInternal(
    uint256 repayAmount,
    address _lToken,
    address borrower
) internal {
    uint256 borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
    // ...

    // ❌ PROBLEM: Rewards distributed based on old (higher) debt amount
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

    // Actual debt reduction happens after rewards
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
    lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
        borrower,
        _lToken,
        borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal,
        block.timestamp
    );
}
```
2. **`liquidateSeizeUpdate()`**: Calls `distributeSupplierLend()` before updating collateral balances (`totalInvestment`)
```solidity
// filepath: src/CoreRouter.sol
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
    address lTokenCollateral,
    address borrower,
    address sender,
    uint256 seizeTokens
) internal {
    // ❌ PROBLEM: Rewards distributed based on old balances
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, sender);     // Liquidator gets 0 rewards
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, borrower);   // Borrower gets rewards on lost collateral

    // Balance updates happen after rewards
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral, 
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) - seizeTokens);
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + seizeTokens);
}
```

Rewards are calculated as following

```solidity
// filepath: src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol
function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external {
    uint256 borrowerIndex = lendBorrowerIndex[lToken][borrower];
    uint256 borrowBalance = borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken);

    // ❌ PROBLEM: Uses old borrow balance before repayment/liquidation
    uint256 borrowerDelta = borrowBalance * (marketBorrowIndex[lToken] - borrowerIndex) / 1e36;
    lendAccrued[borrower] += borrowerDelta;
}

function distributeSupplierLend(address lToken, address supplier) external {
    uint256 supplyIndex = lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier];
    uint256 supplierTokens = totalInvestment[supplier][lToken];

    // ❌ PROBLEM: Uses old collateral balance before seizure
    uint256 supplierDelta = supplierTokens * (marketSupplyIndex[lToken] - supplyIndex) / 1e36;
    lendAccrued[supplier] += supplierDelta;
}
```

**Impact on Liquidations:**
During liquidation, the following problematic sequence occurs:
1. `liquidateBorrow()` calls `repayBorrowInternal()`
2. `repayBorrowInternal()` distributes borrower rewards based on **old (higher) debt amount**
3. Debt balance is updated (reduced)
4. `liquidateSeizeUpdate()` distributes supplier rewards based on **old collateral balances**
5. Collateral balances are finally updated (seizure occurs)

**Specific Problems:**
- **Borrowers are over-rewarded**: They receive LEND tokens calculated on debt they've already repaid
- **Borrowers receive double rewards**: They get supplier rewards on collateral they're about to lose
- **Liquidators are under-rewarded**: They receive no rewards on newly seized collateral since their balance is still zero during distribution

  THE PROBLEM:
  Because reward distribution happens BEFORE balance updates:
  1. Borrower got rewards based on their OLD (higher) debt amount
  2. Borrower got rewards based on their OLD (higher) collateral amount
  3. Liquidator got rewards based on their OLD (zero) collateral amount
  
  This means:
  - Borrowers are over-rewarded for debt they no longer have
  - Borrowers are over-rewarded for collateral they no longer have
  - Liquidators are under-rewarded for collateral they now have
  
  CORRECT ORDER SHOULD BE:
  1. Update borrow balance FIRST
  2. THEN distribute borrower rewards based on NEW balance
  3. Update collateral balances FIRST
  4. THEN distribute supplier rewards based on NEW balances
```

We can indeed see that before balance updates, rewards are calculated on OLD balances, not NEW balances. This is why the borrower gets rewards on debt they've already repaid and collateral they've already lost, while the liquidator gets NO rewards on newly seized collateral. The correct order should be to update borrow balance first, then distribute borrower rewards based on NEW balance, and then update collateral balances first, then:


In liquidateSeizeUpdate(), the supply-side reward distribution happens before the borrower’s collateral is actually removed and before the liquidator’s new position is recorded—so:
– the borrower gets rewards on collateral they’ve just lost,
– the liquidator gets no rewards on the tokens they’ve just seized.


## Mitigation


**Primary Solution: Reorder Operations**

The core fix is to update balances **before** distributing rewards. This ensures reward calculations are based on accurate, post-transaction balances.

### 1. Fix `repayBorrowInternal()` in CoreRouter.sol

**Current problematic order:**
```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(...) internal {
    // ... setup code ...
    
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);  // ❌ BEFORE balance update
    
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
    
    // Update borrow balances
    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, ...);
    }
}
```

**Fixed order:**
```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(...) internal {
    // ... setup code ...
    
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
    
    // Update borrow balances FIRST
    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, ...);
    }
    
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);  // ✅ AFTER balance update
}
```

### 2. Fix `liquidateSeizeUpdate()` in CoreRouter.sol

**Current problematic order:**
```solidity
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(...) internal {
    // ... calculate seizeTokens ...
    
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, sender);     // ❌ BEFORE balance update
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, borrower);   // ❌ BEFORE balance update
    
    // Update total investment
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral, ...);
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral, ...);
}
```

**Fixed order:**
```solidity
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(...) internal {
    // ... calculate seizeTokens ...
    
    // Update total investment FIRST
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral, 
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) - seizeTokens);
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral, 
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward));
    
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, sender);     // ✅ AFTER balance update
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, borrower);   // ✅ AFTER balance update
}
```
