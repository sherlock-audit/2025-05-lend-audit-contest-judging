# Token decimals mismatch between chains causes severe accounting errors

### Summary

The protocol fails to normalize token decimal places between different chains, causing massive accounting discrepancies in cross-chain borrows.

### Root Cause

The cross-chain borrowing flow directly passes amounts between chains without accounting for different decimal places:

1. [`borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L145) sends the raw amount in the LayerZero message
2. [`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L625) uses the amount [directly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L202-L204) on the destination chain
3. [`_handleValidBorrowRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L722) records the same raw amount as debt on the source chain

It is worth noting that no decimal normalization occurs anywhere in this flow.

However, the same token can have different decimal precision on different chains (e.g., USDC has 6 decimals on Ethereum but 18 decimals on BSC), leading to either transaction reverts or severe under-recording of debt amounts. A full list of such tokens can be found [here](https://github.com/magnetto90/tokens-decimals).

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

**Scenario 1: Transaction Reverts (DoS)**
1. User has collateral on BSC and wants to borrow USDC on Ethereum
2. User specifies amount using BSC decimals: 10 USDC = 10 * 1e18
3. LayerZero message sends amount `10e18` to Ethereum
4. Ethereum tries to borrow `10e18` USDC (10 trillion USDC due to 6 decimal precision)
5. Transaction reverts due to insufficient protocol liquidity
6. **Result**: Legitimate cross-chain borrowing becomes impossible

**Scenario 2: Massive Debt Under-Recording**
1. User has $1000 collateral on BSC  
2. User borrows 800 USDC on Ethereum using Ethereum decimals: 800e6
3. Ethereum processes successfully, user receives 800 USDC ($800 value)
4. Success message returns amount `800e6` to BSC
5. BSC records debt as `800e6` but BSC USDC uses 18 decimals
6. On BSC: 800e6 = 0.0000000008 USDC (essentially $0.0000008)
7. **Result**: User borrowed $800 but only has $0.0000008 recorded debt

### Impact

Protocol insolvency risk through massive accounting errors:

1. Users can borrow substantial real value while recording negligible debt amounts, thus stealing from the protocol
2. Protocol's cross-chain debt tracking becomes completely inaccurate  
3. Liquidation mechanisms may fail due to incorrect debt calculations
4. Protocol faces potential insolvency as real debt exceeds recorded amounts
5. DoS of legitimate cross-chain borrowing operations

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Implement decimal normalization for cross-chain token amounts. Before sending LayerZero messages, convert amounts to a standard precision (e.g., 18 decimals), then convert back to destination chain precision when executing operations. Maintain mapping of token decimal places per chain for accurate conversions.
