# Max Close Calculation in Liquidation Ignores Interest

## Summary
The protocol incorrectly calculates the maximum repayable amount (max close) during liquidation by using only the principal (stored borrow balance) and ignoring accrued interest. As a result, liquidators are unable to repay the intended fraction (closeFactor) of a borrower's total debt, especially when significant interest has accrued. This reduces liquidation efficiency, risks protocol solvency, and creates inconsistencies between eligibility and execution of liquidations.

## Root Cause
In [CoreRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-Sparrow-23/blob/471749b3043a3eca36d78e6d1b3a77aef72a536e/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L353-L358), the liquidation permission check calculates the maximum repayable amount as:

```solidity
uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
    Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
);
require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
```

Here, `borrowBalance.amount` is the principal only. The borrower's actual debt (principal + interest) is higher after interest accrual, but maxClose does not account for this. As a result, the function reverts if a liquidator attempts to repay closeFactor × (principal + interest), even though this should be allowed.

## Internal pre-conditions
1. A borrower has an outstanding loan and has accrued interest over time
2. The borrower's position is eligible for liquidation (shortfall exists)
3. The protocol's closeFactor is set to a value less than 1e18 (e.g., 0.5e18 for 50%)

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. A user borrows 100 tokens as principal
2. Time passes; interest accrues, so the user's debt is now 200 tokens (principal + interest)
3. A liquidator attempts to repay 50% of the total debt (100 tokens)
4. The protocol only allows 50% of the principal (50 tokens) to be repaid due to the flawed maxClose calculation
5. The liquidation reverts with "Too much repay" and the unhealthy position persists

## Impact
1. Liquidators cannot efficiently reduce protocol risk by repaying the intended fraction of bad debt
2. Underwater positions may persist longer, increasing insolvency risk
3. The protocol's liquidation mechanism is inconsistent and less effective as interest accrues
4. Users and liquidators may lose trust in the protocol's risk management
## Recommended Fix
Update the maxClose calculation to use the borrower's total debt (principal + interest) instead of just the principal. This ensures liquidators can always repay up to closeFactor × total debt, as intended.
