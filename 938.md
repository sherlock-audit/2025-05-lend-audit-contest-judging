# Incorrect Liquidity Calculation in getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral

### Summary

A logical error in the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function incorrectly accounts for redeemed collateral by artificially inflating the borrow value instead of reducing collateral. This leads to incorrect liquidity checks, potentially allowing undercollateralized positions to go undetected.

### Root Cause

The function adds the value of redeemed tokens to `sumBorrowPlusEffects` (borrow side) instead of deducting it from `sumCollateral`. This misrepresents the economic effect of redemptions, causing:

Overstated liquidity (redeeming reduces collateral but the system treats it as additional debt).

Risk of undercollateralized positions not being liquidated properly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The function is called when checking account liquidity (e.g., before borrowing or redeeming).

2. The redeemTokens parameter is > 0 (user is redeeming collateral).

3. The lTokenModify is a valid collateral asset.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits 100 USDC (collateral value = 80 USD at 0.8 factor).

2. Borrows 50 USDC (borrow value = 50 USD).

* Liquidity: 80 - 50 = +30 (safe).

3. Redeems 38 USDC (worth 30 USD after collateral factor).

* Expected Behavior:

- Collateral drops to 80 - 30= 50 USD.


* Buggy Behavior:

Collateral remains 80 USD.

Borrows increase to 50 + 30 = 80 USD.

The safety check passed


And new collateral will be 100 - 38 = 62

and borrow will be 50


### Impact

Risk Classification: Medium (economic distortion, but no direct fund loss).



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correctly subtract the redeemed token value from sumCollateral instead of adding it to sumBorrowPlusEffects to ensure accurate liquidity calculations.
