# User can borrow amount which is greater than 0 such as literally one wei of a token, which will be not profitable to liquidate

### Summary

A malicious user can create tons of small positions which are literally 1/100th of a cent, he can call `supply()` and provide an amount worth let's say $0.1 and then borrow $0.095 and even if the collateral goes below the collateralization ratio, liquidation is unprofitable for the liquidator as he'll pay much, much more in gas fees, given that the protocol will be deployed on ETH chain.

### Root Cause

No minimum amount of borrowing to prevent that

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Explained in summary

### Impact

Worsening of protocol's health and creating unfavorable positions for liquidation - medium severity

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a minimum amount such as $100 or make the user pay a gas compensation fee as in other similar protocols
