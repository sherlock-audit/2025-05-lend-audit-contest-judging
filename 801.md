# Incorrect placement of `distributeSupplierLend` in `redeem` function

## Summary
The invocation of `distributeSupplierLend` after `redeem` in the CoreRouter `redeem` function will cause an incorrect distribution of LEND tokens for users or the protocol as the `supplyIndex` is updated based on a modified `totalSupply`, affecting reward calculations.

## Root Cause
In `Router.sol` within the `redeem` function, `lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend` is called after `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem`, which reduces the lToken’s `totalSupply`, causing `updateLendSupplyIndex` to calculate an incorrect `supplyIndex`.

**Note:** This is basically a conceptual error in many places in the code where rewards are accrued after the state of the data that affects rewards has changed. The accruing LEND functions should be called just like accrueInterest at the beginning of the function, before the changes.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The lToken pool needs to have a non-zero `lendSupplySpeeds` to distribute LEND rewards.
2. The lToken pool needs to have no interactions (e.g., `mint`, `borrow`, `redeem`) for several hours to accumulate significant LEND rewards.
3. The user needs to hold a substantial amount of lTokens (e.g., equivalent to $10,000 or more) to ensure the LEND reward difference is significant.
4. The LEND token needs to have a measurable market value (e.g., at least $0.01 per LEND).

## External Pre-conditions
1. The underlying token’s price (e.g., USDC) needs to remain stable to ensure the loss is measurable in USD terms.
2. The oracle price feed for the lToken’s underlying asset needs to be consistent to avoid unrelated reverts.

## Attack Path
1. A user calls `redeem` on the Router contract with a significant amount of lTokens (e.g., 1,000,000 cUSDC, worth $24,500).
2. The Router executes `redeem` on the lToken, reducing `totalSupply` (e.g., by 1,000,000 cUSDC).
3. The Router calls `distributeSupplierLend`, which triggers `updateLendSupplyIndex`.
4. `updateLendSupplyIndex` calculates `supplyIndex` using the reduced `totalSupply`, resulting in a higher `ratio` (LEND per lToken).
5. The user receives more LEND than entitled for the period before `redeem`, based on the inflated `supplyIndex`.
6. Future users receive fewer LEND due to the skewed `supplyIndex`, or the protocol distributes excess LEND, incurring a loss.

## Impact
The user may suffer an approximate loss of LEND rewards if the `supplyIndex` is not updated correctly, or the protocol suffers a loss by distributing excess LEND (e.g., >$10 worth of LEND for large `redeem` operations). The affected party (user or protocol) experiences a loss exceeding 0.01% of their principal or reward allocation.

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy an lToken pool (e.g., cUSDC) with a `lendSupplySpeeds` set to distribute significant LEND rewards (e.g., 1 LEND per block).
- Allow the pool to remain inactive for several hours, accumulating LEND rewards.
- A user with 1,000,000 cUSDC (worth $24,500) calls `redeem` on the Router.
- The Router executes `redeem`, reducing `totalSupply` by 1,000,000 cUSDC.
- The Router calls `distributeSupplierLend`, which updates `supplyIndex` using the lower `totalSupply`, increasing the `ratio` of LEND per lToken.
- The user receives excess LEND (e.g., 100 LEND instead of 90 LEND, worth $10 at $0.1 per LEND) for the period before `redeem`.
- The protocol loses $10 worth of LEND, and future reward distributions are skewed, affecting other users.

## Mitigation
Move the `lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend` call before the `redeem` operation in the `redeem` function to ensure `supplyIndex` is updated based on the pre-redeem `totalSupply`. Example:
```solidity
lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
```
