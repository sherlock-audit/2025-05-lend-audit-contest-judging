# Liquidator Also Could Become Liquidatable

### Summary
In the same-chain liquidation process, the liquidator seizes the liquidatee's collateral. However, this collateral is not added to the liquidator's supplied asset list. 

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is that during the liquidation process, the seized asset from the liquidatee is not registered under the liquidator's account.

```solidity
398:    for (uint256 i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length;) {
```
As seen in the link above, when calculating a user's total collateral, it iterates over `userSuppliedAssets`.

```solidity
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
        external
    {
        ...
241:    liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }
```

```solidity

        ...
    ) internal {
        ...
275:    liquidateSeizeUpdate(msg.sender, borrower, lTokenCollateral, borrowedlToken, repayAmount);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L278-L318
```solidity
    function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
        address sender,
        address borrower,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address borrowedlToken,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) internal {
        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
            .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");

        // Revert if borrower collateral token balance < seizeTokens
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) >= seizeTokens, "Insufficient collateral");

        uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

        // Just for safety, Never gonna occur
        if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
            currentReward = 0;
        }

        // Update protocol reward
        lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);

        // Distribute rewards
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, sender);
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, borrower);

        // Update total investment
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            borrower, lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) - seizeTokens
        );
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            sender,
            lTokenCollateral,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward)
        );

        // Emit LiquidateBorrow event
        emit LiquidateBorrow(sender, borrowedlToken, borrower, lTokenCollateral);
    }
```
As seen, even if the total investments are updated, the lists are not updated for both the liquidator and borrower. The missing deletion is not problematic; however, the missing addition is problematic.

Consider the following scenario involving Alice and Bob:
USDC, USDT's collateral factor are all 0.8
1. Alice has 100 USDT and 70 USDC of debt in this contract.
2. Alice's debt increases to 90 USDC.
3. Bob has 1000 USDC and 790 DAI of debt in this contract.
4. Bob repays 45 USDC(from exteral wallet) of Alice's debt and seizes 48 USDT.
   At this point, Bob has: 1000 USDC, 48 USDT and 790 DAI of debt.
   However, since USDT is not registered to Bob's supplied asset list, his collateral is calculated to be only 1000 USDC, and his debt remains 790 DAI.
5. Bob's debt increases to 810 USDC.
   But since Bob has seized 48 USDT, he does not add any asset.
   As a result, Bob becomes liquidatable and risks losing funds.

### Impact
Even if the liquidator has collateral in this contract, they do not receive rewards (e.g., LEND). 
Additionally, even if the liquidator has enough collateral, they could still become liquidatable.

### Mitigation
