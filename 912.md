# The reward mechanism in liquidation is flawed

### Summary

During liquidation, the liquidator gets the mantissa fee/reward for his participation and compensation in the system, but currently there are two problems, the first problem is that the CR of the protocol is 100% + close mantissa factor

Second issue is that the reward is not decremented as seen in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L292) where it is created and nowhere it is decremented [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L310-L314) from the borrower.

It is decremented from the liquidator balance, leaving him with zero incentive to actually liquidate as he'll get less funds than he has given.

### Root Cause

Flawed reward mechanism in regards to compensating the liquidator as first, liquidation can happen only when the CR is undercollateralized as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L350), plus the reward will be decremented from the sender (liquidator) so there's even a negative incentive to liquidate positions

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User creates a debt via borrowing $950 from $1000
2. Collateral falls to below cr
3. Liquidator sees that, but if he liquidates, he'll be at a loss due to aforementioned reasons in summary and root cause

### Impact

Zero incentive to liquidate any positions, leaving the protocol with bad debt
