# Users can supply tokens via `supply()` in order to get reward from `distributeSupplierLend()` without contributing

### Summary

Users can freely `supply()` as much as they want and then claim reward without providing any value to the system, as they can take no debt and just have their money sit in the protocol and later claim the LEND rewards just like that

### Root Cause

Flawed reward mechanism that gives LEND rewards to non-contributing users that just `supply()` and do nothing else in the protocol

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions
