# Users will lose LayerZero fees due to incorrect refund address configuration

### Summary

Incorrect refund address configuration in cross-chain messaging will cause users to lose their LayerZero fees as the protocol sets itself as the fee receiver instead of the transaction initiator.

### Root Cause

In CrossChainRouter.sol:_send() the protocol sets [payable(address(this))](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) as the refund address for LayerZero fees instead of the user, causing all excess fees to be sent to the protocol rather than refunded to users
```solidity
_lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User calls borrowCrossChain() with 0.1 ETH for LayerZero fees
2. LayerZero only uses 0.08 ETH for the cross-chain message
3. The remaining 0.02 ETH is refunded to the protocol instead of the user
4. User loses the excess fees they paid

### Impact

Users lose any excess LayerZero fees they paid as these are refunded to the protocol instead of the original sender. This creates an unfair cost burden on users performing cross-chain operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify _send() function to use the user's address as the refund address
