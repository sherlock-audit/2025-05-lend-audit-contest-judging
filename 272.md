# Incorrect Borrow Authorization via Zero borrowIndex

### Summary

The `borrow()` function allows a user to borrow assets even when they have no recorded previous borrow (i.e., `borrowIndex == 0`) and potentially zero collateral, due to flawed logic in checking borrow eligibility.

### Root Cause

In [`borrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145) function, the borrower's current borrow balance is calculated with:

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;
```
If `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0`, then `borrowAmount` becomes `0` by default. This causes the following collateral check to pass even with zero collateral:

```solidity
require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
  
Because `borrowAmount == 0`, this check is trivially true when `collateral == 0`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0`
* This implies the user has **no previous borrow record**, or the borrow balance was reset without proper index initialization.

### External Pre-conditions

* The attacker can call `borrow()` with a valid `_token`.
* The contract allows interacting with the selected `_lToken` (i.e., it’s not paused or blacklisted).
* No external validation or override prevents a borrow when `borrowIndex == 0`.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker ensures their `borrowIndex` is `0` (e.g., by never borrowing before).
2. They call `borrow()` for a supported token.
3. Since `borrowAmount == 0`, the system incorrectly considers them fully collateralized.
4. The attacker receives `_amount` tokens directly, even without any collateral.

### Impact

* Attackers can receive borrowed tokens with zero or insufficient collateral.
* If exploited repeatedly or with high-value tokens, this could drain liquidity pools and result in bad debt.

### PoC

The PoC is written in `test/TestBorrowing.t.sol`

```solidity
    function test_that_borrowing_with_no_collateral_reverts() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
@>      (address token, address lToken) = _supply(2e18); // @audit deployer supplied
        address alice = address(0x01);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        // vm.expectRevert();
        coreRouter.borrow(1e18, token); // @audit alice borrows without collateral

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```


### Mitigation


Please change the logic to explicitly validate collateral even in the case of new borrows
```solidity
uint256 effectiveBorrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : borrowed;

require(collateral >= effectiveBorrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
