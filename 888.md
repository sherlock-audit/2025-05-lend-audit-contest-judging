# Account Abstraction Wallets Will Permanently Lose Cross-Chain Assets

## Summary

The protocol's cross-chain messaging system assumes users have identical addresses across all chains, which will cause a permanent loss of assets for account abstraction wallet users as these wallets typically have different addresses on different chains. When users with account abstraction wallets initiate cross-chain borrows or transfers, the assets will be sent to addresses they don't control on the destination chain.

## Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:814-815` the protocol encodes the user's address directly in the cross-chain payload:

```solidity
bytes memory payload =
    abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);
```

And in `CrossChainRouter.sol:751-760` it decodes and uses this address directly on the destination chain:

```solidity
(
    payload.amount,
    payload.borrowIndex,
    payload.collateral,
    payload.sender,
    payload.destlToken,
    payload.liquidator,
    payload.srcToken,
    payload.contractType
) = abi.decode(_payload, (uint256, uint256, uint256, address, address, address, address, uint8));
```

The protocol then transfers tokens directly to this decoded address in `CoreRouter.sol:196-198`:

```solidity
require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
```

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must be using an account abstraction wallet (like Safe/Gnosis, Sequence, Argent, Biconomy, etc.)
2. User must have different addresses on the source and destination chains
3. User must attempt to borrow cross-chain

## External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol must be deployed on multiple chains (Ethereum, Base, BNB, Sonic, Monad)
2. Account abstraction wallets must be supported by the protocol

## Attack Path

1. A user with an account abstraction wallet (address 0xABC... on Chain A and 0xDEF... on Chain B) initiates a cross-chain borrow
2. The protocol sends a LayerZero message with the user's Chain A address (0xABC...) encoded in the payload
3. On Chain B, the protocol decodes the address and attempts to transfer tokens to 0xABC...
4. Since the user's actual address on Chain B is 0xDEF..., the tokens are sent to an address they don't control
5. The borrowed assets are permanently lost as they are sent to an address the user doesn't own on the destination chain

## Impact

Users with account abstraction wallets will permanently lose all borrowed assets when using cross-chain functionality. This affects a significant portion of users, as account abstraction wallets are increasingly common, especially among DeFi users who interact with protocols across multiple chains.

The protocol will suffer reputational damage and potential financial losses as users lose their assets. This issue creates a significant barrier to adoption for users of account abstraction wallets, which represent an increasing share of DeFi users.

## Mitigation

1. Add an explicit recipient field to the user data structure:


2. Provide a function for users to set their recipient address for each destination chain:


3. When building the payload in `_send()`, use the designated recipient address if set:



4. On the destination chain, always transfer tokens to the designated recipient:


This solution maintains backward compatibility for EOA users while allowing account abstraction wallet users to specify the correct address on each chain.
