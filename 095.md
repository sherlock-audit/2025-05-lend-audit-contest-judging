# User can be liquidate due to wrong condition check in `CoreRouter::borrow` function.

### Summary

when any user wants to borrow from the protocol for same asset which they borrowed earlier they call `CoreRouter::borrow` function with desired amout of asset. but the function checks only for previous amount the user borrowed, if the collateral is sufficient in the pool or in the protocol. Which pass the checks for current borrow which can be huge can trigger the liquidation for the user.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter::borrow` function the check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");` will be passed because it only checks for previous borrows for the same asset without including current borrow amount. Which would pass and the function will complet it execution which exeeds the users borrow limit for the collateral which can make user undercollaterize. which trigger liquidation.

```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

@>      require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

### Impact

user can be liquidated due to very huge amount of borrow which exeeds users borrow limit and can be results in health factor break.

### PoC

Here is scenario.

1. user has borrowed some `X` amount before. And in the protocol the liquidity will become: borrowed = `X` and collateral = `Y` (collateral deposited by user).
2. Now suppose there is condition where user wants to borrow very much amount like `Z`.
3. The protocol will pass the checks for previous borrow (Y >= X).

Now user will get that huge amount as debt and if the health factor decrease or liquidation triggers the user will loss their collateral and they have pay fees for the borrowed amout.

### Mitigation

he fucntion should check liquidity including current borrow amount.

```diff
-        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
+        require(collateral >= borrowAmount + _amount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
