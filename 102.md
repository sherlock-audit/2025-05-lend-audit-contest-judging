# Users will lose funds during redemptions due to stale exchange rate calculations

### Summary

CoreRouter using stale exchange rates for redemption calculations will cause systematic fund loss for users as the contract will consistently transfer less underlying tokens than users are entitled to receive from accrued interest.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol:redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L114-L124), the `redeem()` function calculates expected underlying tokens using `exchangeRateStored()` (stale rate) before calling Compound's redeem() operation, but Compound internally uses `exchangeRateCurrent()` (accrued rate) for the actual redemption.
```solidity
// Get exchange rate before redeem
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Calculate expected underlying tokens  
uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

// Perform redeem (this calls accrueInterest() internally!)
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

// Transfer calculated amount, NOT actual amount received
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

Similarly, in [CoreRouter.sol:supply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L73-L80), the supply() function has the same issue with tracking `totalInvestment`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users need to supply tokens to create lToken positions
2. Borrowers need to borrow tokens to generate interest-accruing activity
3. The protocol needs to have active lending/borrowing to create exchange rate changes

### External Pre-conditions

1. Time needs to pass (blocks/time advancement) for interest to accrue on the underlying Compound markets
2. Compound V2 interest rate models need to be active (non-zero borrow/supply rates)

### Attack Path

1. User supplies tokens and receives lToken position tracked in `totalInvestment`
2. Other users borrow tokens, creating interest-generating activity
3. Time passes, causing interest to accrue on the Compound market
4. User calls `CoreRouter.redeem()` to withdraw their position
5. CoreRouter calculates `expectedUnderlying` using stale `exchangeRateStored()`
6. Compound's `redeem()` operation uses current `exchangeRateCurrent()` (higher due to accrued interest)
7. CoreRouter transfers the lower calculated amount to user
8. The difference (user's entitled interest) remains in CoreRouter contract

### Impact

Users suffer systematic fund loss during every redemption operation after interest has accrued. Based on typical DeFi interest rates (5-15% APY), users can lose 1-5% of their entitled redemption amount per year of accrued interest. The lost funds accumulate in the CoreRouter contract, effectively benefiting the protocol at users' expense.
For example, with 1 year of 5% APY interest accrual, a user redeeming 1000 tokens would receive ~975 tokens instead of the entitled ~1025 tokens, losing ~50 tokens (5% of entitled amount).

### PoC

Add this test to test/TestRedeeming.t.sol:
```solidity

function test_exchange_rate_precision_loss() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        uint256 supplyAmount = 1000e18;
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(supplyAmount);

        // Borrower to generate interest
        address borrower = makeAddr("borrower");
        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(borrower, supplyAmount);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), supplyAmount);
        coreRouter.supply(supplyAmount, token);
        coreRouter.borrow(supplyAmount / 2, token); // 50% utilization
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Fast forward to accumulate interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
        vm.roll(block.number + 2102400);

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        uint256 userLTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(
            deployer,
            lToken
        );

        // Record stale vs current exchange rates
        uint256 exchangeRateStale = LTokenInterface(lToken)
            .exchangeRateStored();
        LTokenInterface(lToken).accrueInterest();
        uint256 exchangeRateCurrent = LTokenInterface(lToken)
            .exchangeRateStored();

        // Discrepancy Calculation
        uint256 shouldReceive = (userLTokenBalance * exchangeRateCurrent) /
            1e18;
        uint256 willReceive = (userLTokenBalance * exchangeRateStale) / 1e18;
        uint256 userLoss = shouldReceive - willReceive;

        console2.log("User should receive:", shouldReceive);
        console2.log("CoreRouter calculates:", willReceive);
        console2.log("User loss:", userLoss);
        console2.log(
            "Loss percentage:",
            (userLoss * 10000) / shouldReceive,
            "basis points"
        );

        // Verify
        assertGt(
            exchangeRateCurrent,
            exchangeRateStale,
            "Interest should accrue"
        );
        assertGt(userLoss, 0, "User should lose funds");
        assertGt(
            (userLoss * 10000) / shouldReceive,
            100,
            "Loss should be > 1%"
        );

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```


### Mitigation

Modify CoreRouter to use `exchangeRateCurrent()` instead of `exchangeRateStored()`:

```solidity
// Instead of:
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Use:
uint256 exchangeRateCurrent = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateCurrent();
```
