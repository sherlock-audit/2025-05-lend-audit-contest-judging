# Accrued rewards not reset to zero after claim

### Summary

In the `claimLend()` function of the `CoreRouter` contract, user reward balances (`lendAccrued`) are **not reset to zero after claiming**. This allows malicious actors to repeatedly claim the same accrued LEND rewards, draining the contract’s LEND token balance.

### Root Cause

The function retrieves a user’s `lendAccrued` amount and transfers the LEND tokens using `grantLendInternal`, but fails to reset the accrued amount to zero. Since `lendAccrued[user]` remains unchanged, users can call `claimLend()` multiple times to continuously receive the same rewards.

```solidity
for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
    uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
    if (accrued > 0) {
        grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued); //  @audit-issue  No reset of lendAccrued
    }
    unchecked {
        ++j;
    }
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Lets say Alice accrued 100 LEND tokens as rewards.
2. Alice calls `CoreRouter.claimLend()` function to claim their rewards.
3. Alice receives 100 LEND tokens , but lendAccrued[Alice] is not set to zero.
4. so Alice can call the `CoreRouter.claimLend()` function multiple times until the contract is drained.

### Impact

All LEND tokens held by the `CoreRouter` can be stolen by any user with non-zero accrued rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Introduce a function in the `LendStorage` contract to allow `CoreRouter` contract to update `lendAccrued`:

```solidity
function updateLendAccrued(address user, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorized {
    lendAccrued[user] = amount;
}
```

Then, after successfully granting the rewards in `claimLend`, reset the user's `lendAccrued` to zero:
```solidity
if (accrued > 0) {
    grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
    lendStorage.updateLendAccrued(holders[j], 0);
}
```
