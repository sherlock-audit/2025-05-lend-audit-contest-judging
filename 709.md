# Lack of `safeTransfer` in `borrowForCrossChain` function leading to silent failure goes undetected

### Attack Path

It was observed that the `borrowForCrossChain()` function does not use `safeTransfer` function. Some ERC20 will return a success boolean instead of reverting. Thus, for such tokens, the function will incorrectly assume that the transfer has succeeded, even though it has failed in reality.

The `borrowForCrossChain` is executed during cross-chain borrowing. Thus, the impact is that the victim's collateral will be locked up even though they did not receive the borrowed tokens successfully, leading to a loss of funds for the victims.

```solidity
File: CoreRouter.sol
192:     /**
193:      * @dev Only callable by CrossChainRouter
194:      */
195:     function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
196:         external
197:     {
198:         require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");
199: 
200:         require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
201: 
202:         require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
203: 
204:         IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
205:     }
```

The lack of `safeTransfer` issue is also found in the following function:

```solidity
File: CoreRouter.sol
100:     function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
..SNIP..
123:         // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
124:         IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170

```solidity
File: CoreRouter.sol
145:     function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
..SNIP..
169:         // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
170:         IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```

### Impact

Loss of funds for the victims.
