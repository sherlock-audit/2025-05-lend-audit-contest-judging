# User is required to supply the native asset but the funds are returned to the `CrossChainRouter`

### Summary

As can be seen in the following line of code in the [`CrossChainRouter::_send`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L802C1-L821C6) function, the refund address is specified to be the CrossChainRouter, which means that if the cross chain message fail, the user is essentially robbed of the native currency he provided:
```solidity
     * @notice Sends LayerZero message
     */
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

@>        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }
```

### Root Cause

The refund address being coded to CrossChainRouter

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Cross-chain tx failing and funds being refunded to the CrossChainRouter

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

User being robbed of the native currency he provided

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

change the refund address to `msg.sender` as he is required to provide the assets
