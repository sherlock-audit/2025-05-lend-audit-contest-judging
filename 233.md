# Borrow index changes are applied twice when checking for sufficient collateral backing during same-chain borrows

### Summary

By applying borrow index changes twice to preexisting borrow amounts plus the new borrow, borrows seeking to utilize all available remaining collateral would revert as a second application of the borrow index changes could push total borrows slightly over the collateral - thus reverting a legitimate transaction.

### Root Cause

Users execute same-chain borrows calling [CoreRouter::borrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145-L190), during this call - the collateral ratio of `previous borrows + new borrow` is checked with a call to `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`:

```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        ...

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

        ...
    }
```

Calling `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` applies borrow index changes to the former borrow debt, and adds the the new borrow to the returned `totalBorrows`. By doing this, interest is already accumulated on the previous borrows plus the new one is added - but the following lines reapplies borrow index changes on the entire total borrows:

```solidity
        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
```

Doing this would cause `borrowAmount` to exceed the available `collateral` amount in cases where protocols or end users seek to use up all their collateral on borrowing, or the margin between `totalBorrows (i.e old_borrow_plus_changes + new_borrow)` and `collateral` is small enough to cause reapplying the changed borrow index on `totalBorrows` to be pushed over the `collateral` amount.

This would cause the `require` statement to revert on an otherwise legitimate/allowed transaction:

```solidity
        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User deposits collateral and makes a borrow.
2. After a while user makes another borrow utilizing the remaining collateral while considering and applying borrow index changes on previous borrow.
3. Transaction fails as reapplying the borrow index changes on the already applied total borrows pushes it slightly over the collateral value.

This could also be triggered by protocols who do precise calculations while integrating LEND.

### Impact

User is unable to perform full borrows across the entire collateral range.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the lines:

```solidity
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        ...

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        // @audit-fix: remove the following lines as the borrow index changes have already been applied
        // uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
        //     ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
        //     : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

        ...
    }
```
