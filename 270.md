# Incorrect Addition of lToken of Token User Wants to Borrow on Other Chain to User Supplied Assets

### Summary



Summary
In the borrowCrossChain function, the contract incorrectly adds the lToken of the token the user wants to borrow on the destination chain to the user's supplied assets on the source chain. This misrepresents the user's actual supplied assets and therefore protocol state inconsistencies.

```solidity
        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
```
















### Root Cause

The line:
```solidity    
    lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
```

is called with _lToken being the lToken of the token the user wants to borrow on the other (destination) chain. However, the user is not supplying this token on the source chain, so it should not be tracked as a supplied asset.


### Internal Pre-conditions


The user has not supplied the corresponding lToken as collateral on the source chain.

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

User calls borrowCrossChain to borrow a token on a destination chain.

### Impact

The contract adds the lToken of the token the user wants to borrow on the other chain to the user's supplied assets on the source chain.
The protocol now incorrectly considers the user as having supplied this asset.
State Inconsistency: The user's supplied assets do not accurately reflect their actual supplied tokens, leading to incorrect accounting and potential downstream errors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove these lines 
```solidty
        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)) {
            enterMarkets(_lToken);
        }
```
from the borrowCrossChain function.
