# No way to cancel/refund failed or delayed crosschain borrow request

## Summary
Use can initiate cross chain request from there source chain , However the protocol does not have a way to handle failed or delayed borrow request which can lead to collateral being stuck as a message across chain.
## Description
```solidity
     * @notice Initiates a cross-chain borrow. Initiated on the source chain (Chain A)
     * @param _amount Amount to borrow
     * @param _borrowToken Token to borrow on destination chain
     * @param _destEid Destination chain's layer zero endpoint id
     */
    function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
        require(msg.sender != address(0), "Invalid sender");
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");
        require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");

        // Get source lToken for collateral
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_borrowToken);
        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported source token");

        // Get the destination chain's version of the token
        address destLToken = lendStorage.underlyingToDestlToken(_borrowToken, _destEid);
        require(destLToken != address(0), "Unsupported destination token");

        // Accrue interest on source token (collateral token) on source chain
        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        // Add collateral tracking on source chain
  @>      lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

        if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)) {
            enterMarkets(_lToken);
        }
```
As we can see when the user successfully initiates borrow request the asset is added for the user but if the request fails the asset wont be removed or no way for the user to cancel his delayed or failed borrowed requests
## Impact
Stuck request of the user together with collateral
## Recommended Mitigation
Add mechanism to cancel and refund collateral for failed request
