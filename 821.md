# `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` for deprecated tokens has a flaw

### Summary

In `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` if we are in process of liquidating a deprecated token, the interest accrued to that moment before it was deprecated won't be calculated, just the plain debt, leaving no paid interest, harming the lenders' interests

### Root Cause

Not calculating the interest till the moment the token is deprecated is the root cause

### Internal Pre-conditions

Deprecated token

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice takes $1000 debt with $1050 collateral
2. Token becomes deprecated after 3 months
3. Alice debt actually falls below the minimum collateralization ratio, but her interest that she should have paid or be included in the sum is not there

### Impact

Loss of interest to the lenders as they'll get no interest whenever a token gets deprecated
