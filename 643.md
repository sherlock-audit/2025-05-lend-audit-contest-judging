# Cross-Chain Borrowers Cannot Repay Their Debt

### Summary
In the current cross-chain borrowing process, the borrow request is initiated on chain A (the source chain) where the collateral exists. The user then borrows on chain B (the destination chain), and the transaction is validated on chain A. However, in the final step within the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function, the `crossChainBorrows` is updated without accounting for the interest.

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is that in the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function, the update to `crossChainBorrows` does not consider the interest accrued on the borrowed amount.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L711-L712
```solidity
    function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        // Find the specific borrow record using the new helper
        (bool found, uint256 index) =
            lendStorage.findCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, srcEid, currentEid, payload.destlToken);

        if (found) {
            // Update existing borrow
            LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
711:        userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
712:        userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;

            // Update in storage
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, index, userBorrows[index]);
        } else {
            // Add new borrow record
            lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
                payload.sender,
                payload.srcToken,
                LendStorage.Borrow(
                    srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
                )
            );
        }

        lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(payload.sender, lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(payload.srcToken));

        // Emit BorrowSuccess event
        emit BorrowSuccess(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, payload.amount);
    }
```
As seen in line 711, the principal amount is updated without adjusting for the borrow index. 

However, on chain B, the `crossChainCollaterals` is updated correctly. This discrepancy prevents users from fully repaying their debt, since the deflation of the borrowAmount on chain A.

### Impact
Cross-chain borrowers are unable to repay their debts, resulting in losses for LPs.
Borrowers could repay without any interest and withdraw their collateral.

### Mitigation
Consider correct apply borrow index to `crossChainBorrows`.
