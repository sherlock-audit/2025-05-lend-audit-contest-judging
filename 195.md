Title: Lendtroller::distributeSupplierLend gives wrong LEND rewards when user balance is zero.


Description:

Here's the affected function:

```solidity
function distributeSupplierLend(address lToken, address supplier) internal {
    LendMarketState storage supplyState = lendSupplyState[lToken];
    uint256 supplyIndex = supplyState.index;
    uint256 supplierIndex = lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier];

    lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier] = supplyIndex;

    if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= lendInitialIndex) {
        supplierIndex = lendInitialIndex;
    }

    Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(supplyIndex, supplierIndex)});
    uint256 supplierTokens = LToken(lToken).balanceOf(supplier);
    uint256 supplierDelta = mul_(supplierTokens, deltaIndex);
    uint256 supplierAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[supplier], supplierDelta);
    lendAccrued[supplier] = supplierAccrued;

    emit DistributedSupplierLend(LToken(lToken), supplier, supplierDelta, supplyIndex);
}
```

The problem is on this line:
```solidity
lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier] = supplyIndex;
```

That index update happens no matter what, even if supplierTokens is 0. So if a user had tokens before, leaves the market (redeems all), and comes back later, the protocol acts like they already received all rewards — even though they held nothing when supplyIndex moved forward.

So they end up missing a whole window of rewards.


Impact:

This silently cuts users off from LEND they should have earned. It’s not a steal, but it's inaccurate reward logic. Users who leave and rejoin the market at the wrong time will miss rewards and not even know it.

PoC:

1. User supplies lTokens and earns rewards.


2. They redeem all tokens and balance becomes 0.


3. distributeSupplierLend runs and updates their index anyway.


4. Time passes and LEND is distributed.


5. User comes back and mints lTokens again.


6. Since their index is already at the latest, they get no rewards from past blocks.


7. Rewards are skipped — gone forever.
