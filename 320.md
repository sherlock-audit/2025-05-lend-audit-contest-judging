# Lack of fee could lead to undercollateralized positions overtime or draining of minted tokens

## Summary
When borrowing and redeeming of tokens in the CoreRouter.sol user supply volatile tokens collateral assets capable of depeg, However it fails to charge fee incase of depeg of price or prevent whale user from suppling large supply of tokens to exhaust minting of the Ltokens.
## Description
```solidity
   * @return An enum indicating the error status.
     */
    function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
```
As we can see when redeeming no fee is charged so if price of assets drop the position of user becomes undercollateralized and no way for protocol to back these tokens.
## Impact
- Undercollateralized minting of tokens
- Potential draining of minted tokens
## Recommended Mitigation
Charge a percentage fee to keep minted tokens solvent
