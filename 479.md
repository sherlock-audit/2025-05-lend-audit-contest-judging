# user can borrow tokens even if he didn't have enough collateral due to wrong calculation of total borrowed amount of user



### Summary

when crossChainRouter contract calls repayCrossChainLiquidation function in coreRouter contract during crossChain liquidation process let's see what happens,

```solidity
    function repayCrossChainLiquidation(address _borrower, address _liquidator, uint256 _amount, address _lToken)
        external
    {
        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
        repayBorrowInternal(_borrower, _liquidator, _amount, _lToken, false);
    }
```

```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);


        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();


        uint256 borrowedAmount;


        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }


        require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");


        uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;


        // Transfer tokens from the liquidator to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);


        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);


        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);


        // Repay borrowed tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");


        // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }


        // Emit RepaySuccess event
        emit RepaySuccess(borrower, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);
```
here if we see below lines of code 
```solidity
  if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else{
```
it was removing _lToken from user borrowed assets without checking that weather this borrower has any borrows in same chain borrow manner or not.If this borrow has any same borrows of this token then from now on we not consider them while calculation of total borrowed asset of this borrower. 





### Root Cause

removing _Ltoken from user borrowed assets without checking that weather this borrower has any borrows in same chain borrow manner or not.in below lines of code,
```solidity
  if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else{
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

borrower has same chain borrows of this _lToken

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

user can borrow even if he was undercollaterized due  to wrong calculation of total borrowed amount of user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 don't remove _Ltoken from user borrowed assets without checking that weather this borrower has any borrows in same chain borrow manner or not.in below lines of code,
```solidity
  if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else{
```
