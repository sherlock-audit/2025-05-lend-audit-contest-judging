# Silent transfer failure will not be reverted

### Summary

The missing check if the transfer has succeeded will not catch if there is a silent failure. This can remove users investments without actually redeem their tokens and make loss of fund for them.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter::redeem:`[L124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124) function there is a missing check on transfer function which can silent fail, however the code won't catch that and will continue with it's execution and remove the investments of the user.

Same thing we have also in `CoreRouter::borrow:`[L170](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170C54-L171C1)

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

A token transfer should fail for whatever reason.

### Attack Path

1. User calls redeem
2. Token tries to transfer tokens to the user
3. Something went wrong with the request
4. The protocol is not aware that there is an issue
5. The protocol remove the investments even that they are not received by the user

### Impact

Directly loss for the user. The investments are going to stay in the protocol, but the user cannot redeem them. This is also a reason for other issue related with the investments.

### PoC

Please add the test below to TestRedeeming.t.sol, and run it with following command:

forge test --mt test_transfer_false_silent_failure -vv

**The Test**
```solidity
    function test_transfer_false_silent_failure() public {
        uint256 amount = 10e18;

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

        console.log("totalSupply: ", IERC20(token).totalSupply());
        console.log("LErc20Immutable: ", IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(0x4f559F30f5eB88D635FDe1548C4267DB8FaB0351))); // LErc

        uint256 balanceThatIsMintedAndSupplied = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(0x4f559F30f5eB88D635FDe1548C4267DB8FaB0351));
        uint256 investBefore = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        uint256 exchangeRate = LTokenInterface(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (investBefore * exchangeRate) / 1e18;

        // 3) mock function transfer(...) to return false in order to simulate a silent failure
        vm.mockCall(
            token, abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, deployer, expectedUnderlying), abi.encode(false)
        );

        // 4) Redeem — here the transfer will "return false", but there is no revert
        coreRouter.redeem(investBefore, payable(lToken));

        // 5) checks the balance is not increased, but the investment is zero
        uint256 balanceOfTheDeployerAfterRedeem = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(deployer));
        uint256 investAfter = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        
        console.log("coreRouter: ",  IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(coreRouter)));
        console.log("balanceThatIsMintedAndSupplied: ", balanceThatIsMintedAndSupplied);
        console.log("balanceOfTheDeployerAfterRedeem: ", balanceOfTheDeployerAfterRedeem);
        console.log("investBefore: ", investBefore);
        console.log("investAfter: ", investAfter);

        assertEq(balanceThatIsMintedAndSupplied, IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(coreRouter)), "The coreRouter will hold the tokens, because he redeems them from LErc20Interface, but he wasn't abe to transfer them to the deployer");
        assertEq(balanceOfTheDeployerAfterRedeem, 0, "Deployer NOT have received tokens when transfer returns false");
        assertEq(investAfter, 0, "Investment was cleared even though token.transfer(...) failed silently");

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Either add check to catch if the transfer has failed, either use safeTransfer which will automatically revert

```diff
-        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
+       (bool success, ) = IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
+        if (!success) {
+            revert("Transfer failed");            
+        }
OR
-        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
+       IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

```
