# Users will receive fewer tokens or revert when supplying or redeeming due to missing slippage protection

### Summary

The missing slippage protection in the `CoreRouter.sol`(`supply()` and `redeem()` functions) will cause inconsistent token amounts or revert for users as changes in `exchangeRateStored()` between estimation and actual mint/redeem will result in unexpected token amounts.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol`, the `supply()` and `redeem()` functions use `exchangeRateStored()` before the actual mint or redeem occurs to calculate the expected amounts. However, there is no check comparing the expected output with the actual output after the transaction, causing a mismatch and possible revert or user loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `supply()` with a fixed `_amount` of underlying token.
2. User needs to call `redeem()` with a fixed `_amount` of lTokens.
3. The contract uses `exchangeRateStored()` before mint/redeem to estimate output.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The interest rate model causes `exchangeRateStored()` to change rapidly or non-linearly.
2. A transaction occurs in between `exchangeRateStored()` read and actual mint/redeem, updating the exchange rate.
3. Front-running or race condition likelihood since that's going to be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet as well

### Attack Path

1. User calls `supply()` expecting to mint x lTokens based on `exchangeRateStored()`.
2. Before minting, a large deposit increases `exchangeRateStored()`, reducing actual lTokens minted.
3. User receives fewer lTokens than expected.

OR

1. User calls `redeem()` expecting to receive x underlying based on `exchangeRateStored()`.
2. The actual underlying received is less than expected.
3. The protocol transfers more tokens than it received from the lToken, potentially depleting internal reserves.

### Impact

The user may suffer an approximate loss of value due to incorrect assumptions about token amounts. If unchecked, this can also lead to failed transactions or internal inconsistencies in accounting. In severe cases, protocols may transfer more tokens than were redeemed, causing balance drift or griefing vectors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `minLTokens` parameter to `supply()` and a `minUnderlying` parameter to `redeem()` functions. Compare the actual tokens minted/redeemed with the user-specified minimum and revert if the slippage is unacceptable.

```solidity
require(actualMinted >= minLTokensOut, "Slippage: Too few lTokens minted");
require(actualReceived >= minUnderlyingOut, "Slippage: Too little received");
```
