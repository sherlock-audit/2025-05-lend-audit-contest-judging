### Attack Path

In this protocol design, a critical assumption is made regarding address ownership across multiple EVM-compatible chains. 

When the liquidator wants to liquidate a cross-chain borrowing position in Chain B, it will execute the `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain()` function in Chain B. This will in turn call the `_executeLiquidationCore()`.

```solidity
Chain B's CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain() -> _executeLiquidation() -> _executeLiquidationCore()
```

The system records `msg.sender` as the liquidator’s address, as shown in Line 281 below. Then, it will send a `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` LayerZero (LZ) liquidation message from Chain B to Chain A, so that the liquidation can proceed at Chain A, and the collateral in Chain A will be released to the liquidator if the liquidation is successful.

Within the `_send()` function, the `payload.liquidator` will be set to `msg.sender`. This is an important point to note here.

```solidity
File: CrossChainRouter.sol
264:     function _executeLiquidationCore(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private {
265:         // Calculate seize tokens
266:         address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(params.borrowedAsset);
267: 
268:         (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
269:             .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, params.lTokenToSeize, params.repayAmount);
270: 
271:         require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Seize calculation failed");
272: 
273:         // Send message to Chain A to execute the seize
274:         _send(
275:             params.srcEid,
276:             seizeTokens,
277:             params.storedBorrowIndex,
278:             0,
279:             params.borrower,
280:             lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to Chain A version before sending
281:             msg.sender, // @audit-info This is _liquidator
282:             params.borrowedAsset,
283:             ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
284:         );
285:     }
```

When `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` LZ message is delivered to Chain A's `CrossChainRouter`, the `_handleLiquidationExecute` will be executed, and the collateral will be transferred to the account on the address `payload.liquidator` in Line 337 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L337

```solidity
File: CrossChainRouter.sol
308:     /**
309:      * @notice Handles the final liquidation execution on Chain A (collateral chain)
310:      * @param payload The decoded message payload
311:      */
312:     function _handleLiquidationExecute(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
313:         // Execute the seize of collateral
314:         uint256 protocolSeizeShare = mul_(payload.amount, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));
315: 
316:         require(protocolSeizeShare < payload.amount, "Invalid protocol share");
317: 
318:         uint256 liquidatorShare = payload.amount - protocolSeizeShare;
..SNIP..
335: 
336:         // Update total investment for liquidator
337:         lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
338:             payload.liquidator,
339:             payload.destlToken,
340:             lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
341:         );
```

However, this assumption fails in cases where the liquidation on Chain B is performed by a smart contract wallet rather than an externally owned account. 

The deployment and ownership model for smart contract wallets differs fundamentally from EOAs. While an EOA’s address, derived from its private key, is always the same across all EVM chains, a smart contract wallet’s address is determined by deployment factors such as the deployer address, nonce, and initialization parameters. 

As a result, there is no guarantee that the smart contract wallet address on Chain B exists or is controlled by the same entity on Chain A. It is even possible for a different contract, or no contract at all, to exist at that address on Chain A.

Therefore, if the liquidation is carried out using a smart contract wallet, the liquidator may not be able to claim the seized collateral, as they may not have control over the address in the other chains.

Apart from liquidation, the same thing also occurs for the `borrowCrossChain` where the borrowed token on the destination is always transferred to the `msg.sender` (caller) on the source chain.

### Impact

Loss of assets. Liquidator unable to claim seized collateral.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The solution to this issue is straightforward and commonly used in many protocols. Consider

- Allow the liquidator to define or set the recipient address for the seized collateral on the other chains
- Allow the borrower to define or set the recipient address for receiving the borrowed token in destination chain

Do not use `msg.sender` as the recipient address for other chains, which is a serious design flaw.
