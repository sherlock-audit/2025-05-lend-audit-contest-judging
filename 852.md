# `borrowCrossChain()` has a flawed require statement

### Summary

Let's say user wanna borrow from this function, this [require statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L116) is flawed for one very simple reason, what if the borrower wants to take let's say usdc/usdt/wbtc or a token and not a native token?

Why there's a validation for a native token when the user has a collateral and a borrow token that are both non-native?

This yields broken functionality as it should check if there's an amount of the erc20 token we want to take, not the native token.

### Root Cause

Flawed require statement in `borrowCrossChain()` that checks the native token balance instead of the token we want to actually borrow (and it should check IMO the chain from which we want to borrow and not the chain we are initiating the tx).

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice has supplied $1k dollars worth of tokens and wants to take out $500 of a loan
2. She calls `borrowCrossChain()` to get the borrowed tokens that may be any erc20 she wants to take, but it reverts due to checking the balance of the native token

### Impact

Broken functionality due to a flawed require statement - medium severity

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove that require and potentially add one that checks the borrowed token amount on the chain the user intends to borrow
