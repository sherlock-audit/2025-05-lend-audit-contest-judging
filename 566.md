# Healthy positions will be liquidated due to wrong liquidation check

### Summary

During a cross-chain liquidation, the `_checkLiquidationValid` function performs an incorrect liquidity validation check by artificially inflating the user's borrow amount. Specifically, it mistakenly uses `payload.amount` (which represents an lToken amount) as a new borrow amount in the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` call. This not only introduces a borrow simulation that shouldn't exist at all, but also passes the value in the wrong unit, leading to false liquidations of otherwise healthy positions. 

Additionally, since `payload.amount` is an lToken amount, it is numerically larger than the equivalent underlying token amount due to lTokens typically having a small exchange rate (e.g., 0.2 or 0.5) and more decimals. When this lToken amount is mistakenly treated as an underlying borrow amount, the simulated borrow value becomes heavily inflated. This amplifies the severity of the incorrect borrow simulation, making the user’s position appear significantly riskier than it actually is. Consequently, even a healthy account can be flagged as liquidatable, leading to unjust and exploitable liquidations.

```solidity
    function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );
        return borrowed > collateral;
    }
```

### Root Cause

- The function `_checkLiquidationValid` simulates a new borrow that never actually happens.
- It passes `payload.amount` (which is an lToken amount, i.e., collateral tokens to be seized) as `borrowAmount`, which expects the underlying token amount, not lTokens.
- It shouldn’t simulate any borrow at all in a liquidation validation, the function should only verify whether the current borrow exceeds collateral.
- If a hypothetical change is to be simulated, the amount should have been passed as `redeemTokens`, not `borrowAmount`. But even that is inappropriate in the context of liquidation validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user has $1,000 in cross-chain borrow and $1,400 worth of ETH as collateral on the source chain.
2. The protocol’s liquidation threshold (LLTV) is 75%, and the user’s current LTV is 71.4%, which is safe.
3. A malicious liquidator triggers a cross-chain liquidation of 500 USDC, intending to seize 1,000 cUSDC from the user’s account (0.5 exchangeRate)
4. On the source chain, the function `_checkLiquidationValid` is called and wrongly passes:
   - `payload.destlToken` as `lTokenModify`
   - `payload.amount = 1,000` (lToken amount) as `borrowAmount` (wrong unit and wrong purpose)
5. The function now simulates an additional 1,000 USDC borrow on top of the existing $1,000, increasing the perceived borrow to $2,000.
6. With borrow = $2,000 and collateral = $1,400, the user’s LTV is calculated as 142.8%.
7. The liquidation is allowed to proceed, even though the real LTV was only 71.4%.
8. The user is unfairly liquidated here


### Impact

Users with healthy positions can be liquidated unfairly.

### Mitigation

Do not simulate any borrow or collateral change in `_checkLiquidationValid`.

```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    payload.sender,
    LToken(payable(address(0))), // No modification
    0,
    0
);
```
