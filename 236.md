# Incorrect Refund of Liquidator in Cross-Chain Liquidation Flow

### Summary

In the cross-chain liquidation flow, the protocol refunds the liquidator for a liquidation attempt before any funds are transferred from the liquidator. This creates a critical vulnerability where a malicious actor can repeatedly initiate liquidation attempts on non-liquidatable positions and receive refunds for funds they never spent, effectively draining everything.

### Root Cause

The cross-chain liquidation process refunds the liquidator tokens before any actual token transfer from the liquidator occurs. Specifically, the refund function `_handleLiquidationFailure` executes a token transfer back to the liquidator on Chain B assuming the liquidator has already transferred tokens for liquidation. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L482). However, the protocol only transfers funds from the liquidator later in the flow AFTER the liquidation validity check on Chain A passes.

This mismatch in the timing and ordering of token transfers and refund logic causes the protocol to refund tokens that were never taken, allowing malicious actors to repeatedly attempt liquidations without any upfront cost and receive "free" tokens back.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user calls `liquidateCrossChain()` on Chain B targeting a non-liquidatable borrow.

2. The protocol sends a message to Chain A to check if liquidation is valid.

3. Chain A determines the position is not liquidatable and calls `_sendLiquidationFailure()`, which calls `_handleLiquidationFailure()` on chain B.

4. The liquidator receives a refund on Chain B for tokens never transferred.

### Impact

Malicious user can repeatedly trigger failed liquidations and receive refunds for tokens they never transferred.
