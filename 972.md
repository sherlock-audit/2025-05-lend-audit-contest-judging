# Malicious Borrower will Evade Cross-Chain Debt Accounting

### Summary

In LendStorage.sol the collateral loop in [borrowWithInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497) incorrectly checks that both destEid == currentEid and srcEid == currentEid, which will cause the protocol to ignore any cross-chain borrow on the borrowed chain. 

### Root Cause

In LendStorage.sol:: borrowWithInterest, the code requires:
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) { … }

```

Because srcEid can never equal currentEid for a genuine cross-chain borrow, no cross-chain collateral entry is ever counted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Borrower needs to supply collateral on Chain A and initiate a cross-chain borrow to Chain B, creating one entry in crossChainCollaterals[borrower][underlying] on Chain B with:

srcEid = A
destEid = B
principle = borrowed amount on B
borrowIndex = initial borrow index on B
borrowedlToken = B’s lToken address
srcToken = A’s underlying

Protocol must call borrowWithInterest(borrower, lTokenOnB) when the borrower makes subsequent cross-chain actions on Chain B (e.g., to check “existing borrow”). Because crossChainBorrows[borrower][underlying] is empty on B, execution falls into the else branch that loops over crossChainCollaterals.

Variable currentEid on Chain B must equal B, so each collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid check passes, but collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid always fails (since srcEid == A).

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Collateral Lock on Chain A: Borrower Alice supplies collateral (X tokens of A’s underlying) and calls borrowCrossChain(X, tokenOnB, destEid = B).

Borrow Entry on Chain B: Chain B’s _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest populates crossChainCollaterals[Alice][underlyingA] with a Borrow{ srcEid=A, destEid=B, principle=X, borrowIndex=… }.

Open First Loan on B: B’s borrowWithInterest(Alice, lTokenOnB) is invoked inside getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(…, 0, amount).

Because crossChainBorrows[Alice][underlyingA] is empty on B, the code goes into the else branch looping crossChainCollaterals.

Each collaterals[i] has (srcEid=A, destEid=B). Although destEid == currentEid, the check also requires srcEid == currentEid (i.e. A == B), which fails.

Thus borrowWithInterest returns 0.

Therefore, the protocol thinks Alice has no existing debt on B, so it allows her to borrow up to “collateral value” - 0 (i.e. any positive amount).

Repeat Borrow Rounds: Using the same collateral entry, Alice calls borrowCrossChain again (or repeats borrowForCrossChain) to take out more B-tokens. Each time, borrowWithInterest remains 0 on B, so there is no cap.

Unlimited Under-Collateralized Loans: By looping steps 3–4, Alice can drain B’s liquidity (e.g. stablecoins on B) far beyond her actual collateral, because the protocol never sees that she already owes any amount.
Failed Liquidation Checks: If prices move unfavorably or oracle later flags “Alice is underwater,” any liquidation attempt on B calls borrowWithInterest to confirm shortfall. It still returns 0, so the protocol thinks her debt is zero and refuses to liquidate.

### Impact

 Potentially 100% loss of the borrowed amount on B, because Alice can withdraw unlimited B-tokens while her collateral on A remains locked.

### PoC

Remove the srcEid == currentEid check in the borrowWithInterest function. Simply require:
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid) { … }

```
