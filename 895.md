# System will prevent valid Cross-Chain Liquidations due to Irrelevant Check in `_checkLiquidationValid`

### Summary

A flawed validation logic in `CrossChainRouter._checkLiquidationValid()` on the collateral chain (Chain A) will prevent legitimate cross-chain liquidations initiated from the borrow chain (Chain B). The function performs an irrelevant solvency check, simulating a new borrow of the collateral asset on Chain A, instead of validating the existing undercollateralized debt on Chain B, thus halting valid liquidations and leading to **protocol** bad debt.

### Root Cause

In [CrossChainRouter.sol:431](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431-L436), the `_checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload)` function (called when a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message is received on the collateral chain) uses `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` incorrectly. It passes `payload.amount` (which is `seizeTokens` â€“ the amount of collateral LToken on Chain A to be seized) as the `borrowAmount` parameter to `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. This simulates if the **borrower** were to *additionally borrow* an amount equivalent to the value of `seizeTokens` of the *collateral asset type* on Chain A. This check is not relevant to whether the **borrower** is undercollateralized for their actual debt on Chain B.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A **liquidator** has successfully initiated a cross-chain liquidation on Chain B for a **borrower** who is genuinely undercollateralized.
2. A `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message is sent from Chain B to Chain A.
3. On Chain A, `_lzReceive()` calls `_checkLiquidationValid()`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Liquidator** identifies an undercollateralized cross-chain position for a **borrower** on Chain B.
2. **Liquidator** initiates `liquidateCrossChain()` on Chain B.
3. Chain B `CrossChainRouter` validates this and sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to Chain A (collateral chain).
4. On Chain A, `_lzReceive()` calls `_checkLiquidationValid(payload)`.
5. `_checkLiquidationValid()` calculates `(borrowed, collateral)` by simulating if the **borrower** borrowed an additional `payload.amount` (value of collateral to be seized) of the collateral asset *on Chain A*.
6. If this simulation results in `borrowed <= collateral` (meaning the **borrower** would still be solvent *on Chain A* under this flawed premise, or not sufficiently insolvent), `_checkLiquidationValid()` returns `false`.
7. The liquidation is halted, and `_sendLiquidationFailure()` is invoked.

### Impact

**Protocol** suffers because legitimate cross-chain liquidations are blocked. This allows bad debt to persist and grow, posing a risk of financial loss to the **protocol** or its **users**. This breaks a core safety mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove or fundamentally redesign `_checkLiquidationValid()` on the collateral chain. The primary decision to liquidate should rely on the assessment from the borrow chain (Chain B). If a check on Chain A is kept, it should be relevant, e.g., checking if seizing the collateral makes the **borrower** insolvent for other, separate debts on Chain A.
