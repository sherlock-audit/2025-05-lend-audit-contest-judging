# Liquidation method does not calculate correctly the collateral

### Summary

In liquidateBorrow method, the borrowedLToken is using the [latest borrowIndex](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L236). This is not the case with the collateralToken.

### Root Cause

In liquidateBorrow accrueInterest is invoked only for the borrowedToken, thus increasing the value of the borrowedTokens.
CollateralToken doesnt accrueInterest in this method and thus its outdated value, makes the user vulnerable to incorrect liquidation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. borrowedlToken != lTokenCollateral
2. AccrueInterest is not called on lTokenCollateral for some time

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

User who is not eligible for liquidation could be liquidated

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add this in CoreRouter.sol:237
```solidity
LTokenInterface(lTokenCollateral).accrueInterest();
```
