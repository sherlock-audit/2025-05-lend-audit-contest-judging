# Protocol Reward Accumulation is Unclaimable

### Summary

The `protocolReward` mapping keeps track of how much each lToken has earned for the protocol, but there's no actual function to withdraw or claim those rewards. The updateProtocolReward function just updates the numbers—it doesn’t move any tokens or provide a way to access them. This means the protocol’s rewards are stuck and can’t be used, making the reward system incomplete.








### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L191 we are updating the protocolReward but there is noway to claim them.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Protocol rewards are stuck in the pool, since noway to claim them.

### PoC

This function will only update the reward but will not transfer the reward to the protocol.
```solidity
function updateProtocolReward(address lToken, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorized {
        protocolReward[lToken] = amount;
        emit ProtocolRewardUpdated(lToken, amount);
    }
```
### Mitigation

Implement a function that will allow the user to  claim the protocol rewards.
