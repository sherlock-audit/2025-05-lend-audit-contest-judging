The LEND protocol relies on the LayerZero (LZ) protocol to pass messages between the LEND's routers residing in multiple chains. However, there are a few characteristics of the LZ messaging system that the protocol fails to consider, leading to a wide range of issues. Some characteristics include the following:

- Messages are sent and delivered in an unordered manner, meaning that a message sent later may be delivered before one sent earlier.
- The time it takes to deliver a message may vary; each message can experience a different delivery time.
- Messages sometimes might fail (e.g., due to insufficient gas) on the destination and require a retry, which may affect the delivery time and ordering.

Many issues can arise from the above characteristics, and they are related and should be grouped together as duplicates.

The following is one of the issues that can occur:

- At T0, the value of Bob's collateral in Chain A is worth 10000 USD. He also has a cross-chain borrow in Chain B worth 5000 USDC.
- At T0, Bob decided to perform another cross-chain borrow to borrow an additional 2000 USD worth of assets in Chain B. Thus, a `ContractType.BorrowCrossChain` message will be sent to Chain B
- At T1, when Chain B received the incoming `ContractType.BorrowCrossChain` message from Chain A, it will see that Bob is over collateralized and allow Bob to borrow an additional 2000 USD worth of assets. At the same time, Chain B will send Chain A a `ContractType.ValidBorrowRequest` message so that Chain A will record the newly borrowed amount or new debt.
- At T2, the value of Bob's collateral drops significantly and it is worth 50 USD now. As a result, the liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain()` function against Bob's account in Chain B. Chain B will sent `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to Chain A.
- Note that at this point, there are two (2) messages (`ContractType.ValidBorrowRequest` message & `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message) going towards Chain A.
- At T3, The `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message gets executed in Chain A ahead of the `ContractType.ValidBorrowRequest` message. Thus, Bob's account in Chain A will be cleared and wiped off (all collateral will be liquidated/seized and all debt in the account will be cleared)
- At T4, `ContractType.ValidBorrowRequest` message finally gets executed on Chain A. Thus, this will increase the borrowing amount and the debt of Bob's account. This part is incorrect because Bob's account has already been liquidated earlier. Thus, even if Bob did not initiate any new borrowing after his account was liquidated, his account continues to accrue debt. This incorrect accounting can lead to various issues. For instance, if Bob decided to supply collateral again to borrow some assets, due to the existing debt that is not supposed to be here, his account's debt is inflated. As a result, he might not be able to borrow assets even if he has supplied collateral, leading to a loss for him.
