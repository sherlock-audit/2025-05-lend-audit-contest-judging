# Incorrect Cross-Chain Collateral Verification Leading to Over-Collateralization Requirement

### Summary

The protocol enforces an incorrect collateral check when borrowing across chains by requiring that the collateral on the source chain covers all borrowed amounts on the destination chain, rather than just the new cross-chain borrowing amount. This leads to unnecessarily restrictive borrowing conditions, preventing legitimate transactions.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from the misuse of `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which returns the total borrowed amount (existing + new borrowing) on the destination chain. The protocol then compares this against the source chain collateral, effectively requiring that:

`source_collateral ≥ (existing_borrowing + new_borrowing)`

Instead, the correct logic should ensure:

`source_collateral ≥  source_debt + new_borrowing` because the source chain collateral should backed same chain borrow on source chain and all cross chain borrow where it's the source chain

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has existing borrowings on the destination chain.

2. The user initiates a cross-chain borrowing request (payload.amount).

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Deposit Collateral on Chain A

* Attacker deposits collateral (e.g., 1000 USDC) on Chain A.

2. Borrow Max Amount on Chain A

* Attacker borrows the maximum allowed amount (e.g., 700 USDC) against their collateral on Chain A.

3. Initiate Cross-Chain Borrow on Chain B

* Attacker calls crossChainBorrow to borrow on Chain B.

* The protocol checks if Chain A collateral (1000 USDC) covers the new Chain B loan (e.g., another 700 USDC).

* Since 1000 ≥ 700, the check passes, ignoring the existing 700 USDC debt on Chain A.

4. Result: Double Borrowing

* Attacker now owes 700 USDC on Chain A and 700 USDC on Chain B, using the same 1000 USDC collateral.

* This exceeds the intended collateralization ratio (e.g., 1400 debt against 1000 collateral = 140% utilization).


### Impact

capital inefficiency and loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It will be better to make the solvency check on source chain.
