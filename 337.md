# Incorrect applied interest to `borrowed` return value from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` in `CoreRouter` results in unnecessary DoS and unnecessary liquidations.

**Summary:** 

The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` returns hypothetical `values` of borrowed amounts & supplied amounts. Throughout the `CoreRouter` contract functions, interest is applied on borrowed value before comparing it with supplied value for liquidity shortfall which unnecessarily inflates the value, but also causes DoS. This incorrect implementation has been observed in the following functions,

1. [CoreRouter::borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157)
2. [CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347)

**Description:** 

The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is called by `CoreRouter::borrow` & `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` with the intention to get borrowed amount and collateral amount in order to check for liquidity shortfall before proceeding,

```javascript
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

    uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 
        ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
        : 0;

    require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

```

The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` does not actually return borrowed & collateral amount. It loops through the assets, gets the totalAmount (with interest in case of borrowed assets), multiplies them with prices and it returns their `values`; what they're worth because the function takes into account respective oracle prices,

```javascript
    ...
    ...

    vars.oraclePrice = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissa}); 
    vars.tokensToDenom = mul_(mul_(vars.collateralFactor, vars.exchangeRate), vars.oraclePrice);

    ...

@>  vars.sumCollateral =
        mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.tokensToDenom, lTokenBalanceInternal, vars.sumCollateral);

    ...

@>  vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects =
        mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, totalBorrow, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);

    ...
    ...
    return (vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects, vars.sumCollateral);

```

Before the comparison, the functions in question erroneously apply interest to the returned borrowed value which unnecessarily inflates the value. So, when checking, collateral amount is getting compared against an inflated value.

```javascript

@>      uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 // @audit this isn't right!
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

```

The interest applied here to borrowed value unnecessarily inflates the borrowed value. This will potentially result in DoS when a user tries to borrow tokens. In addition, when a liquidator tries to liquidate someone, it will cause an unfair liquidation since borrowed value could be less than collateral value, but since interest is applied to borrowed value, inflating it, it will cause the following check to succeed,

```javascript
require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

```

This usage of returned values from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` in `borrow` & `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is inconsistent with how it's used in `redeem`. The `redeem` function has the correct implementation,

```javascript

(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

```

In this case, the CoreRouter should be faithful to Compound protocol's implementation of checking for shortfall.

**Impact:** 

Unexpected DoS during borrows and unfair liquidations for users.

**Proof of Concept:**

#### When user tries to borrow (keeping calculations simple)
1. User calls `borrow` to borrow 10 DAI. User has already borrowed 90 DAI. So now the total will be 100 DAI.
2. The collateral is worth $115.
3. The borrowIndex = 1.1e18 (10% interest). The borrowerIndex = 1e18.
4. totalBorrows = 100 DAI * 1.1 / 1 = 110 DAI
5. Oracle price of DAI = $1 â†’ 1e18 (example).
6. sumBorrowPlusEffects = 110 DAI * $1 = $110 (returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`)
7. In `borrow`, the interest is reapplied, this time to the borrow value
   - borrowAmount = ($110 * 1.1e18) / 1e18 = $121 (inflated)
8. The system falsely reverts with "Insufficient collateral" ($115 < $121)
9. In reality, the debt is $110, so the user should be allowed to borrow.

Similar case when liquidator tries to liquidate a user. The borrowedAmount could go above collateral value because of double-application of interest resulting in unnecessary liquidation.


**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Consider using the values returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` directly,

```diff

    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

-   uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 
-       ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
-       : 0;

-   require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
+   require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

```
