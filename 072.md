# Incorrect Redemption Calculation in redeem Function Due to Pre-Redemption Exchange Rate

### Summary

Using an outdated exchangeRateStored before redemption leads to incorrect calculation of underlying tokens for users. This causes the system to transfer the wrong amount of tokens during a redemption, which can result in loss for users or the protocol, as the amount does not match the actual tokens redeemed.

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol:redeem, the contract retrieves the lToken’s exchange rate (exchangeRateStored) before it executes the actual redemption (redeem(_amount)). This is a problem because redeeming tokens changes the total supply and pool balances, which immediately alters the exchange rate. Using the old rate to calculate the underlying tokens results in an incorrect transfer amount.



### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has a sufficient balance of lTokens (lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount).

The user calls redeem with a non-zero _amount.

There is enough collateral to allow redemption (collateral >= borrowed).

### External Pre-conditions

The lToken contract calculates exchangeRateStored based on the current pool balance and total supply of lTokens.

Redemption affects these values (total supply and pool balance), changing the exchange rate.

### Attack Path

The user calls the redeem function with a chosen amount of lTokens.

The contract retrieves exchangeRateStored before redemption, locking in an outdated value.

The user’s _amount is redeemed, reducing the pool’s lToken supply and balance, and updating the actual exchange rate.

The contract calculates expectedUnderlying as _amount * exchangeRateBefore / 1e18, but this value is no longer accurate.

The contract transfers expectedUnderlying tokens to the user, but this amount may not match the real amount that should be transferred based on the updated exchange rate.

### Impact

Users may receive less tokens than they redeemed, causing them to lose part of their funds.

The protocol may accidentally overpay users if the pre-redeem exchange rate was higher than the post-redeem rate, which can lead to a depletion of the pool’s reserves.

Over time, this error breaks the accounting of the system and can damage user trust and protocol stability.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Instead of using a potentially stale exchange rate, measure the actual amount of underlying tokens received by the contract after redemption. This ensures accuracy:

uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualUnderlying = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, actualUnderlying);

This guarantees that the user gets exactly the amount of tokens redeemed, no more, no less.
