# Wrong condition In the borrowWithInterest() will cause the underreporting of borrow amounts

### Summary

The `borrowWithInterest()` function uses an incorrect condition to filter cross-chain collateral borrows, requiring both source and destination chains to be the current chain, which defeats the purpose of cross-chain borrowing and leads to underreported borrow amounts.

### Root Cause

In the [`borrowWithInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497) function, the condition for including cross-chain collateral borrows is incorrectly implemented:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
    // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
    if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
        borrowedAmount +=
            (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
    }
}
```

The condition `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` requires both the source chain (where collateral exists) and destination chain (where borrow occurs) to be the current chain. This is contradictory because:

1. If both source and destination are the same chain, it's not a cross-chain operation
2. According to the function's documentation, `crossChainCollaterals` is populated on the destination chain where the borrow occurs
3. The comment states it should include borrows "if it originated locally", meaning `srcEid == currentEid`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has collateral on Chain A (source chain)
2. User borrows on Chain B (destination chain) 
3. `borrowWithInterest()` is called on either chain to calculate total borrows

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral on Chain A
2. User initiates cross-chain borrow from Chain A to Chain B
3. On Chain A, when `borrowWithInterest()` is called, legitimate cross-chain borrows are excluded from calculation
4. This leads to underreported borrow amounts in liquidity calculations
5. User can potentially borrow more than they should be allowed, or liquidations may be delayed/prevented

### Impact

Cross-chain borrows are systematically excluded from borrow amount calculations, leading to incorrect liquidity assessments. This can result in users being able to over-borrow beyond safe collateralization ratios, potentially causing protocol insolvency. Additionally, legitimate liquidations may not trigger properly due to underreported borrow amounts.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Fix the condition to only check if the collateral originates from the current chain:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
    // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
    if (collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
        borrowedAmount +=
            (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
    }
}
```

This correctly includes cross-chain borrows where the collateral exists on the current chain, regardless of which chain the actual borrowing occurred on.
