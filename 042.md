# Missing collateral factor check in getMaxBorrowAmount allows borrowing up to 100% of collateral value

### Summary

The missing collateral factor check in getMaxBorrowAmount will cause excessive borrowing limits for users as borrowers will be able to borrow nearly 100% of their collateral’s value. This significantly weakens protocol solvency and makes the system vulnerable to undercollateralization and liquidation failures.

### Root Cause

In getMaxBorrowAmount, the root cause is:

In getMaxBorrowAmount, the function calculates maxBorrow = collateral - borrowed without applying a collateral factor (Loan-to-Value ratio). This means it directly uses the raw collateral value as the upper borrowing limit, without accounting for risk buffers or liquidation thresholds.

This choice of logic ignores standard DeFi lending safety practices, where the maximum borrowable amount is a fraction (e.g., 75%) of the collateral's value to prevent insolvency during market fluctuations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User needs to have deposited collateral into the system.

User needs to have an outstanding borrow balance less than their collateral.

getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral returns valid collateral and borrowed amounts (in USD) for the user.



### External Pre-conditions

Collateral asset’s price remains stable or rises (temporarily delaying liquidation).

Market volatility can cause collateral price drops after borrowing.

### Attack Path

User deposits collateral worth $10,000 into the system.

User calls getMaxBorrowAmount and receives a maxBorrow value close to $10,000 (since maxBorrow = collateral - borrowed with no LTV applied).

User borrows this maximum amount.

If the collateral’s value drops even slightly (e.g., by 5%), the system has insufficient protection because the user borrowed almost the entire collateral value.

The user’s position becomes undercollateralized. If liquidation mechanisms don’t react instantly, the system incurs bad debt and solvency risk.



### Impact

The protocol suffers a full insolvency risk from the borrower’s position if the collateral value drops. Borrowers can borrow up to 100% of their collateral’s USD value, creating high systemic risk and potential for protocol-wide bad debt. This also exposes the system to economic attacks where malicious users intentionally borrow excessively before orchestrating price drops.

### Mitigation

Introduce a collateral factor (LTV):
Add logic to retrieve the collateral factor for _lToken, e.g.:

uint256 collateralFactor = getCollateralFactor(_lToken); // E.g. 75% (0.75 * 1e18)
uint256 maxBorrow = (collateral * collateralFactor / 1e18) - borrowed;


Consider liquidation thresholds:
Incorporate logic to apply a buffer between the max borrow and liquidation levels.
