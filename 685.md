# Refunding Non‐Escrowed Liquidator Funds on Cross‐Chain Liquidation Failure

### Title
Refunding Non‐Escrowed Liquidator Funds on Cross‐Chain Liquidation Failure

### Severity
Medium

### Impact
When a cross‐chain liquidation fails, the contract attempts to return `payload.amount` of the borrowed asset to the liquidator (“refund”). However, those tokens were never pulled into escrow at the start of `liquidateCrossChain`, so no actual balance exists to return. As a result:
	•	The safeTransfer in `_handleLiquidationFailure` may revert for insufficient balance, causing the failure‐handler itself to fail.
	•	Even if it did not revert (e.g., if the contract happened to hold that token), the liquidator would receive tokens they never spent—upending correct accounting.
Overall, liquidators cannot recover their funds when a liquidation fails, and the protocol’s token balances become inconsistent.

### Likelihood
High
•	Any unsuccessful cross‐chain liquidation (e.g., payload failing _checkLiquidationValid) will invoke this refund logic.
•	Because no initial pull is made, every liquidation failure triggers this defect.


### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol

## Description
In `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain`, the contract never pulls the repayAmount from the liquidator’s wallet into escrow before dispatching the LayerZero message. Downstream, `_executeLiquidationCore` calls `_send(...)` with `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute`. If `_checkLiquidationValid(payload)` returns false on Chain A, the router sends a `LiquidationFailure` message back to Chain B, which eventually invokes `_handleLiquidationFailure`. That function executes:
```solidity
IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);
```
It assumes the router already holds payload.amount of the underlying borrowed asset in its own balance. But because the contract never transferred those tokens from the liquidator at the start, its balance for that token is zero (or arbitrary), so the refund either:
1.	Reverts due to insufficient balance, leaving the liquidator’s original funds unrecovered and trapping the failure‐handler in revert; or
2.	Sends arbitrary tokens if some leftover balance exists, effectively giving the liquidator “free” tokens.

In both cases, the refund logic is broken because the contract never “escrowed” the liquidator’s tokens initially.


## Exploit Scenario
1.	Bob attempts a cross‐chain liquidation on Chain B by calling `liquidateCrossChain(...)` without transferring any tokens.
2.	On Chain A, `_checkLiquidationValid` returns false (liquidation is invalid).
3.	A `LiquidationFailure` message is sent back to Chain B.
4.	In `_handleLiquidationFailure`, the contract attempts to safeTransfer `payload.amount` DAI back to Bob. But the router’s balance of DAI is zero.
5.	The safeTransfer reverts with “ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance,” bubbling up and causing the entire `_handleLiquidationFailure` call to revert. No refund occurs, and Bob loses nothing to begin with—but the contract’s state machine remains stuck or inconsistent.

Alternatively, if the router held some DAI from other operations:
4a. `_handleLiquidationFailure` succeeds, sending that preexisting DAI to Bob—even though Bob never paid anything. He “earns” tokens for a failed liquidation, and the contract’s reserves are drained.

## Recommendations
Escrow Liquidator Funds Upfront
Before sending the cross‐chain liquidation message, pull the repay‐amount out of the liquidator’s balance into the router:
```solidity
IERC20(borrowedAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), repayAmount);
```
