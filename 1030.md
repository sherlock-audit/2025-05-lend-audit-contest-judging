# Lack of Freshness/Slippage Checks

### Summary

Whenever getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral or getMaxWithdrawable fetch a price via UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(...), there is no validation of timestamp, deviation limits, or fallback to a secondary feed.

### Root Cause

In LendStorage.sol. 
The functions https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L600
have no require(block.timestamp - priceTimestamp < SOME_THRESHOLD) or require(priceMantissa < previousPrice × 2) or any kind of check against stale data or extreme outliers. It simply trusts that the oracle returns “the right price” for whatever block you’re in.
The fact that this oracle is an “Uniswap‐anchored” view does not guarantee perfect safety. Even if it uses a TWAP on Uniswap, many implementations still allow a single‐block manipulation if the pool is shallow or if the anchor period is very short. 



### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

Price Oracle manipulation.

### Attack Path

Suppose Alice legitimately deposited 100 X as collateral and borrowed $50 USDC. Everything is healthy at Token X = $1.00. Her position is:

Collateral: 100 X × $1.00 = $100
Debt: $50 USDC

She has $50 of unused “collateral headroom.”

An attacker wants to drain Alice’s 100 X collateral by making it look to the protocol like her collateral just halved in value. They:

Flash‐loan $80 WETH and dump it into the Uniswap X/WETH pool, driving X’s on‐chain spot price down to $0.50.

In that same block, call CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow(Alice, ... ). Now:

The protocol’s getAccountLiquidityInternal(Alice) computes:
– Collateral = 100 X × $0.50 = $50
– Borrowed = $50 (her existing loan)
– Shortfall = Borrowed – Collateral = $0.
– Some implementations treat “shortfall = 0” as “just barely liquidatable.” If not, the attacker can push the price a bit lower, to $0.49, so shortfall = $0.51.

The requirement require(shortfall > 0, "Insufficient shortfall"); now passes—protocol thinks Alice is underwater.

The attacker calls liquidateBorrow(Alice, \$50, X) and seizes, say, 50 X from her, paying only $50 USDC.

Reverse the price manipulation. The Uniswap price for X goes back to $1.00 when the pool rebalances the flash loan. Now the attacker holds 50 X worth $50, for an out‐of‐pocket cost of $50 USDC—i.e. they got $50 of real collateral for “free” (because Alice’s position was never underwater at $1.00).

In each scenario, the oracle feeding into getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral or „getMaxWithdrawable” produced an artificially high or low price for just long enough (one block) to let the attacker either over‐borrow or to liquidate someone who was in reality healthy.



### Impact

Price is the foundation of everything: Collateral valuations, LTV checks, and liquidation thresholds all use that single call to getUnderlyingPrice(...). If the price can be “spiked” or “dumped” for one block, the entire solvency model collapses.

Flash loans make manipulation trivial: An attacker doesn’t need $10 million of capital. They can borrow from Aave or other protocols, move the price by 50% (or more) in a thinly‐traded pool, and then revert the price in the same transaction—paying only standard flash‐loan fees.

Under‐ and over‐collateralization:

Over‐borrowAttack: Walk away with tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars of extra tokens, with no real collateral backing.

UnjustLiquidationAttack: Liquidate perfectly healthy users at a steep discount. The attacker basically snatches collateral at a fire‐sale price.

Bad debt and irrecoverable losses: Once the block ends, the attacker’s debt is underwater but they no longer need to repay—often they simply default, leaving the protocol hanging on bad debt. Users who got liquidated lose their collateral permanently.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Strengthen Oracle Validation

Before using getUnderlyingPrice(...), check that the returned price timestamp is “fresh” (e.g. within the last 15 minutes). If stale, revert.

Add acceptable deviation checks (e.g. require price ∈ [0.8×TWAP_1h, 1.2×TWAP_1h]). Or integrate a second fallback oracle.
