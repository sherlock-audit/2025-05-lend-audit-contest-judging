# No Way to Supply ETH to CoreRouter Contract

### Summary

One of the tokens in scope is Native ETH, but there is no way for suppliers to supply native ETH to the CoreRouter contract.


### Root Cause

The `supply` function is not payable and it calls the `LErc20.mint(uint256)` function which only works with ERC20 tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The user wants to supply ETH


### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The code is not compatible with in-scope Native ETH.


### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Either make the current `supply` function payable and handle the case for ETH, or add a separate function to handle Native ETH tokens.
