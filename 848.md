# Incorrect calculation in `getMaxWithdrawable()`

### Summary

The `getMaxWithdrawable()` function currently returns `min(marketLiquidity, maxWithdrawUnderlying)`, but it should instead return `min(marketLiquidity, maxWithdrawUnderlying, getTotalSupplied())` for the specific lToken.

### Root Cause

The `getMaxWithdrawable()` function relies on `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` to determine the net redeemable amount of a `lToken`. However, this calculation is based on `totalBorrows` and `totalCollateral` of the user across the chain and not on the actual investment in the specific `lToken` by the user. As a result, the computed redeemable amount may exceed the actual totalInvestment by the user in that particular lToken.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

This discrepancy can allow users to attempt withdrawals exceeding the actual investment in a specific lToken, potentially leading to failed transactions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `getMaxWithdrawable()` logic to include a check by using `min(marketLiquidity, maxWithdrawUnderlying, getTotalSupplied())`. This ensures the `maxwithdrawable` amount never exceeds the total supply of the `lToken` by the user.
