# User will receive less interest than he should when redeeming his collateral

### Summary

Caching the [exchange rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L115) and then using it to calculate how much underlying tokens to send, results in discrepancy between actual tokens sent to the router contract and what is sent to the user.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L115) the used exchange rate is outdated, because in the `lToken.redeem` function, exchange rate is modified in the `accrueInterest` function (Compound V2 core method).

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Users suffers from lost profits, which are more and more with each blocking passing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either move `uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();` after redeem, or track how many underlying tokens does the `CoreRouter` contract have before and after redeem.
