# User will bypass borrow limits due to ignoring cross-chain debt

### Summary

An incorrect assumption in `borrow()` causes users’ borrow limits to be calculated only from same-chain borrow state. If a user holds **only cross-chain debt** and no local-chain borrow, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` will be `0`, leading to a miscalculated `borrowAmount = 0`, allowing the user to **bypass collateral checks** and **borrow more than allowed**.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol: 157 borrow()` function, the following logic is used:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-sylvarithos/blob/551944cd87d138620b89c11674a92f1dcbe0efbe/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    ...
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

157    uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
        ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
        : 0;

    require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

```

- If the user has **no local-chain borrow**, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0`
- Therefore, `borrowAmount` becomes 0
- But the variable `borrowed` already includes all borrow debt (same-chain + cross-chain), calculated by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`

This results in a logical inconsistency where a **non-zero borrow liability** is compared against **zero** in the `require(collateral >= borrowAmount)` check.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user borrows cross-chain (i.e., supplies collateral on Chain A, borrows on Chain B)
2. The user has no local borrow balance on Chain A
3. User initiates `borrow()` on Chain A

### External Pre-conditions

- None required

### Attack Path

1. Attacker supplies collateral on Chain A
2. Borrows on Chain B — creating a cross-chain borrow record only
3. Calls `borrow()` again on Chain A
4. `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0` → `borrowAmount = 0`
5. Liquidity check uses real collateral vs fake borrow = 0
6. User passes check and borrows again
7. Protocol ends up undercollateralized

###  Impact

- The user can bypass liquidity constraints
- Over-borrowing becomes possible
- Protocol ends up undercollateralized
- May result in insolvency or inability to liquidate

### 🛡️ Mitigation

Use `borrowed` directly for comparison, as it already includes full debt:

```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    ...
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

-    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

-    uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
        ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
        : 0;

-    require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
+    require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
