# Incorrect LEND Reward Calculation Across Chains

### Summary

The distributeBorrowerLend function calculates a user's LEND rewards using the borrowWithInterest helper, which includes borrow amounts from other chains. However, the LEND index (lendBorrowState) in Controller is calculated and updated only for the current chain. This mismatch leads to incorrect reward calculations, allowing users with cross-chain borrows to claim more rewards than they are entitled to, draining the reward pool and causing losses to other users.



### Root Cause

The reward distribution logic uses a borrow amount (borrowWithInterest) that sums up the user’s borrowed amounts across multiple chains, whereas the reward index (lendBorrowState) is updated only with borrow activity local to the current chain. This results in an inconsistency where a globally calculated borrow amount is multiplied by a locally updated reward index, leading to reward inflation.

```solidity
function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external onlyAuthorized {
        // Trigger borrow index update
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerBorrowIndexUpdate(lToken);

        // Get the appropriate lend state based on whether it's for supply or borrow
        (uint224 borrowIndex,) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).lendBorrowState(lToken);

       ...

        // Calculate change in the cumulative sum of the LEND per borrowed unit accrued
        Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(borrowIndex, borrowerIndex)});

        // Calculate the appropriate account balance and delta based on supply or borrow
        uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
            add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
            Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
        );

}

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has an open borrow position on a different chain
The user's total borrow includes borrowWithInterest that cross-chain borrow amount
The reward index (lendBorrowState) is only updated on the current chain using local supply and borrow data.

### Attack Path

1. Setup:

User Alice supplies collateral on Chain B, but borrows tokens on Chain A (not Chain B).
Controller on Chain B calculates total protocol borrow as 1,000 tokens and sends 1,000 LEND rewards to CoreRouter on Chain B for distribution.

2. Borrow Activity:

Alice’s borrow is only on Chain A. The Controller on Chain B does not see this borrow when calculating rewards.

3. Claiming Rewards:

 Alice calls claimLend on Chain B.
distributeBorrowerLend on Chain B uses borrowWithInterest, which  includes Alice’s borrow from Chain A.
Alice is credited with LEND rewards 

4. Overclaim:

Suppose Alice’s cross-chain borrow is large enough that, according to the protocol’s logic, she should receive 100 LEND tokens.
She claims these 100 LEND tokens from the 1,000 LEND sent by the Controller.

5. Impact on Other Users:

The Controller only intended to distribute LEND based on actual borrows on Chain B.
Honest users who only borrow on Chain B may find that their share of LEND rewards is reduced or depleted (e.g., Bob tries to claim his 100 LEND, but there’s not enough left).


### Impact

Users can overclaim LEND rewards without matching borrow activity on the current chain.
Other users are underpaid or completely deprived of their rightful LEND rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the distribute logic to calculate rewards on local chains only as the controller uses total borrow amounts to calculate total rewards
