# Liquidators will receive incorrect collateral values affecting protocol solvency

### Summary

Missing collateral factor consideration in liquidation calculations will cause unfair liquidations for the protocol as liquidators will receive improperly calculated collateral amounts during seize operations.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol` the liquidation process calculates seize amounts without accounting for collateral factor differences between assets. The direct calculation of `seizeTokens` based only on repayment amount ignores the risk-adjusted value of collateral assets as defined by their collateral factors in the Lendtroller.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have assets with different collateral factors (e.g., ETH at 75% and USDC at 85%)
2. A borrow position must become undercollateralized on one chain while having collateral on another chain
3. Liquidator must initiate cross-chain liquidation via `liquidateCrossChain()`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price volatility must create an undercollateralized position worth liquidating
2. Gas prices must be low enough to make cross-chain liquidation economically viable

### Attack Path

1. Borrower deposits low collateral-factor asset (e.g., ETH at 75%) as collateral on Chain A
2. Borrower borrows high-value asset (e.g., USDC) on Chain B
3. Prices shift making position undercollateralized
4. Liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain()` to seize ETH collateral
5. System calculates seize amount based purely on USDC debt without adjusting for ETH's 75% collateral factor
6. Liquidator receives disproportionately large ETH amount compared to risk-adjusted value

### Impact

The protocol suffers economic losses from improperly balanced liquidations. When liquidators receive more collateral than the risk-adjusted value of the debt:
- Protocol reserves are depleted faster than designed
- Bad debt accumulates in the system
- Future liquidators may avoid unprofitable positions
- Ultimately reduces protocol solvency and user confidence

### PoC

1. Protocol setup:
   - ETH collateral factor: 75% (worth $1500)
   - USDC collateral factor: 85%
2. Alice deposits 1 ETH ($1500) on Chain A
3. Alice borrows $1125 USDC on Chain B (75% of ETH value)
4. ETH price drops to $1400 (position becomes undercollateralized)
5. Bob liquidates:
   - Debt: $1125 USDC
   - Current system seizes: $1125 worth of ETH (0.803 ETH)
   - Proper collateral-adjusted seize: $1125/0.75 = $1500 worth (1.071 ETH)
6. Bob profits by getting 0.803 ETH instead of proper 1.071 ETH
7. Protocol loses 0.268 ETH per liquidation

### Mitigation

Use the Lendtroller's built-in liquidation calculator that properly accounts for collateral factors:

```solidity
// CrossChainRouter.sol
function _executeLiquidationCore(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private {
    // Replace manual calculation with:
    (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
        .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(
            params.borrowedlToken,
            params.lTokenToSeize,
            params.repayAmount
        );
    require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Seize calculation failed");
    
    // Rest of function remains same
    _send(...);
}
```
This ensures liquidations respect each asset's risk parameters as defined in the Lendtroller, maintaining protocol solvency and fair liquidation incentives.
