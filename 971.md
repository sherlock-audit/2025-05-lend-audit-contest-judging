# CoreRouter must use a lower LTV than Compound to prevent liquidations and accounting failure


### Summary

The protocol architecture involves a CoreRouter that intermediates user interactions with a Compound-like fork. Users supply and borrow through the CoreRouter, which then performs these actions on the underlying Compound fork on their behalf.

However, both the CoreRouter and the Compound fork currently use the same Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This opens up a critical vulnerability: if the CoreRouter itself becomes undercollateralized, it may be liquidated by the Compound fork. The CoreRouter is not designed to handle being liquidated, and if this happens, it can irreparably corrupt internal accounting, leading to loss of user funds or protocol-wide failures.

### Root Cause

- The protocol uses the same LTV value in both the Compound fork and the CoreRouter.
- The CoreRouter aggregates the collateral and borrow positions of multiple users, but its internal state does not support handling external liquidation against it.
- If the total borrow exceeds the effective collateral after applying LTV, the CoreRouter becomes liquidatable, and liquidation of its positions will break the internal accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

CoreRouter needs to become liquidatable

### External Pre-conditions
None

### Example Attack / Failure Scenario

Assume there are only two users:

- Alice: $1,000 ETH collateral, $760 borrow  
- Bob: $1,000 BNB collateral, $850 borrow  
- LTV = 80%

On an individual level:
- Alice’s liquidity = $1,000 * 0.8 - $760 = $40 (safe)
- Bob’s shortfall = $1,000 * 0.8 - $850 = -$50 (liquidatable)

On CoreRouter aggregate level:
- Total borrow = $1,610  
- Effective collateral = $2,000 * 0.8 = $1,600  
- CoreRouter is in shortfall of $10

A liquidator could now liquidate the CoreRouter’s position directly via the Compound fork:
- The liquidator may seize Bob’s lBNB tokens from the CoreRouter.
- But the CoreRouter doesn’t track external lBNB balances, and cannot account for the loss.

As a result:
- Bob cannot redeem his lBNB tokens.
- Alice cannot repay her borrow as it’s already repaid via liquidation.
- The system enters an unrecoverable state.

### Impact

- Users will lose access to their collateral or be unable to repay.
- Internal accounting of CoreRouter will break.


### Recommendation

Use a lower LTV for CoreRouter than the Compound fork. This ensures:
- User positions are liquidated earlier (inside the router) before the CoreRouter becomes liquidatable.
- CoreRouter always stays overcollateralized relative to its obligations.


This is critical for systems where a single actor (CoreRouter) proxies many user positions and is not designed to handle being liquidated externally.
