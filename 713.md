# Interest will not be correctly accrued on cross-chain borrows

### Summary

Interest will not be correctly accrued on cross-chain borrows

### Root Cause

When a user tries to repay his "cross-chain borrows", as a final step the [`CoreRouter::repayBorrowInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459-L475) is invoked where is also responsible to accrue new interest on the debt. However if the look at the `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest`:

```javascript
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
@>>>                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
```

We can see that it requires the dest. endpoint it and source endpoint id must be the same in order to apply the interest. But this is incorrect, since this is cross-chain borrowing. Hence borrower will not get interest accrued, which causes losses to the protocol

### Internal Pre-conditions

Borrower must have `cross-chain debt`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Cross-chain borrowers will not get interest applied on their debt

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
-                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
+                if (collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
```
