### Attack Path

In Line 320 below, if it is the user's first supply, it will set the `supplierIndex` to 1.0 (LEND_INITIAL_INDEX = 1e36). However, this is incorrect. The `supplierIndex` should be set to the current supply index instead.

The `supplierIndex` variable is used in Line 324 below to compute the `deltaIndex`, which is the amount of rewards earned since the last update. In this case, during the first supply, the user will earn rewards for periods before they actually supplied.

### Impact

Users can steal reward tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply the following fix:

```diff
// Update the account's index to the current index since we are distributing accrued LEND
if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
    // Covers the case where users borrowed tokens before the market's borrow state index was set.
    // Rewards the user with LEND accrued from the start of when borrower rewards were first
    // set for the market.
-    supplierIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX;
+    supplierIndex = supplyIndex;
}
```
