# interest was not considered while liquidation when market is deprecated

### Summary

when liquidators want to liquidate a user they call coreRouter::liquidateBorrow function which internally calls liquidateBorrowInternal function which calls liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function which checks that borrower is eligible to liquidate or not.
when market is deprecated then 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L340-L341
```solidity
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
```
as we see above it was check that weather borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount or not. But here we should also consider interest accured. for that we should do check like this 
```solidity
   require(borrowBalance.amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex >= 
repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
```
which will also consider interest accured.

### Root Cause

using this 
```solidity
   require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
``` 
instead of 
```solidity
 require(borrowBalance.amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex >= 
repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
```
### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

market of this borrowed token is deprecated.

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

liquidation call will fail if liquidator wants to liquidate entire borrow position when market is deprecated

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use this 
```solidity
 require(borrowBalance.amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex >= 
repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
```

instead of this
```solidity
   require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
```
