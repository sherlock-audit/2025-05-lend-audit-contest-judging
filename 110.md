# Ambiguous Position Matching in `CrossChainRouter::_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function.

### Summary

`CrossChainRouter::_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function validates And prepare for specific borrowed asset crosschain. The function may select a position with incorrect collateral (e.g., DAI instead of lWETH) for liquidation, despite specifying `lTokenToSeize`.


### Root Cause

The `Lend` protocol allows any user to supply in one chain and borrow on another chain. And there is specific allowed asset or token for which the user can borrow and supply. Suppose user had supplied multiple collateral (eg. `DAI`, `WETH` etc). the protocol allows user to supply multiple asset into the pool. Now suppose user has borrowed some asset like `USDC` in different chain with these multiple supplied collateral. Then each borrow will mapped into `LendStorage::Borrow` structure with their appropriate data like `srcEid`, `borrowedlToken` etc.

Now if there is a condition happened where use is undercollaterize for specific supplied collateral. Then if the `liquidateCrossChain` function called  by keeper or any user. Then it will first validate for the borroed asset. but the main bug is there.

```solidity
        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCrossChainCollaterals =
            lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(params.borrower, borrowedUnderlying);
        bool found = false;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCrossChainCollaterals.length;) {
@>          if (userCrossChainCollaterals[i].srcEid == params.srcEid) {
                found = true;
@>              params.storedBorrowIndex = userCrossChainCollaterals[i].borrowIndex;
@>              params.borrowPrinciple = userCrossChainCollaterals[i].principle;
                break;
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

now if you know the `liquidateCrossChain` function sets the value `0` for `storedBorrowIndex` and `borrowPrinciple`. Now suppose this loop iterate and matches the borrowed then these two values are set according to the value stored in the `userCrossChainCollaterals` structure. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L216-L217

```solidity
@>              params.storedBorrowIndex = userCrossChainCollaterals[i].borrowIndex;
@>              params.borrowPrinciple = userCrossChainCollaterals[i].principle;
```

now there is possibality to Ambiguous values in the `userCrossChainCollaterals` array beacuse the user has supplied with multiple token or asset to the same chain and borrowed with diffrent chains. Then it can be possible for this loop to match different borrowed for liquidation instead of the intended borrow. because it only matches by `srcEid` but `lTokenToSeize` value is not checked, and for the first match the loop will `break`. This will set different value for `storedBorrowIndex` and `borrowPrinciple` according to different match and different collateral. in the loop and further liquidation process will continue.

### Impact

- Undervalued collateral seizure
- Unfair collateral loss, eroding trust and TVL.
- Mismatched collateral-debt mapping, leading to under-collateralized positions 
- liquidation with different index and principle.

### PoC

Suppose there is a liquidation scenario.

- Collateral (Chain A, srcEid = 1): 1 ETH ($600, as lWETH), 5,000 DAI ($500).
- Debt (Chain B): 300 USDC (lWETH collateral), 100 USDC (DAI collateral), 200 WBTC (lWETH collateral).

if luquidation has been triggered: `srcEid = 1, lTokenToSeize = lWETH, borrowedAsset = USDC.` wiht appropriate arguments.

- Loop matches Position 3 (100 USDC, DAI collateral, srcEid = 1) if this value is before then intended borrow value in `userCrossChainCollaterals` array.
- Values are set for `storedBorrowIndex` and `borrowPrinciple` according to different asset or borrow.

which results in wrong calculations and the liquidation will happens in wrong way.

### Mitigation

Loop should check for `lTokenToSeize` as well also along side the `srcEid`.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCrossChainCollaterals.length;) {
    if (userCrossChainCollaterals[i].srcEid == params.srcEid &&
        userCrossChainCollaterals[i].borrowedlToken == params.lTokenToSeize) {
        found = true;
        params.storedBorrowIndex = userCrossChainCollaterals[i].borrowIndex;
        params.borrowPrinciple = userCrossChainCollaterals[i].principal;
        break;
    }
    unchecked { ++i; }
}
