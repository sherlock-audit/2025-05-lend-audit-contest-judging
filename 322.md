# Lack of slippage when supplying and redeeming

## Summary
When user supply or redeem tokens to calculate the amount received the protocol checks the exchangeRate of the token which could be gotten from Oracle, However no deviation or slippage can be specified from the user to prevent Frontrunning or Mev attacks allowing him to receive less than the asset provided.

## Root cause
```solidity
    // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
```
The is issue is gotten from the exchangeRate for minting without validation
## Description
```solidity
* @dev Allows users to supply tokens to mint lTokens in the Compound protocol.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to supply.
     * @param _token The address of the token to be supplied.
     */
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");

        // Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);

        // Get exchange rate before mint
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
```
When suppling and redeeming of tokens the user could be exploited by an attacker to skew the exchange price of the tokens or the Attacker can sandwich a user deposits.

## Impact
- User would receive way less tokens than the asset supplied
- Sandwiching of user deposits
## Recommended Mitigation
Add a slippage protection
