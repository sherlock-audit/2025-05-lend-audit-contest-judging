# Incorrect maxClose Calculation in Liquidation

## Summary:
The contract incorrectly calculates the maximum amount a liquidator can repay during liquidation, using the original borrowed principal instead of the current total debt (principal + accrued interest). This limits the liquidator's ability to fully close underwater positions.

## Vulnerability Detail:
In the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, the `maxClose` variable, which determines the maximum amount a liquidator can repay, is calculated using `borrowBalance.amount`. This value represents the borrower's principal at the time of the last borrow or repayment, not their current total debt including accrued interest. When interest accrues, the borrower's actual debt (`borrowedAmount`) becomes greater than `borrowBalance.amount`. Consequently, the calculated `maxClose` is lower than the intended maximum based on the current debt, preventing liquidators from repaying the full allowed percentage of the outstanding loan.

## Impact:
This vulnerability can lead to the accumulation of bad debt within the protocol. Liquidators may be unable to fully liquidate underwater positions because the contract restricts the amount they can repay based on an outdated principal value. The remaining debt, if unrecoverable, becomes a loss for the protocol.

## Recommendation:
Modify the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function to calculate `maxClose` using the borrower's current total borrowed amount (`borrowedAmount`) instead of the original principal (`borrowBalance.amount`).
