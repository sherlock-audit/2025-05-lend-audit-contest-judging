# Incorrect exchange rate calculation for tokens with different decimals causes economic imbalance

## Description:
The `supply()` and `redeem()` functions in CoreRouter.sol incorrectly handle exchange rate calculations for tokens with varying decimal places. The protocol documentation states it will support "whitelisted only (e.g BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT). ERC20 standard" tokens, which have different decimal configurations (USDC/USDT: 6 decimals, DAI: 18 decimals, etc.). While the Compound-based `exchangeRateStored()` function returns values scaled by 1e18 regardless of underlying token decimals, the protocol's calculations fail to account for these decimal differences.

```solidity
function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ... other code ...
    
    // Get exchange rate before mint (always scaled by 1e18)
    uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

    // Mint lTokens
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

    // VULNERABILITY: Assumes all tokens have 18 decimals
    uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
    
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118
```solidity
function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
    // ... other code ...
    
    // Get exchange rate before redeem (always scaled by 1e18)
    uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

    // VULNERABILITY: Assumes 1e18 scaling for all tokens regardless of their decimals
    uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

    // Perform redeem
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

    // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
    
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```

The issue is that both functions use hardcoded 1e18 scaling in their calculations, but this is only correct for tokens with 18 decimals. For tokens with different decimal places, this leads to massive calculation errors.

## Attack path:
1. Attacker supplies 6-decimal tokens (e.g., 1,000,000 USDC = 1,000,000 10^6 = 1e12 units)
2. The `supply()` function calculates mintTokens = (1e12 * 1e18) / exchangeRate
3. This treats the 6-decimal amount as if it were 18-decimal, resulting in 10^12 times more lTokens than intended
4. Attacker's `totalInvestment` is updated with this inflated amount
5. Attacker can then redeem these inflated lToken balances
6. The `redeem()` function calculates `expectedUnderlying` using the same flawed logic
7. Attacker receives massive amounts of underlying tokens, draining protocol reserves
8. Alternatively, attacker can use inflated lToken balances as collateral for borrowing

## Impact:
Complete economic breakdown of the protocol
Users supplying 6-decimal tokens (USDC, USDT) receive 10^12 times more lTokens than intended
Users can drain protocol reserves through supply/redeem cycles with non-18 decimal tokens

## Recommended Mitigation:
Implement proper decimal scaling that accounts for the underlying token's actual decimal places
