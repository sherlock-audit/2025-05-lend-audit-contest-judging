# CrossChainRouter will overestimate borrowing capacity for borrowers as it sends unadjusted collateral to destination chain

### Summary

The use of raw collateral value from getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() in borrowCrossChain() will cause overestimation of borrowable liquidity for borrowers as CrossChainRouter will pass total collateral to the destination chain without accounting for existing same-chain borrows.

### Root Cause

In [CrossChainRouter.sol:138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L154), the borrowCrossChain() function uses the collateral value returned by getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() without subtracting the borrow value (sumBorrowPlusEffects). This results in the destination chain receiving a value that does not represent the user's net liquidity, only gross collateral, and leads to unsafe borrowing capacity checks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has supplied collateral on Chain A.

2. User has borrowed some amount of tokens on Chain A (tracked as same-chain borrow via borrowBalance).

3. User initiates a cross-chain borrow from Chain A to Chain B.



### External Pre-conditions

1. No specific external condition is required — this is purely internal logic.

2. The price oracles remain consistent across chains.



### Attack Path

1. User supplies $1000 worth of collateral on Chain A.

2. User borrows $600 worth of tokens on Chain A using same-chain borrow (not cross-chain).

3. User then calls borrowCrossChain() to borrow another $500 on Chain B.

4. The router on Chain A sends collateral = $1000 to Chain B without subtracting the $600 already borrowed.

5. Chain B compares $1000 ≥ $500 and allows the new borrow.

6. User ends up with $1100 borrowed backed by only $1000 in collateral — protocol is now undercollateralized.



### Impact

The protocol may become undercollateralized due to double counting of collateral. The user can borrow more than their true available liquidity across chains. The affected party is the protocol and all lenders, who are exposed to insolvency risk.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

On Chain A (source chain), in borrowCrossChain(), instead of using just collateral, compute net liquidity:
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    msg.sender,
    LToken(_lToken),
    0,
    0
);

uint256 netCollateral = collateral > borrowed ? collateral - borrowed : 0;
```
Then send netCollateral to the destination chain as the payload’s collateral field.
This ensures Chain B makes its decision based on the borrower's actual remaining capacity.
On Chain B, the netCollateral should be compared with only the value of payload.amount included.
