# Incomplete Cleanup Logic in `_updateRepaymentState`

## Finding description and impact

The `_updateRepaymentState` function handles borrower repayment and updates their state. When the repayment clears the full debt (`repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount`), the function removes the borrow position from `crossChainCollaterals` and conditionally removes the user from `userBorrowedAssets`.

Current logic:

```solidity
lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
}
```

This assumes that if the `userCrossChainCollaterals` array had a length of 1 before removal, then no positions will remain afterward. While usually correct, this logic skips re-checking the actual array length after the removal operation.

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L518-L522

Root cause:

The state check uses a pre-removal snapshot of `userCrossChainCollaterals.length`. It does not verify whether the array is actually empty after `removeCrossChainCollateral` is called.

Impact:

* A user may be incorrectly removed from `userBorrowedAssets` even if they still have active borrow positions
* This can lead to inconsistencies in borrow tracking
* May affect eligibility for rewards, collateral checks, or protocol safety logic

## mitigation

Update the logic to check the post-removal state directly:

```solidity
lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);

if (lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(borrower, _token).length == 0) {
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
}
```

This ensures cleanup actions only apply when the user's borrow positions are fully cleared.
