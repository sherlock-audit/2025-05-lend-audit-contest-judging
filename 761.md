# Reentrancy Vulnerability in borrow Function

### Summary

The borrow() function performs an external call to an untrusted address (msg.sender) before internal state is updated, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This opens the protocol to a reentrancy attack that could allow a malicious borrower to re-enter borrow() or other exposed methods, bypassing collateral checks, and stealing funds or inflating their borrow balance.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170

```solidity
// External call to send borrowed tokens
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);  //Reentrancy point

// Internal state update happens after
lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(...);
lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(...);
```

### Attack Path

1. - Attacker contract deposits collateral and gains borrowing power.
2. - Calls borrow(_amount, _token)
3. - Inside borrow(), the protocol:
4. - Validates collateral
5. - Calls IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount)
6. -This transfer triggers fallback in the attacker's contract.
7. - In fallback, attacker reenters borrow() again before lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(...) runs.
8. - The second call again validates collateral (unchanged), and:
9. - Transfers more tokens
10. - Adds more borrow amount to pending state update
11. - After the outer call returns, the borrowed amount is recorded only once â€” but multiple tokens were transferred.

### Impact

1. Attacker receives multiple loans of _amount, but internal storage reflects only one.
2. Results in borrow inflation, asset draining, or under-collateralized state.
3. If repeated, attacker could drain the lending pool entirely.


### Mitigation

1. Add nonReentrant Modifier
2. Apply Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern

Move all state updates before external calls:

```solidity
// Update borrow balance and internal state first
lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(...);
lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(...);

// THEN do external transfer
SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(_token), msg.sender, _amount);

```
