# Potential Underestimation of Cross-Chain Borrow Amount Due to Strict Collateral Filtering in borrowWithInterest

### Summary

The strict filtering condition in the borrowWithInterest function, which only counts cross-chain collateral borrows where both srcEid and destEid equal the current chain’s ID (currentEid), will cause an underestimation of total borrow amounts for borrowers. This can lead to incorrect liquidity calculations and risk assessments for users who have cross-chain collateral borrows that do not originate and settle on the same chain, as the function ignores such borrows during valuation.

### Root Cause

In borrowWithInterest (LendStorage.sol), the code enforces a filtering condition on collateral borrows requiring:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497

This means only collateral borrows initiated and posted on the current chain are counted. If collateral originated on a different chain (srcEid != currentEid), the function excludes it, even if the collateral is relevant to the borrower’s position on the current chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Cross-chain borrowing is enabled, allowing borrows and collateral to originate and be recorded across multiple chains.

The borrower has collateral borrows where srcEid != currentEid but destEid == currentEid or collateral borrows that involve multiple chains.

The protocol does not strictly enforce that all collateral borrows must have srcEid == destEid == currentEid.

### External Pre-conditions

Cross-chain messages or transactions can propagate borrow or collateral information asynchronously between chains.

User or protocol operations allow posting collateral or liquidations on chains different from the borrow origin.

### Attack Path

Borrower takes a cross-chain borrow, originating on Chain A (srcEid = A).

Collateral is posted or liquidated on Chain B (destEid = B), where B != A.

User queries liquidity on Chain B; borrowWithInterest excludes this collateral borrow because srcEid != currentEid.

The system underestimates the borrower’s total borrow balance, causing incorrect collateralization checks.

Borrower can over-borrow or evade liquidation due to flawed risk calculation.

### Impact

The protocol and borrowers face inaccurate liquidity and risk assessments.

Users may overborrow or avoid liquidation, increasing the protocol’s exposure to bad debt.

Liquidators and risk managers operate on incomplete data, weakening system robustness.

This leads to a systemic risk for solvency and potential financial loss for protocol stakeholders.

### PoC

Will provide a coded POC on request

### Mitigation

Clarify and enforce in protocol design that cross-chain collateral borrows must have srcEid == destEid == currentEid if this is an intended invariant.

Otherwise, modify filtering logic to include collateral borrows relevant to the current chain even if srcEid != currentEid. For example:


if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid) {
    // Include collateral regardless of srcEid, or apply more nuanced checks.
}
Add comprehensive multi-chain test cases simulating collateral borrows originating and posted on different chains to ensure correctness.

Add monitoring and alerts for invariant violations related to cross-chain borrow and collateral data.
