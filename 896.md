# Missing accrueInterest() call before computing liquidation limit causes stale debt calculations

### Summary

The liquidateCrossChain() function initiates liquidation logic that relies on the borrower's current debt calculated via borrowWithInterest(). However, none of the functions in the call chain (liquidateCrossChain → _validateAndPrepareLiquidation → getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount → borrowWithInterest) explicitly call accrueInterest() or ensure that the LToken’s borrowIndex is up to date. As a result, the borrow amount may be underestimated or overestimated, leading to incorrect enforcement of liquidation thresholds and protocol accounting errors.

### Root Cause

In [LendStorage.sol 490](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L490-L491)
                borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
    
The call chain initiating liquidation does not update the borrowIndex on the LToken contract before reading it. This causes borrowWithInterest() to use a potentially stale index value in its interest calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The LToken contract uses a borrowIndex to track interest accrual over time.

2. Interest accrual is done lazily and requires an explicit call to accrueInterest() or similar.

3. borrowWithInterest() depends on borrowIndex() to calculate total debt but does not update it internally.

4. getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount() uses borrowWithInterest() to determine the liquidation cap.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A borrower has a debt position with accumulated interest.

2. No recent operation (borrow, repay, or accrueInterest) has updated the borrowIndex on the corresponding LToken.

3. A liquidator attempts to liquidate the borrower's position using liquidateCrossChain().

### Attack Path

1. A borrower accrues interest over time, increasing their debt.

2. The LToken’s borrowIndex is not updated, as no function has triggered interest accrual.

3. A liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain() to liquidate part of the debt.

4. The liquidation logic calculates maxRepay using borrowWithInterest(), which uses the stale borrowIndex.

5. The protocol either:

-Underestimates the borrower’s current debt, reducing the allowed liquidation amount, or

-Overestimates it, allowing over-liquidation.



### Impact

1. Incorrect liquidation bounds: Borrowers may not be liquidated when eligible, weakening risk management.

2. Over-liquidation: Borrowers may be unfairly penalized if more debt is assumed than exists.

3. Protocol accounting drift: Total debt, interest, and revenue tracking may diverge from reality over time.

4. Security risk: May allow strategic borrowers or liquidators to game the system during low activity periods when indexes are stale.

### PoC

Assume:

1. Borrower takes 1000 USDC with borrowIndex = 1e18.

2. After time, true debt becomes 1100 USDC with borrowIndex = 1.1e18.

3. No one has called accrueInterest() on the LToken.

4. Liquidator calls:

    function liquidateCrossChain( address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, uint32 srcEid, address lTokenToSeize, address borrowedAsset
    )

5. Internally:

_validateAndPrepareLiquidation() -> getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount() -> borrowWithInterestSame()

6. borrowWithInterest() uses borrowIndex = 1e18, so it returns 1000 USDC.

7. maxRepay = 1000 * 0.5 = 500 USDC instead of correct 550 USDC.(if closeFactorMantissa = 0.5)

8. Result: Liquidator is blocked from repaying the correct max amount; borrower avoids proper liquidation.

### Mitigation

Ensure that accrueInterest() is called before reading borrowIndex() in the liquidation flow. The fix should be applied at the top of the call chain (liquidateCrossChain) to guarantee fresh interest state:

LTokenInterface(params.borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();


Place this call before invoking getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount inside _validateAndPrepareLiquidation() or at the start of liquidateCrossChain(). This ensures the system uses up-to-date interest data for all downstream calculations.
