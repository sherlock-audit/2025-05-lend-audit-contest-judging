# Protocol Rewards Are Permanently Locked

### Summary

The protocol reward tokens accrued from liquidations are recorded and accounted for but remain locked. There is no function allowing anyone to claim or withdraw these rewards, effectively making them permanently inaccessible. This leads to protocol rewards accumulating as idle underlying tokens without any mechanism to distribute or utilize them.

### Root Cause

Protocol rewards are updated and tracked during liquidation but there is no function or mechanism to claim or withdraw these accumulated rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Protocol rewards are intended as compensation to the protocol when a user is liquidated. However, since these rewards are neither claimable nor withdrawable, the protocol’s earnings remain permanently locked, effectively making the protocol’s seize mechanism useless.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a function to claim or withdraw the accumulated protocol rewards.
