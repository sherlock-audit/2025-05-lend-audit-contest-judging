# IERC20.transfer() not working for USDT, this affect redeem() function on CoreRouter.sol

### Summary

Based on contest README, Lend protocol will support `USDT` as asset (underlying token) :

> **If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?**
> 
> Whitelisted only (e.g BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT). ERC20 standard.

The problem arises when the user redeem `ltoken` for the underlying token, which is `USDT`. It can be seen in the `redeem()` function, `USDT` is transferred using the `IERC20.transfer()` function, which means that the function force `USDT` to have a return value in the form of a `boolean`, but the problem is that `USDT` does not have a return value in the form of a `boolean`, thus the `redeem()` function will always fail if the underlying token used is `USDT`.

### Root Cause

*In [CoreRouter.sol:124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124) using `IERC20.transfer` for transfering `USDT`*

### Impact

The `redeem()` function will always fail if the underlying token used is `USDT`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transfer()`
