# Cross-chain state desynchronization due to unrecoverable message failures

# Cross-chain state desynchronization due to unrecoverable message failures

## Summary
The fire-and-forget message handling in `CrossChainRouter`  will cause state inconsistency between chains  as any message failure in `_lzReceive()` causes the LayerZero v2 Endpoint to discard the payload with no recovery mechanism .

## Root Cause
- In [`src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol` `_lzReceive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L742-L768) the contract inherits plain `OApp` and executes message logic without a `try/catch` wrapper.
- LayerZero v2 treats a delivery as successful once `_lzReceive` is invoked; if the function reverts, the payload is **discarded forever** rather than queued for retry.
- No storage for failed messages and no retry mechanism exists in the contract.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. A LayerZero message is sent between chains through the `CrossChainRouter`.
2. The message handler contains code that can revert  .

## External Pre-conditions
1. Network congestion, gas price spikes,.

## Attack Path
1. A user initiates a cross-chain operation (borrow, repay, liquidate).
2. For the cross-chain borrow flow specifically:
   - First message: Chain A → Chain B (BorrowCrossChain)
   - Chain B executes `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`, mints tokens to user
   - Second message: Chain B → Chain A (ValidBorrowRequest)
   - Chain A should record the debt in `_handleValidBorrowRequest`
3. If the second message (ValidBorrowRequest) reverts on Chain A:
   - User already has tokens on Chain B
   - But Chain A never records the debt
   - LayerZero Endpoint marks the message as delivered despite the revert
   - The message payload is permanently lost with no way to retry
4. Similar issues occur with other flows:
   - For `DestRepay` failures: User has paid tokens on Chain B, but Chain A still shows the debt
   - For liquidation message failures: Partial state updates leave borrower and liquidator in inconsistent states

## Impact
The protocol suffers from:
1. **Accounting inconsistencies**: Debt exists on one chain but not the other.
2. **Potential insolvency**: Users may receive "free" tokens if debt records are not properly maintained.
3 Users may be unable to repay loans or recover collateral due to state mismatches.

Unlike in LayerZero v1, there is no automatic queue or retry mechanism in v2's default implementation, making these failures permanent without manual intervention.
