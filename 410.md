# Unchecked Return Values on enterMarkets Call

### Summary

In CoreRouter.sol the function enterMarkets() makes an external call and relies on return codes rather than using safe wrappers. It does not check the return values at all, potentially causing silent failures.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L431 
the "LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).enterMarkets(lTokens);" call’s return value is completely ignored. In the LendtrollerInterfaceV2 API, enterMarkets returns an array of uint256 error codes—each element indicates whether entering a specific market succeeded (0) or failed (non‐zero). By not reading or acting on that returned array, the router blindly assumes “we entered successfully” even if Lendtroller actually rejected the request. 
In short:

1.Incorrect API usage: The LendtrollerInterfaceV2 is designed to tell you “success” or “failure” via its return codes.

2.Missing validation: The code never does something like

`uint[] memory errors = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).enterMarkets(lTokens);
require(errors[0] == 0, "enterMarkets failed");
`

3.Consequence: If Lendtroller rejects the market entry (e.g. user has insufficient collateral or the market is paused), the router never notices and goes ahead with the borrow. That leaves the user un‐entered in the market—no on‐chain collateral is actually posted—yet the router behaves as if it were, producing undercollateralized positions.








### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Lendtroller reference is correctly set
In CoreRouter, the lendtroller state variable holds the address of a deployed Lendtroller contract that manages the _lToken market.

2. _lToken is a listed market in Lendtroller
The _lToken address passed into enterMarkets(_lToken) is already registered in Lendtroller’s markets mapping. Otherwise, enterMarkets would revert entirely rather than return an error code.

3. Borrower has no on-chain collateral recognized by Lendtroller
Up to this point, the borrower has not supplied any underlying collateral (or has insufficient collateral) to any LToken in that market. Consequently, Lendtroller’s internal checks (e.g. “does the borrower meet collateral requirements?”) will fail and cause enterMarkets to return a nonzero error code for that single-market array.

4. CoreRouter calls enterMarkets without capturing its return value
The internal function enterMarkets(address _lToken) internal {} runs with the borrower’s address as msg.sender in Lendtroller, but the returned uint256[] array (containing a nonzero error code) is never checked or stored.

5. Router proceeds to borrow despite “enterMarkets” failure.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market is registered in Lendtroller
The _lToken address must already be listed in the Lendtroller’s markets mapping. 

2. Borrower fails Lendtroller’s collateral checks
In Lendtroller’s internal logic, the borrower does not satisfy whichever condition is required to enter the market.

3. Lendtroller returns error code instead of reverting.

4. LToken’s borrow logic does not re‐check market entry on‐chain.

### Attack Path

1. Ensure the target market is live in Lendtroller
Confirm that the _lToken address you plan to borrow from is already listed in Lendtroller’s markets mapping, so calling enterMarkets([_lToken]) does not revert outright (it will return an error code instead).

2. Have no valid collateral on‐chain
Make sure your account has insufficient collateral (or none at all) in any market that Lendtroller would consider. Under normal circumstances, this means you would fail Lendtroller’s “collateral‐requirement” check for entering the market.

3. Invoke CoreRouter.borrow(...) via the router
Call the router’s borrow entry point (e.g. CoreRouter.borrow(_lToken, borrowAmount, ... )). Internally, the router performs two key steps in sequence:
  1.enterMarkets(_lToken)
  2.LendInterface(_lToken).borrow(borrowAmount)

4. Silent “enterMarkets” failure 
Inside enterMarkets(_lToken), the router does:
`address;
lTokens[0] = _lToken;
LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).enterMarkets(lTokens);
`
Because you didn’t meet collateral requirements, Lendtroller returns a nonzero array element (e.g. [1]) instead of 0, signaling “entry denied.”
Crucially, the router does not check or require that the returned code is 0. It simply moves on as if “enterMarkets” succeeded.

5. Router calls the underlying borrow
Next, the router executes:
`LendInterface(_lToken).borrow(borrowAmount);`
Because the LToken contract itself (per external preconditions) does not verify that you are a confirmed “member” of this market, it lets you borrow anyway—issuing borrowAmount tokens to your address.

6. Attacker receives borrowed tokens without collateral
On‐chain, Lendtroller still thinks you never entered the market (no collateral is locked). Meanwhile, you walk away with freshly minted borrow tokens.
You can now spend or swap these borrowed tokens freely, leaving the protocol with an undercollateralized liability it cannot recoup.

7. Protocol risk becomes misaligned
Because “enterMarkets” never took effect in Lendtroller’s state, there is no recorded collateral on‐chain to seize if you become undercollateralized.
If your position ever defaults, no on‐chain collateral is available for liquidation. The protocol cannot recover the borrowed funds, leading to potential losses or insolvency.

### Impact

1. Borrow allowed without valid collateral on record. The user can draw out borrowed funds, but on‐chain the protocol still thinks the user hasn’t posted collateral. In a liquidation event, the protocol’s risk calculations will be totally bogus, because they assume the user has collateral on file (via enterMarkets) when they don’t.

2. Undercollateralized positions. Because “enterMarkets” didn’t actually happen, the protocol’s internal bookkeeping never reserved collateral to back the loan. As soon as the user withdraws or manipulates other positions, the protocol can’t recover—there’s no collateral on‐chain to seize.

### Mitigation

Modify the internal enterMarkets function to:

1. Store the returned uint256[] array.

2. Immediately require that its only element is 0 (success).

3. Revert otherwise, so no borrow ever proceeds on a rejected market entry.
