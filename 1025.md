# Debt Not Properly Reduced During Liquidation

### Summary

Non-atomic cross-chain liquidation execution will cause loss of collateral without debt reduction for borrowers as failed inter-chain messaging leaves debt intact after collateral seizure.

### Root Cause

In [`CrossChainRouter._handleLiquidationExecute`,](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L312) collateral is seized immediately on the collateral chain before debt repayment is confirmed on the debt chain. The sequential processing creates a critical failure point where LayerZero message delivery might fail after collateral is already seized.
```solidity
// CrossChainRouter.sol
function _handleLiquidationExecute(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // SEIZE COLLATERAL FIRST (Chain A)
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken, ...);
    
    // THEN attempt repayment (Chain B)
    _send(ContractType.LiquidationSuccess); // @audit 
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Cross-chain liquidation initiated
2. Collateral chain (Chain A) successfully processes seizure
3. Debt chain (Chain B) experiences any of: - for example -  Insufficient gas for message, Network congestion

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain()
2. Collateral chain seizes assets
3. _send(LiquidationSuccess) fails due to network issue
4. Debt repayment never executes on debt chain
5. Borrower loses collateral but debt remains

### Impact

1. Borrowers lose collateral without debt reduction
2. Protocol accumulates bad debt

### PoC

Nil

### Mitigation

Implement atomic liquidation with fallback. e.g try catch
