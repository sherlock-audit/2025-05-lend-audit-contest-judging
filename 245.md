# CoreRouter.supply uses exchangeRateBefore to calculate the amount of lToken minted, but the mint operation changes the exchange rate.

### Summary

The use of an outdated exchange rate to compute mintTokens will cause inaccurate accounting for totalInvestment for users, as the supply() function calculates mintTokens before interest accrual while LToken.mint() internally updates the exchange rate, leading to users being credited more than they actually minted.

### Root Cause

In [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80), the code uses the pre-mint exchangeRate to calculate mintTokens, but the actual minting occurs after accrueInterest() is triggered within the LToken.mint() call, which updates the exchange rate. This causes a mismatch between expected and actual lToken minted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Attacker calls supply(_lToken, _amount)

exchangeRateBefore is read and used to compute mintTokens

mint() is called, which triggers accrueInterest(), increasing the exchange rate

user receives fewer lTokens than mintTokens computed

totalInvestment[user][lToken] is increased by an inflated value

Userâ€™s reward or accounting mechanisms that depend on totalInvestment are now manipulated

### Impact

The protocol suffers from overestimated user totalInvestment balances. This can:

allow users to claim higher rewards than they should

cause future redeem() calls to fail (due to insufficient lToken balance)

create inconsistencies between real asset balance and accounting records

If rewards are computed from totalInvestment, the attacker can inflate reward claims across multiple supply() and redeem() cycles.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

update the supply() logic to calculate mintTokens after minting, using the actual lToken.balanceOf(user) delta, rather than estimating with a stale exchangeRate.

uint256 before = lToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
require(lToken.mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 after = lToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
uint256 actualMinted = after - before;

// Now use actualMinted
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) +actualMinted);
