# Cross-chain TOCTOU - Liquidation Seize Amount Calculation and Execution

**Summary:** The amount of collateral to be seized during a cross-chain liquidation is calculated on the debt chain (Chain B) based on its local prices and sent as a fixed value to the collateral chain (Chain A) for execution. This is vulnerable to TOCTOU due to cross-chain price fluctuations during message transit.

**Vulnerability Detail:** When a liquidator initiates a cross-chain liquidation on Chain B, the `_executeLiquidationCore` function calculates the number of collateral tokens to seize (`seizeTokens`) based on Chain B's state and prices. This `seizeTokens` value is sent in a LayerZero message (`CrossChainLiquidationExecute`) to Chain A. The `_handleLiquidationExecute` function on Chain A directly uses this received `payload.amount` (the calculated `seizeTokens`) to perform the collateral seizure and distribution, without verifying the current value of these tokens on Chain A relative to the borrowed asset's value on Chain B.

**Impact:** If the price ratio between the borrowed asset (on Chain B) and the collateral asset (on Chain A) changes significantly during message transit, the liquidator will seize collateral on Chain A that has a different value than intended by the calculation on Chain B. This can lead to liquidators seizing too much (over-seizing) or too little (under-seizing) collateral, affecting liquidation profitability and potentially causing losses for liquidators or unfair outcomes for borrowers.

**Recommendation:** Implement a cross-chain price verification mechanism. Chain A should verify the current value of the collateral being seized against the value of the debt being repaid on Chain B using a reliable cross-chain oracle or by querying Chain B's state before executing the seizure.
