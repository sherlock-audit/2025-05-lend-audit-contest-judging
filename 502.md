# The _getBorrowDetails function retrieves only the first borrow position, leading to incomplete repayments or liquidations in cross-chain lending.

### Summary

In LendStorage.sol, the _getBorrowDetails function retrieves only the first matching borrow position for a given borrower, _token, and _srcEid. This will cause incomplete repayment or liquidation for users with multiple positions on the same chain (_srcEid) because the external-facing function repayCrossChainBorrowInternal depends on this private function to determine total borrow amount. As a result, debt underestimation leads to collateral mismanagement, financial loss for the protocol, and potentially unrecoverable debts.

### Root Cause

In _getBorrowDetails:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L405-L416

The loop stops at the first match and does not aggregate across all borrow positions for the borrower with the same srcEid.

This introduces an incomplete view of the borrow state if the borrower has multiple cross-chain positions for the same underlying token on a given chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1️⃣ A borrower opens multiple borrow positions for the same underlying token (_token) on the same chain (_srcEid).
2️⃣ The total outstanding borrow exceeds the amount recorded by _getBorrowDetails.
3️⃣ repayCrossChainBorrowInternal or a similar function calls _getBorrowDetails.

### External Pre-conditions

1️⃣ The borrower repays a partial amount or triggers a liquidation for one of their positions.
2️⃣ The protocol assumes the borrower has fewer debts than reality.

### Attack Path

1️⃣ Borrower takes multiple loans for the same asset on the same chain.
2️⃣ Borrower (or liquidator) initiates repayCrossChainBorrowInternal.

function repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(...) internal {
    (uint256 borrowedAmount, uint256 index, LendStorage.Borrow memory borrowPosition) = _getBorrowDetails(...);
    ...
    require(repayAmountFinal <= borrowedAmount, "Repay amount exceeds borrow");
    ...
}

3️⃣ _getBorrowDetails returns only one borrow position (the first match), ignoring others.
4️⃣ The function underestimates total debt, potentially allowing the borrower to:

Avoid repaying the full debt, leaving residuals.

Keep extra collateral that should have been seized.
5️⃣ Over time, the borrower could drain the protocol by accumulating small leftover debts across multiple positions.



### Impact

Protocol loss from unrecovered debt.

Liquidator losses from insufficient collateral seizure.

Increased insolvency risk if multiple borrowers exploit this behavior.

Systemic vulnerability as the residual debts compound.

### PoC

A user borrows USDC on Chain A using multiple positions:
1️⃣ Position A: 1,000 USDC, srcEid=1, borrowIndex=100
2️⃣ Position B: 500 USDC, srcEid=1, borrowIndex=110

When a repayment or liquidation is triggered:

The current code finds only Position A and calculates debt for it.

Position B is ignored, so:

500 USDC of debt remains.

This can cause partial liquidation.

User could still be under-collateralized and face another liquidation.

Or, liquidator might seize too little collateral, causing a loss to the protocol.

### Mitigation

nstead of break, continue scanning all positions:

Aggregate total borrowed amounts:

Sum all matching positions for the given token and chain (_srcEid).

Combine the calculations:

borrowedAmount += (borrowPosition.principle * currentBorrowIndex) / borrowPosition.borrowIndex;
