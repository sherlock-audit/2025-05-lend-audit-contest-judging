# Cross-chain execute liquidation logic is not working properly when receiving LZ messages

### Summary

Cross-chain execute liquidation logic is not working properly when receiving LZ messages

### Root Cause

When a cross-chain liquidation is initiated, after the liq. parameters are verified and prepared (interest accrued) the next step is to [send a message to the source chain with message type `CrossChainLiquidationExecute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L274-L283). The message is handled this [way](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L772-L777). But the problem is that in case if the initiated liquidation call is not valid (i.e the borrower's debt position is still healthy), it will send a `LiquidationFailure` type LZ message where it tries to return the underlying tokens of the liquidator:

```javascript
function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```
But the contract will not hold any funds, because they are transfered from the liquidator only upon `LiquidationSuccess`, which is happening only after the validation is successful (collateral < debt):

```javascript
function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Find the specific collateral record
        (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
            payload.sender,
            underlying,
            currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
            0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        );

        require(found, "Borrow position not found");

        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCollaterals = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(payload.sender, underlying);
        uint32 srcEid = uint32(userCollaterals[index].srcEid);

        // Now that we know the borrow position and srcEid, we can repay the borrow using the escrowed tokens
        // repayCrossChainBorrowInternal will handle updating state and distributing rewards.
        repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
            payload.sender, // The borrower
            payload.liquidator, // The liquidator (repayer)
            payload.amount, // Amount to repay
            payload.destlToken, // lToken representing the borrowed asset on this chain
            srcEid // The chain where the collateral (and borrow reference) is tracked
        );
    }
```
(`repayCrossChainBorrowInternal()` ends up calling CoreRouter's repay internal function where the transfer happens). Hence the call will revert, leading to DoS due to insufficient balance.
