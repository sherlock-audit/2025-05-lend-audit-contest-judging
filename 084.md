# Underestimated Liquidator Collateral Due to Missing Asset Tracking

### Summary

When a liquidator seizes collateral, the protocol updates their total investment balance but fails to record the newly acquired asset in their list of supplied assets if they hadn't previously supplied that specific asset type. This leads to an underestimation of the liquidator's true collateral, potentially preventing them from borrowing or redeeming funds, and falsely flagging them for liquidation.

### Root Cause

The `liquidateSeizeUpdate` function, responsible for transferring seized collateral to the liquidator, correctly updates the totalInvestment mapping for the liquidator's new collateral amount. However, it fails to call lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(sender, lTokenCollateral). The getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function, which is crucial for calculating a user's total collateral and borrow capacity, relies on the userSuppliedAssets list to identify all assets contributing to a user's collateral. If an lTokenCollateral is added to totalInvestment but not to userSuppliedAssets, it will be overlooked during liquidity calculations.
Similar issue also exist for cross-chain liquidations.

```solidity
     address sender,
        address borrower,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address borrowedlToken,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) internal {
       ...
        lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);

        // Distribute rewards
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, sender);
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, borrower);

        // Update total investment
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            borrower, lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) - seizeTokens
        );
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            sender,
            lTokenCollateral,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward)
        );

### Internal Pre-conditions

Liqudator didnt suply an asset to protocol
When Liqudator liquidated a position  liquidateSeizeUpdate function updates totalInvestment but omits adding the lTokenCollateral to the userSuppliedAssets list for the liquidator.
The getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function iterates through userSuppliedAssets to sum up collateral values, 

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

Liquidators may be unable to withdraw or borrow from the protocol as their colelteral amount would be less than real values
The protocol's internal health checks for liquidators become inaccurate and can cause unfair liqudations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a call to `lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset`  within the liquidateSeizeUpdate and `_handleLiquidationExecute` functions
