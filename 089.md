# There is no mechanism to withdraw protocol rewards and the funds will be locked.

### Summary

Users supply tokens to mint lTokens. CoreRouter mints the lTokens for the user.
During liquidation, the protocol get rewards in lTokens but there is no mechanism for the protocol owner to redeems the rewards.


### Root Cause

At `liquidateSeizeUpdate()`, the protocol get rewards. 
The value `currentReward` is deducted from totalInvestment.
This means protocol got some lTokens as rewards.
But there is no mechanism for the protocol owner to redeem these.

```solidity
// Update protocol reward
lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
```
```solidity
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    sender,
    lTokenCollateral,
    lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward) // @audit: currentReward is deducted from totalInvestment
);
```
