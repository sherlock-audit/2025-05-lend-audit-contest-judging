# Incorrectly Removing UserBorrowedAsset from the List

### Summary
In the current implementation, the `UserBorrowedAsset` is removed for both same-chain and cross-chain repayments when its remaining borrow amount reaches zero. As a result, when repaying cross-chain, even if there is an outstanding same-chain borrow, it is deleted from the list, and vice versa.

### Root Cause
The root cause is that the borrow token is registered in the same list for both same-chain and cross-chain borrows, however, if it is fully repaid in only one context, it is deleted from the list.

            if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
                lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
            }

```solidity
            if (userBorrows.length == 1) {
                lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(payload.sender, lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(payload.srcToken));
            }
```

```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        ...
492:    // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
500:    }
        ...
    }
```

1. The attacker supplies underlying assets on chain 1.
2. The attacker performs a same-chain borrow on chain 1.
3. The attacker performs a cross-chain borrow on chain 2 using underlying collateral from chain 1.
4. The attacker fully repays the cross-chain borrow.
5. The attacker redeems the underlying collateral.

In step 4, the UserBorrowedAsset is removed from the list, causing the attacker's same-chain borrow to also become to zero.

### Impact
The attacker can steal funds from this protocol.

### Mitigation
Consider treating `UserBorrowedAsset` separately for each same-chain and cross-chain transaction. 
Or when removing `UserBorrowedAsset` from the list, check the borrow balance for both same-chain and cross-chain.
