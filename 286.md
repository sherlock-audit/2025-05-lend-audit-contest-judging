# Cross-Chain Debt Tracking Failure Allows Unlimited Over-Borrowing

### Summary

A logical error in debt calculation will cause unlimited over-borrowing for users as attackers will exploit the cross-chain debt tracking mechanism to borrow beyond their collateral capacity by performing multiple cross-chain borrows from the same source chain.

### Root Cause

In [LendStorage.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L495-L501), `borrowWithInterest`,  the condition for including cross-chain debt in borrowing capacity calculations is logically impossible for legitimate cross-chain borrows:

```solidity
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
```

For cross-chain borrows:
- `destEid` = destination chain (where debt exists) 
- `srcEid` = source chain (where collateral exists)
- `currentEid` = current executing chain

The condition `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` means both source and destination chains must be the same as the current chain, which is impossible for cross-chain operations. This causes existing cross-chain debt to never be counted when calculating borrowing capacity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have collateral on the source chain (Chain A) worth at least the individual borrow amount
2. User needs to perform multiple cross-chain borrows from the same source chain to the same destination chain
3. The destination chain must have sufficient liquidity for each individual borrow

### External Pre-conditions

None required.

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDC as collateral on Ethereum (Chain A)
2. Alice calls `borrowCrossChain(1000, USDC, baseEid)` to borrow 1000 USDC on Base
   - Ethereum records: `crossChainBorrows[alice][USDC] = [1000 debt]`
   - Baserecords: `crossChainCollaterals[alice][USDC] = [1000 debt]`
3. Alice calls `borrowCrossChain(500, USDC, baseEid)` for a second borrow
4. On Base, `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` checks Alice's borrowing capacity:
   - Calls `borrowWithInterest()` to calculate existing debt
   - The condition `destEid == currentEid && srcEid == currentEid` fails (Ethereum â‰  Base)
   - Returns 0 existing debt instead of 1000 USDC
   - Approves 500 USDC borrow against 1000 USDC collateral
5. Base updates Alice's debt to 1500 USDC total
6. Confirmation sent to Ethereum, which blindly records the additional 500 USDC debt
7. Alice now has 1500 USDC debt against 1000 USDC collateral (150% over-borrowed)

### Impact

The attacker can borrow unlimited amounts as long as each individual cross-chain borrow doesn't exceed their collateral value.

The protocol suffers bad debt since the borrower's total debt exceeds their collateral value, potentially leading to protocol insolvency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the logical condition in `borrowWithInterest()` to properly account for cross-chain debt
