# Incorrect Check of BorrowedAmount When Cross-Chain Liquidation

### Summary
In the current implementation, cross-chain liquidation begins on Chain B. If the seize operation succeeds on Chain A (the source chain), the underlying tokens are transferred to the liquidator, and repayment is executed on Chain B (the destination chain). However, even if the seize operation is successful, the repayment may fail, allowing the liquidator to receive the underlying tokens from the liquidatee on Chain A without repaying the liquidatee's debt.

### Root Cause
The root cause is that during cross-chain repayment, there is a check of the `borrowedAmount`, which relies on collateral located in the current chain.

```solidity
    function repayBorrowInternal(
        ...
    ) internal {
        ...
        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
475:        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }

478:    require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");
        ...
    }
```

### PoC
The following code illustrates how the `borrowWithInterest` function calculates the total borrow using the collateral of the current chain:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
        return borrowedAmount;
    }
```

        // Find the specific collateral record
        (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
            payload.sender,
            underlying,
            currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
            0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        );

        require(found, "Borrow position not found");

        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCollaterals = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(payload.sender, underlying);
        uint32 srcEid = uint32(userCollaterals[index].srcEid);

        // Now that we know the borrow position and srcEid, we can repay the borrow using the escrowed tokens
        // repayCrossChainBorrowInternal will handle updating state and distributing rewards.
464:    repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
            payload.sender, // The borrower
            payload.liquidator, // The liquidator (repayer)
            payload.amount, // Amount to repay
            payload.destlToken, // lToken representing the borrowed asset on this chain
            srcEid // The chain where the collateral (and borrow reference) is tracked
        );

        external
    {

220:    repayBorrowInternal(_borrower, _liquidator, _amount, _lToken, false);
    }
```
The `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function calls the `repayBorrowInternal` function.

As can be seen, the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function call the `repayBorrowInternal` function.

Consider the following scenario:
Collateral factor = 0.85.
1. Alice has 1000 USDT on Chain A.
2. Alice performs a same-chain borrow on Chain B for 800 USDC.
3. Alice has no assets on Chain B, so there is no borrowing using Chain B's assets.
4. Over time, her debt increases to 900 USDC due to interest.
5. Bob initiates a cross-chain liquidation of Alice.
Even if Bob successfully seizes Alice's collateral on Chain A, the repayment on Chain B will fail because the `borrowedAmount` is zero.
As a result, Alice loses her collateral without any reduction in her debt.

### Impact
Even if the seize operation is successful on Chain A, the repayment could fail on Chain B. 
This means that while the liquidatee's collateral is seized, the liquidatee's debt remains unchanged.

### Mitigation
