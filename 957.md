# Incorrect Asset Tracking in CrossChainRouter Will Prevent Cross-Chain Borrowing (High)

### Summary

A logical error in asset tracking will cause cross-chain borrowing functionality to fail for users as the contract incorrectly records borrowed assets as supplied assets, preventing proper market entry and disrupting the borrowing process.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:130` , the `borrowCrossChain` function incorrectly calls `addUserSuppliedAsset()` instead of `addUserBorrowedAsset()`, causing borrowed assets to be tracked as supplied assets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* User needs to call `borrowCrossChain()` to initiate a cross-chain borrowing operation
* The user must not have previously supplied the token they're attempting to borrow (otherwise the issue would be masked)

### External Pre-conditions

None required.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` to borrow assets from another chain
2. The function incorrectly adds the borrowed token to the user's supplied assets list via `lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken)`
3. When the code checks if the market is entered with `isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)`, it returns true because the asset was incorrectly added to the supplied assets list
4. The critical `enterMarkets(_lToken)` call is skipped because of the condition `if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken))`
5. Without properly entering the market, subsequent operations in the borrowing process will fail or produce incorrect results
6. Additionally, the asset is never added to the user's borrowed assets list, causing accounting inconsistencies

### Impact

The users cannot successfully complete cross-chain borrowing operations. This is a critical functionality failure that renders the cross-chain borrowing feature unusable. Additionally, the incorrect asset tracking creates inconsistencies between the actual state of borrowed/supplied assets and what's recorded in the contract, potentially leading to further issues with liquidations, repayments, and interest calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect function call in `borrowCrossChain()` with the appropriate one:
```solidity
// Replace this line:
lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

// With:
lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
```
