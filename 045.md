# Liquidation function uses liquidator address instead of borrower address causing complete liquidation failure

## Description:
The `_updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation()` function in CrossChainRouter.sol contains a critical bug where it uses `msg.sender` (the liquidator) instead of `params.borrower` (the actual borrower being liquidated) when retrieving borrow positions from storage.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L287
```solidity
function _updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation(
    LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params,
    uint256 currentBorrowIndex
) private {
    LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(
        msg.sender,           // @audit uses liquidator address
        params.borrowedAsset
    );
    // Should be: params.borrower instead of msg.sender
}
```

This means the function attempts to retrieve and update the liquidator's borrow positions rather than the borrower's positions that should actually be liquidated.

## Attack path:
1. Alice has an undercollateralized position (borrower)
2. Bob calls the liquidation function to liquidate Alice (liquidator)
3. The `_updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation()` function is called with Alice's address in `params.borrower`
4. However, the function uses `msg.sender` (Bob's address) to retrieve borrow positions
5. The function gets Bob's borrow positions instead of Alice's
6. If Bob has no borrows in that asset, the function receives an empty array
7. Alice's undercollateralized position remains unchanged and unliquidated
8. The protocol accumulates bad debt as risky positions cannot be liquidated

## Impact:
Complete liquidation mechanism failure: Undercollateralized positions cannot be liquidated properly
Bad debt accumulation: The protocol will accumulate bad debt from positions that should have been liquidated
Protocol insolvency risk: Inability to liquidate risky positions threatens the protocol's solvency

## Recommended Mitigation:
Change `msg.sender` to `params.borrower` in the `_updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation()` function call
