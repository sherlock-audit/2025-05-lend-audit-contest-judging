# M1-Incorrect Cross-Chain Borrow Logic Allows Miscalculation of Debt.  LendStorage.sol Line #488 & Line #496

### Summary

The `borrowWithInterest()` function in the contract contains flawed logic for calculating cross-chain borrows. The condition `srcEid == currentEid` incorrectly filters borrows, leading to potential undercounting of debt when loans originate on a different chain (srcEid != currentEid). This breaks the invariant that borrows and collaterals should never coexist for the same token.



### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L489?plain=1

1. Incorrect Borrow Validation:

The function checks `borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid` to determine if a borrow should be counted, but this excludes valid cross-chain borrows where `srcEid` (origin chain) is not the current chain.

Similarly, the collateral check `(collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid)` is overly restrictive, likely intended to prevent double-counting but incorrectly filters legitimate cross-chain activity.

2. Invariant Misalignment:

The require statement enforces that only one of borrows or collaterals is populated, but the logic fails to account for borrows originating on other chains (which should still be included in the debt calculation).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract tracks cross-chain borrows and collaterals in two separate mappings:

`crossChainBorrows[borrower][token]`

`crossChainCollaterals[borrower][token]`

2. The `currentEid` (current chain ID) must differ from `srcEid` (origin chain ID) for cross-chain borrows.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A borrower must have initiated a cross-chain borrow on a chain where `srcEid != currentEid`.

2. The protocol assumes borrows and collaterals are mutually exclusive (enforced by the require), but the logic does not uphold this for all cases.



### Attack Path

Scenario:

Alice borrows 100 USDC on Chain A (srcEid = A), collateralizing on Chain B (destEid = B).

The borrow is recorded in crossChainBorrows on Chain A and crossChainCollaterals on Chain B.

Exploit:

When borrowWithInterest() is called on Chain B, the function checks `collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` (which fails because srcEid = A).

The borrow is excluded from the debt calculation, even though it is valid and active.

Alice’s total debt is undercounted, allowing her to borrow more than she should or avoid liquidation.

### Impact

1. Financial Loss: Underreported debt leads to insufficient collateralization, risking protocol insolvency.

2. Liquidation Avoidance: Borrowers may evade liquidation by exploiting the miscalculation.

3. Invariant Violation: The system’s assumption that borrows and collaterals are mutually exclusive is broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the Logic:

For `borrows[]`: Include borrows where either `srcEid` or `destEid` matches `currentEid`.

For `collaterals[]`: Remove the redundant `srcEid == currentEid` check (only check destEid).
