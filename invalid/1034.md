# Deprecated Market Liquidation Protection Bypass

### Summary

The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function skips critical liquidation protection checks if a market is deprecated, allowing potentially unfair liquidations of borrower positions.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L329C4-L362C1

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Market must be marked as deprecated in Lendtroller
- Borrower must have an existing loan
- Liquidator must have sufficient tokens to repay
- No grace period implemented for deprecated markets

### External Pre-conditions

- Market deprecation can be triggered by protocol admins
- No transition period between active and deprecated states
- No notification system for borrowers

### Attack Path

```solidity
contract DeprecatedMarketAttack {
    CoreRouter public router;
    address public targetMarket;
    
    function executeAttack(address borrower) external {
        // 1. Wait for market deprecation
        require(isDeprecated(targetMarket), "Market not deprecated");
        
        // 2. Calculate maximum liquidatable amount
        uint256 borrowBalance = getBorrowerBalance(borrower);
        
        // 3. Liquidate without normal checks
        router.liquidateBorrow(
            borrower,
            borrowBalance,  // Can liquidate full amount
            collateralToken,
            borrowedAsset
        );
        // No checks for:
        // - Borrower health factor
        // - Maximum liquidation amount (closeFactor)
        // - Price impact
    }
}
```

### Impact

- Borrowers can be liquidated even when their position is healthy
- No limitation on liquidation size (closeFactor ignored)
- Potential flash loan attacks to maximize liquidation profit
- Loss of user funds through unfair liquidations
- Reduced trust in protocol
