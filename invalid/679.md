# Missing CrossChainBorrow Event Emission in borrowCrossChain Function - Breaks Cross-Chain Operation Monitoring and Integration

## Summary
The `borrowCrossChain` function in [1](#2-0)  fails to emit the defined `CrossChainBorrow` event [2](#2-1) , creating an incomplete audit trail for cross-chain borrowing operations and breaking external system integrations.

## Vulnerability Details
The `CrossChainBorrow` event is properly defined in the contract but is never emitted anywhere in the codebase. When users call `borrowCrossChain()`, the function performs all necessary validations and sends cross-chain messages but fails to emit the initiation event. This creates a gap in the event flow where only the completion event (`BorrowSuccess`) is emitted on the destination chain without any corresponding initiation tracking on the source chain.

## Root Cause
**Missing event emission statement** in the `borrowCrossChain` function. The developer defined the event signature but forgot to add the `emit CrossChainBorrow(msg.sender, destLToken, _amount, currentEid);` statement before or after the `_send()` call.

## Impact

### Affected Functions and Systems:
1. **`borrowCrossChain` function** - Primary affected function missing event emission
2. **`_handleValidBorrowRequest` function** - Only emits `BorrowSuccess` [3](#2-2)  without corresponding initiation event
3. **External monitoring systems** - Cannot track cross-chain borrow initiations
4. **Frontend applications** - Cannot provide real-time status updates for pending operations
5. **Analytics platforms** - Missing data for cross-chain borrow attempt metrics

### Specific Impacts:
- **Monitoring Gap**: Protocol operators cannot distinguish between failed cross-chain requests and requests that were never initiated
- **User Experience**: Users cannot track transaction status from initiation, only seeing completion events
- **Integration Failures**: External indexers, subgraphs, and analytics platforms miss critical initiation data
- **Debugging Complications**: Support teams cannot verify if users properly initiated cross-chain borrow requests
- **Incomplete Audit Trail**: Cross-chain operations lack complete event logging for compliance and monitoring

### Severity: Medium
- No direct financial loss occurs
- Core functionality still works but with reduced visibility
- Affects multiple stakeholders and integration points
- Breaks expected protocol behavior patterns
-

## Conclusion
This bug represents a significant operational issue that breaks the expected event emission pattern for cross-chain operations. While it doesn't cause direct financial harm, it severely impacts protocol monitoring, user experience, and external integrations. The fix is straightforward - adding the missing `emit CrossChainBorrow(msg.sender, destLToken, _amount, currentEid);` statement in the `borrowCrossChain` function.
