# H-1:Misuse of Aggregated Borrowed Value Leads to Debt Miscalculation--Debt and Liquidity Miscalculation

##  High


**Description:**

The protocol incorrectly calculates a user’s debt for a specific token by scaling the total USD borrowed value (across all markets) using the borrowIndex of an individual lToken. This logic appears in the borrow() and liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal() functions of the CoreRouter contract.

This creates a unit mismatch: the USD-denominated aggregate borrow value is incorrectly scaled using the interest index of just one market, leading to inaccurate assessments of a user's debt in that specific token. The outcome is either over-inflated debt (blocking legitimate actions) or understated debt (risking insolvency).

**Proof of Concept:**
1. 
Bob has $200 in ETH as collateral.

He has borrowed:

$50 in USDC at borrowIndex = 1.0

$50 in DAI at borrowIndex = 1.0

Total borrowed (via getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral) = $100 (USD).

USDC borrowIndex increases to 1.10, while DAI's remains at 1.0.

Bob attempts to borrow more USDC. Internally, the following calculation occurs:

```solidity
// Aggregated USD borrowed across all assets
borrowed = 100e18;

// USDC-specific indices
currentBorrow.borrowIndex = 1.0e18;
newBorrowIndex = 1.1e18;

// Faulty logic: applies USDC's index to total borrowed USD
borrowAmount = (borrowed * newBorrowIndex) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex; // = 110e18
```
Bob’s actual USDC debt with interest is $55 (i.e., 50 * 1.1), but the protocol incorrectly evaluates it as $110.

2.When evaluating collateral:

```solidity
require(collateral >= 110e18, "Insufficient collateral");
```
Result:

Bob is falsely denied a valid borrow.

Alternatively, Bob could be prematurely or unfairly liquidated.

**Affected Functions:**

1. borrow() — CoreRouter.sol
[`CoreRouter.sol#L145`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#145)
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;

require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

2. liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal() — CoreRouter.sol

Likely contains similar scaling of total borrowed USD with per-token borrow indices, leading to incorrect liquidation allowances.


**Impact :** 

Debt Accounting  >> Misrepresents true per-market debt values.
Liquidation Risk  >> Can trigger unfair liquidations or delays in proper ones.
Borrow Blocking  >>  Prevents users from borrowing even when sufficiently collateralized.
Protocol Insolvency  >>  Risk of undercollateralized positions bypassing checks.

**Remediation:**

Do not apply market-specific borrowIndex to aggregated USD values.

Instead, use per-token borrow balance (already interest-indexed) directly:
```solidity
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

uint256 actualDebt = (currentBorrow.principal * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex;
```
Then compare that value against collateral:
```solidity
require(collateralValueUSD >= tokenDebtUSD, "Insufficient collateral");
```
Preserve getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() for system-wide liquidity checks only — not per-token debt calculations.
