# Unauthorized Cross-Chain Borrowing

### Summary

The `borrowForCrossChain` function allows borrowing on behalf of any address without proper authorization checks

### Root Cause

```solidity

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L195C2-L206C1

function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
    external
{
    require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
    require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
    IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
}
```
The function only checks if caller is crossChainRouter but doesn't verify if the borrower has authorized the transaction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- CrossChainRouter must be set
- Caller must be the CrossChainRouter
- Sufficient liquidity in the protocol

### External Pre-conditions

- Compromised or malicious CrossChainRouter
- No borrower signature verification

### Attack Path

1. Attacker gains control of CrossChainRouter
2. Attacker calls borrowForCrossChain with any victim address
3. Borrow tokens on behalf of victim
4. Tokens are transferred to specified address
5. Victim's account accrues debt without consent


### Impact

- Unauthorized debt creation
- Potential loss of user funds through forced liquidation
- Protocol reputation damage
- Legal implications

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
contract CoreRouter {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public borrowApprovals;
    
    function approveCrossChainBorrow(address router, bool approved) external {
        borrowApprovals[msg.sender][router] = approved;
    }
    
    function borrowForCrossChain(
        address _borrower, 
        uint256 _amount, 
        address _destlToken, 
        address _destUnderlying,
        bytes memory signature // Borrower's signature
    ) external {
        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
        require(borrowApprovals[_borrower][msg.sender], "Not authorized");
        require(verifyBorrowerSignature(_borrower, _amount, _destlToken, signature), "Invalid signature");
        
        // ... rest of the function
    }
}
