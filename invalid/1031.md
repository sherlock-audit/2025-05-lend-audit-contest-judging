# M2: Incorrect Collateralization Check Allows Over-Borrowing in CoreRouter.sol

### Summary

The condition `collateral >= borrowed` in the lending protocol incorrectly permits users to borrow up to 100% of their collateral value, violating the fundamental lending principle that collateral must exceed borrowed amounts to maintain a safety margin (e.g., 110% collateralization). This flaw risks undercollateralized loans and protocol insolvency.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L112?plain=1

Logical Error:

The check collateral >= borrowed allows collateral == borrowed, meaning a borrower can have zero safety margin.

Proper lending protocols enforce collateral > borrowed * collateralFactor (e.g., collateralFactor = 1.1 for 110% collateralization).

Missing Collateral Factor:

No variable or constant adjusts the strictness of collateral requirements (e.g., 110% for volatile assets).

### Internal Pre-conditions

Attacker only needs to borrow same amount of collateral

### External Pre-conditions

no conditions 

### Attack Path

 Attack Scenario (Basic Exploit)
An attacker exploits the collateral >= borrowed check to borrow 100% of their collateral value, intentionally creating a position that is instantly liquidatable if the collateral depreciates even slightly.

Steps:

Deposit Collateral:

Attacker deposits 100 USDC as collateral.

Borrow 100% of Collateral:

Since collateral (100) >= borrowed (100), the protocol allows borrowing 100 USDC.

Collateral Depreciation:

If USDC depegs to 99 USDC (1% drop), the loan is now undercollateralized (99 < 100).

Avoid Repayment:

The attacker defaults, leaving the protocol with a bad debt of 1 USDC per loan.



### Impact

Undercollateralized Loans: Borrowers can take loans equal to 100% of collateral, leaving no buffer for price fluctuations.

Liquidation Failures: If collateral value drops even slightly, loans become instantly undercollateralized with no time for liquidations.

Protocol Insolvency: Accumulated bad debt from unsecured loans risks draining protocol reserves.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use Industry Standards:

Implement dynamic factors (e.g., higher for volatile assets).
