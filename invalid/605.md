# M-1: Stuck LEND Rewards

## Severity: Medium


Summary:

The core issue lies in the grantLendInternal function within CoreRouter. When a user's accrued LEND rewards (lendAccrued[user]) exceed the CoreRouter's LEND token balance, the function silently fails to transfer the tokens without updating the user's accrued rewards. Consequently, users are unable to claim their rewards, leading to a persistent accumulation of unclaimable tokens.

Affected Components:

CoreRouter.sol  =>> grantLendInternal(), claimLend()

LendStorage.sol ==>  lendAccrued mapping ,  distributeBorrowerLend() ,  distributeSupplierLend()

CrossChainRouter.sol ==> Functions interacting with distributeBorrowerLend and distributeSupplierLend

**Detailed Analysis** :

1. grantLendInternal Function
Location: CoreRouter.sol

```
function grantLendInternal(address user, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
    address lendAddress = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).getLendAddress();
    uint256 lendBalance = IERC20(lendAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount > 0 && amount <= lendBalance) {
        IERC20(lendAddress).safeTransfer(user, amount);
        return 0;
    }
    return amount;
}
```
Issue:   If amount > lendBalance, the function returns the amount without performing any transfer or updating the lendAccrued mapping.

This leads to the user's accrued rewards remaining unchanged, causing them to be perpetually unclaimable.

2.  claimLend Function
Location: CoreRouter.sol

```
function claimLend(address[] memory holders, LToken[] memory lTokens, bool borrowers, bool suppliers) external {
    LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).claimLend(address(this));
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < lTokens.length;) {
        address lToken = address(lTokens[i]);
        if (borrowers) {
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
                lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(lToken, holders[j]);
                unchecked { ++j; }
            }
        }
        if (suppliers) {
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
                lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lToken, holders[j]);
                unchecked { ++j; }
            }
        }
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
    for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
        uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
        if (accrued > 0) {
            grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
        }
        unchecked { ++j; }
    }
}
```
Issue:    The function calls grantLendInternal but ignores its return value.

If grantLendInternal fails to transfer tokens (due to insufficient balance), the lendAccrued mapping remains unchanged, leaving rewards stuck.

3.   distributeBorrowerLend and distributeSupplierLend Functions
Location: LendStorage.sol

```
function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external onlyAuthorized {
    // ... calculations ...
    lendAccrued[borrower] = borrowerAccrued;
}
```
Issue:  These functions correctly calculate and update the lendAccrued mapping.

However, they lack a mechanism to adjust lendAccrued when transfers fail, contributing to the accumulation of unclaimable rewards.

Proof of Concept (PoC) : 

```
Initial State:

CoreRouter holds 100 LEND tokens.

User Action:

User Alice accrues 150 LEND tokens through lending activities.

Execution:

Alice calls claimLend.

Outcome:

grantLendInternal detects that 150 > 100 and returns 150 without transferring tokens.

claimLend ignores the return value, and lendAccrued[Alice] remains at 150.

Alice receives no tokens, and her rewards are stuck indefinitely.
```

Impact Assessment : 

Users are unable to claim their earned rewards, leading to dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust in the protocol.

The core lending functionalities remain unaffected, but the reward mechanism's failure can deter user engagement.
