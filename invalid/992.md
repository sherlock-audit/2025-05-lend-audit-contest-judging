# Flash Loan Attack Vulnerability in Supply Function

### Summary

The `supply()` function is vulnerable to flash loan attacks due to improper balance checks and exchange rate manipulation

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61C5-L93C1

```solidity
function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ...existing code...
    uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
    uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
    // ...existing code...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Contract must be in active state
- `supply()` function must be callable by any external address
- `exchangeRateStored()` function is accessible and returns a non-zero value
- No minimum holding time requirement implemented
- No flash loan detection mechanisms present
- Token approvals are automatically granted
- No slippage protection implemented

### External Pre-conditions

- Flash loan provider (like Aave or dYdX) must be available on the same chain
- Token being supplied must be available for flash loans
- Token must have sufficient liquidity in flash loan providers
- Gas costs for the attack must be lower than potential profit
- Network must have enough block gas limit to execute the attack in one transaction

### Attack Path

1. Attacker takes flash loan
2. Manipulates exchange rate through large deposits
3. Calls supply() during manipulation
4. Receives more lTokens than they should
5. Repays flash loan with profit


### Impact

- Protocol insolvency
- Theft of user funds
- Market manipulation
