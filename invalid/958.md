# Flawed Reward Distribution in Liquidations

### Summary

In the `repayBorrowInternal` function, rewards are incorrectly distributed to borrowers when their loans are repaid by liquidators, creating an unfair economic model and potential manipulation opportunities.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459

```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(
    address borrower,
    address liquidator,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _lToken,
    bool _isSameChain
) internal {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Incorrect: Borrower gets rewards even when liquidator repays
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);
    
    // ...existing code...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Liquidation event is occurring
- Borrower has an outstanding loan
- Protocol has rewards available for distribution

### External Pre-conditions

- Market conditions warrant liquidation
- Liquidator has sufficient funds to repay
- Borrower position is eligible for liquidation

### Attack Path

1. Borrower intentionally becomes under-collateralized
2. Coordinates with friendly liquidator
3. Liquidator repays loan
4. Borrower receives rewards for the repayment
5. Process can be repeated for farming rewards

### Impact

- Unfair reward distribution
- Economic model manipulation
- Potential reward farming exploits
- Reduced protocol sustainability
- Misaligned incentives
