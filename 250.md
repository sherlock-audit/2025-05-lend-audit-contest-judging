# Double-counting interest in liquidation logic can cause wrongful liquidations of healthy accounts

### Summary

The liquidation logic in `CoreRouter `applies interest accrual to the user's borrow amount a second time, even though the borrow amount already includes accrued interest. This double-counting exaggerates the user's debt, making healthy accounts appear undercollateralized and subject to wrongful liquidation.

### Root Cause

In the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, the borrowed amount is calculated as:
```solidity
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```


However, the `borrowed `value is already obtained from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which includes all borrows (cross-chain and same-chain) and already accounts for interest accrual. By applying the borrow index scaling again, the code double-counts interest for all borrows. This results in an inflated borrow amount, causing the protocol to treat healthy accounts as if they are undercollateralized.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has an open borrow position and is subject to liquidation checks.


### External Pre-conditions

The borrow index has increased since the user's last borrow or interest accrual.

### Attack Path

1. User opens a borrow position and maintains healthy collateralization.
2. As interest accrues, the borrow index increases.
3. When liquidation is checked, the protocol double-counts interest, exaggerating the user's debt.
4. The user is flagged as undercollateralized and can be liquidated, even though their position is actually safe.

### Impact

Users may be wrongfully liquidated even when their accounts are healthy. This can result in loss of user funds, protocol instability, and loss of trust in the system. The protocol's liquidation and health check logic becomes unreliable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the redundant borrow index scaling from the liquidation logic. Use the value returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral `directly, as it already includes all necessary interest accrual.
