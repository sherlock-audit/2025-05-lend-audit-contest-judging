# Hardcoded LayerZero Endpoint IDs Limit Protocol Adaptability


*Protocol administrators will be unable to adapt to network changes as endpoint IDs are immutable*

## Summary

*Hardcoded and immutable LayerZero endpoint IDs will cause operational inflexibility for protocol administrators as they will be unable to update endpoint configurations when LayerZero evolves without full contract redeployment*

## Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:28-87` the endpoint ID is set as an immutable variable during construction:

```solidity
// Line 28
uint32 public immutable currentEid;

// Constructor (lines 73-88)
constructor(
    address _endpoint,
    address _delegate,
    address _lendStorage,
    address _priceOracle,
    address _lendtroller,
    address payable _coreRouter,
    uint32 _srcEid
) OApp(_endpoint, _delegate) {
    require(_lendStorage != address(0), "Invalid storage address");
    lendStorage = LendStorage(_lendStorage);
    priceOracle = _priceOracle;
    lendtroller = _lendtroller;
    coreRouter = _coreRouter;
    currentEid = _srcEid;
}
```

The choice to use an immutable variable for the endpoint ID is a mistake as it prevents the protocol from adapting to changes in the LayerZero network without redeploying contracts. This directly contradicts LayerZero's own integration recommendations which explicitly state to ["Avoid Hardcoding LayerZero Endpoint IDs"](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/integration-checklist#avoid-hardcoding-layerzero-endpoint-ids).

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. `CrossChainRouter` contract needs to be deployed with a specific `_srcEid` value that corresponds to the current LayerZero endpoint ID
2. Protocol needs to operate across multiple chains with different endpoint IDs

## External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero needs to update their endpoint IDs or introduce new chains
2. LayerZero needs to deprecate or change an existing endpoint ID that the protocol uses

## Attack Path

This is not an attack vector but rather a protocol limitation:

1. LayerZero updates their endpoint ID configuration or adds new chains
2. Protocol administrators cannot update the `currentEid` as it's immutable
3. Protocol administrators are forced to deploy new contracts to support the changes
4. During the transition, cross-chain operations may fail or be unavailable
5. Users experience service disruption during contract redeployment and migration

## Impact

The protocol suffers operational inflexibility and potential downtime. Administrators must redeploy contracts and migrate state when LayerZero makes network changes, potentially disrupting user experience and increasing operational costs.

## Mitigation

Replace the immutable endpoint ID with an admin-configurable mapping:

```solidity
// Instead of immutable
mapping(uint32 => bool) public supportedEndpoints;
uint32 public currentEid; // Remove immutable keyword

// Add admin functions to update
function setEndpointId(uint32 _eid, bool _supported) external onlyOwner {
    supportedEndpoints[_eid] = _supported;
}

function updateCurrentEid(uint32 _newEid) external onlyOwner {
    require(supportedEndpoints[_newEid], "Endpoint not supported");
    currentEid = _newEid;
}
```

This change allows the protocol to adapt to network changes without requiring full contract redeployment, improving operational flexibility and reducing potential downtime.
