```solidity
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");

The protocol allows to  provide collateral  and borrow with no minimum borrow amount and minimum collateral. As such, multiple low value collaterals and borrows may exist. However, there is no incentive to liquidate such low borrows because of gas cost.As this protocol will be deployed on gas expensive chains like ethereum, BNB. Liquidators liquidate users for the profit they can make. If there is no profit to be made than there will be no one to call the liquidate function.For example a borrow position could exist with low collateral value.This user is undercollateralized and must be liquidated in order to ensure that the protocol remains overcollateralized.If a liquidator wishes to liquidate this user, he should call either liquidateBorrow or liquidateCrossChain which involves gas cost.Because the value of the collateral is so low, after gas costs, liquidators will not make a profit liquidating this user. In the end these low value borrow positions  will never get liquidated, leaving the protocol with bad debt and can even cause the protocol to be undercollateralized with enough small value accounts being underwater.

### Root Cause

There is no mincollateral and minborrow amounts required implemented make it difficult to liquidate small borrow positions due to heavy gas costs.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

users borrowing with very less collateral and small borrow positions.

### Impact

The protocol can go underwater,  loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement mincollateral and minborrow amounts required, such that  users can't create very small borrrow positions.
