# Failed USDC Transfers Due to Blacklisting

## Title
Failed USDC Transfers Due to Blacklisting

## Summary
The `redeem()` functions allows users to redeem the lTokens for underlying tokens and transfers them. However this function fails to handle blacklisted USDC addresses properly, preventing users from redeeming their `lTokens` when the underlying asset (USDC) enforces compliance restrictions. This creates a permanent lock on user funds if their address is blacklisted by centralized stablecoin issuers.

## Root Cause
The [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100-L138) function blindly attempts to transfer USDC to the user without first verifying if the recipient is blacklisted.
```solidity
        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
When a user is blacklisted by `USDC`, the `transfer` call fails

## Internal Pre-conditions
Borrower has an open USDC-denominated debt position.
Borrower’s address is blacklisted by USDC.
Borrower calls `repayBorrow()`

## Internal Pre-Conditions
The underlying token must implement blacklisting (e.g., USDC).
User must have a positive `lToken` balance.
The `redeem()` function must be called by the blacklisted user.

## External Pre-Conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. Deposits `1000 USDC` and receives `lUSDC` tokens.
2. Their address is added to USDC’s blacklist.
3. User Calls `redeem()` function.
4. The contract calculates the owed USDC and attempts to transfer it but it fails due to the user being blacklisted
5. The user retains `lUSDC` but cannot access the underlying USDC. 


## Impact
Permanent loss of funds for blacklisted users

## POC
1. Modify `ERC20Mock.sol` as follows:
```diff
    contract ERC20Mock is ERC20 {
+       mapping(address => bool) public isBlacklisted;

        constructor() ERC20("ERC20Mock", "E20M") {}

        function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external {
            _mint(account, amount);
        }

        function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external {
            _burn(account, amount);
        }

        // Add these functions
+       function setBlacklist(address user, bool status) external {
+           isBlacklisted[user] = status;
+       }

+       function _beforeTokenTransfer(
+           address from,
+           address to,
+           uint256 amount
+       ) internal override {
+           require(!isBlacklisted[from], "USDC: sender blacklisted");
+           require(!isBlacklisted[to], "USDC: recipient blacklisted");
+           super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
+       }
    }
```

2. Add the following test in test/TestRedeeming.t.sol:
```solidity
    function test_redeem_fails_for_token_balcklisted_users(uint256 amount) public {
        vm.assume(amount > 1e18 && amount < 1e36);
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // First supply tokens
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

        // Get initial balances
        uint256 initialUnderlyingBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);
        uint256 initialLTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);

        // deployer gets blacklisted by USDC
        ERC20Mock(token).setBlacklist(deployer, true);

        // should have been blacklisted
        assertEq(ERC20Mock(token).isBlacklisted(deployer), true);

        // Expect revert due to blacklisting
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("USDC: recipient blacklisted"));

        coreRouter.redeem(initialLTokenBalance, payable(lToken));

        uint256 finalUnderlyingBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);
        uint256 finalLTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);

        // assert no change
        assertEq(finalUnderlyingBalance, initialUnderlyingBalance);
        assertEq(finalLTokenBalance, initialLTokenBalance);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Mitigation
Allow users to specify their alternative recipients
