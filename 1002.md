# Unhandled Bad Debt in the Liquidation Flow

### Summary

When bad debt is accumulated in the protocol, it is not accounted for.

The liquidation process in the lending protocol does not verify whether the seized collateral is sufficient to cover the borrower’s outstanding debt. If a borrower's position is severely undercollateralized, the system allows partial or full repayment by the liquidator and proceeds with collateral seizure. However, it fails to account for any remaining unpaid debt (“bad debt”) or prevent liquidators from overpaying relative to seized collateral value, resulting in potential protocol loss or liquidator loss.

In the case where the protocol intends to liquidate a bad position, bad debt accumulated is not accounted for.

### Root Cause

The function [_executeLiquidationCore()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L264) calculates the number of tokens to seize using `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens()` based on a repayAmount, without verifying whether the value of the seized collateral is greater than or equal to the repayAmount.

There is no accounting mechanism if the borrower's debt exceeds the collateral value.
In `handleLiquidationExecute()`, it goes on to execute the liquidation without accounting for the bad debt. 

When a liquidator carries out this operation, the liquidator risks losing his funds.

Also, In the case of the protocol performing liquidation, bad debt could still be accumulated after the liquidation without being accounted for.  This still leaves bad debt in the system.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower's position exists on the current chain and is eligible for liquidation.

2. Borrow index and principal have been updated to reflect accrued interest.

3. Liquidation parameters (borrowed asset, collateral asset, etc.) have been validated.

### External Pre-conditions

The borrower's collateral has significantly depreciated in value.


### Attack Path

1. A borrower’s debt exceeds the value of their collateral.

2. A liquidator or protocol initiates liquidateCrossChain(...) with a valid repayAmount.

3.` _prepareLiquidationValues()` calculates debt and max repay amount, but does not compare against current collateral value.

4. `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens()` computes seizeTokens.

5. The protocol seizes tokens and proceeds to call repayBorrowInternal(...).

6. Remaining debt when undercollaterized, is silently ignored—no badDebt state is recorded.

7. Liquidator pays more than the seized collateral is worth, incurring a net loss.

8. In the case of the protocol performing liquidation, bad debt could still be accumulated after the liquidation without being accounted for.

9.  The first suppliers to redeem will experience 0 loss, while the last ones to redeem will experience a severe loss.



### Impact

1. The remaining unpaid debt is not tracked, leading to inaccurate accounting of outstanding liabilities.
2. Without badDebt tracking, systemic undercollateralization can accumulate unnoticed, putting the protocol at financial risk.
3. The liquidator may repay more than the collateral is worth, receiving less value than expected.
4. The last suppliers to call `redeem` will fail to redeem his assets as the contract is in debt causing suppliers who withdraw early to be at an advantage over supplier who withdraw late.

Once suppliers notice that the protocol is in debts, it could lead to redeem race condition where the last suppliers will be unable to redeam part or all of their asset.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Intoduce Bad Debt Accounting
If a borrower still has unpaid debt after full collateral seizure, store this in a badDebt mapping:

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public badDebt;
```

The protocol can then clear this debt from a reserve.
