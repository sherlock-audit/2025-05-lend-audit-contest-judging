# User will clear same-chain debt by repaying only cross-chain debt

### Summary

Incorrect borrow amount calculation in cross-chain repayments will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as a borrower will repay only their small cross-chain debt to clear their large same-chain debt

### Root Cause

When the user repays a cross-chain debt by calling `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` in one chain, a LayerZero message `DestRepay` is sent to the destination chain with the amount to repay. This invokes `CrossChainRouter::_handleDestRepayMessage()` in the destination chain.

In case of a full repayment, and if that was the only cross-chain borrow, the function will call `lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset()` which will remove the asset from the list, clearing the same-chain debt token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **User borrows 1000 tokens on chain A** by calling `CoreRouter::borrow()` with `_amount = 1000` and `_token = USDC`
2. **User initiates cross-chain borrow of 100 tokens** on chain A from collateral on chain B through the cross-chain router
3. **User repays the cross-chain debt fully** by calling repay through the cross-chain liquidation mechanism with `_amount = 100`
4. **A call to _handleDestRepayMessage() is made** in the chain A
5. **The system incorrectly removes the USDC token from the list of debt tokens on chain A** so now the user has no debt in chain A

### Impact

The protocol suffers a direct loss equal to the same-chain borrowed amount that gets incorrectly cleared. The attacker gains the unpaid debt amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The function should not call `lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset()`
