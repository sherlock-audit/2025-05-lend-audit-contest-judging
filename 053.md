# Cross-chain requests exhaust protocol balance due to different gas price on different chains and lead to DOS

### Summary

The protocol pays the cross-chain messaging fee by its own balance, which gives the chance to attackers from the side chain where transaction fee is cheap. The balance of the protocol could be exhausted very quickly and leads to  DOS for cross chain services.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L804-L821

In the `send()` function the protocol pays the messaging fee by its own balance. Attackers could request `crossChainBorrowing()` for a very big amount which will never success again and again.

For example, the attacker requests from Monad chain to Ethereum. The end points should send message to contract deployed on Ethereum which costs a great transaction fee, while the attacker only pays for transaction fees on Monad chain which could be hundred times cheaper than the transaction fee on Ethereum.

Attackers could use this as a lever to exhaust the balance of the protocol and the cross chain services are thus denied.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

Transaction fee on side chain is much cheaper than on Ethereum.

### Attack Path

1.Attackers call `crossChainBorrowing()` from Monad or other side chains to Ethereum.
2.Repeat step1 until the balance of protocol is 0.

### Impact

The protocol's balance will be exhausted easily and leads to DOS for cross-chain services.
