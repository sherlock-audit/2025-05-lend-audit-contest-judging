# `CoreRouter.sol` allows new borrowers to borrow way more than their collateral should allow them to

### Summary

When a user borrows a token for the first time, the [`CoreRouter.borrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145-L190) function fails to properly check if the user's total collateral can cover their actual total future debt which includes this new borrow. Instead, because of the flaw in the logic, the function leads to the collateral being checked against a debt value of zero. This flaw can cause a complete loss of lendable funds for lenders in that market, as any user or adversary can then borrow assets without the system ensuring they have sufficient collateral to back the loan.

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:145`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145-L190), within the `borrow` function:

1. The function correctly calls `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` to determine `collateral` (the total USD value of all the user's collateral) and `borrowed` (the crucial total USD value of all the user's debt including the new amount being requested).

2. However, for the subsequent safety check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");`, the `borrowAmount` variable is derived separately.

3. If `lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken).borrowIndex` is `0` (which happens if the user has never borrowed that specific `_lToken` before), the logic `uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) : 0;` sets this `borrowAmount` to `0`.

4. Consequently, the safety check effectively becomes `require(collateral >= 0)`. This fails to use the correctly calculated `borrowed` value (from step 1, representing the true total debt) and thus does not ensure the user's collateral is sufficient to cover their actual total debt obligations, including the new loan.

Worth noting that this issue can also be possible if a borrower has been fully liquidated, as the `liquidateSeizeUpdate()` function does not include this block: 

` if (newInvestment == 0) {
            lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        }`


But deletes the `borrowIndex` record from the user's state in the full liquidation. The user will still have "supplied" that collateral even though `0` at this point, which will be enough to be able to borrow with no actually collateral as this `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");`  will pass due to the logical flaw. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An adversary (or any user) has not previously borrowed the specific `_lToken` they are targeting. This means their stored `borrowBalance.borrowIndex` for that `_lToken` in `LendStorage` is `0`.
2. The targeted `_lToken` market has available liquidity that the attacker can attempt to borrow.


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Vulnerability Path

1. The adversary or any user identifies an `_lToken` market on LEND that has funds available and which they haven't borrowed from before.
2. They then call the `CoreRouter.borrow()` function. They request a large `_amount` of the `_token` (the underlying asset of the chosen `_lToken`), potentially up to the total liquidity of that market.
3. Inside the `CoreRouter.borrow()` function: 
- The system first calls `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. This correctly calculates `collateral` (the user's total collateral in USD, if any) and `borrowed` (the user's total debt in USD including the new `_amount` they're trying to borrow). 
- Then, `lendStorage.getBorrowBalance()` is called. Since it's the user's first time borrowing this `_lToken`, the returned `borrowIndex` is `0`. 
- The `borrowAmount` variable (which will be used in the safety check) is then calculated. Because `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is `0`, `borrowAmount` is set to `0`. 
- The critical collateral check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");` is performed. With `borrowAmount` being `0`, this check becomes `require(collateral >= 0);`. This will pass as long as the collateral value is not negative, regardless of whether the `collateral` is sufficient to cover the actual `borrowed` value (which represents the true total debt).
4. Since the check passes, the protocol proceeds to borrow the `_amount` on behalf of the user from the target `lToken` contract.
5. The underlying tokens (the `_amount` requested) are then transferred to the user.
6. The caller now possesses these tokens without having had their collateral properly checked against this new debt, potentially having posted insufficient or no collateral for this loan.

### Impact

Lenders who have supplied liquidity to the affected `_lToken` market can suffer a loss of up to 100% of the available funds in that market. The caller gains the borrowed tokens without the protocol ensuring they are sufficiently collateralized for that specific loan.

### Mitigation

The collateral check logic in the `CoreRouter.borrow()` function needs to be corrected.
After obtaining the `collateral` (total USD value of user's collateral) and `borrowed` (total USD value of user's debt including the new borrow request) from `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`, the check should directly compare these two values.

```diff
-        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
-            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
-            : 0;
-
-        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
+        // Ensure the user's total collateral (USD value) is greater than or equal to
+        // their total debt (USD value), including the new borrow request.
+        // The 'borrowed' variable already contains the total future debt in USD.
+        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

This ensures that a user's total collateral value is always checked against their total debt value (including the new loan) for every borrow operation, regardless of their prior borrowing history with a specific asset.
