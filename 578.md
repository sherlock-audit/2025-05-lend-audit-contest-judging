# Cross-chain liquidations will be blocked due to incorrect maxLiquidatable amount calculation.

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidations, the `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function verifies that `repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount`. However, the computed `maxLiquidationAmount` from the `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` function is incorrect if we want to calculate cross-chain collaterals.

```solidity
function getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(address borrower, address lToken, bool isSameChain)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256)
{
    uint256 currentBorrow = 0;

    currentBorrow += isSameChain
        ? borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)
        : borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken);

    uint256 closeFactorMantissa = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa();
    uint256 maxRepay = (currentBorrow * closeFactorMantissa) / 1e18;

    return maxRepay;
}
```

The issue lies in the use of `borrowWithInterest()`, which returns the sum of cross-chain borrows *originating from* the current chain. It **does not** include borrow amounts where the current chain is the **destination chain**.

As a result, if a user has a cross-chain borrow ( originated from another chain), it will not be considered in the liquidation cap calculation. Consequently, valid cross-chain liquidations can be incorrectly rejected.

### Root Cause

The `borrowWithInterest()` function only returns borrows initiated from the current chain, not borrows whose destination chain is current chain (cross-chain collaterals)

Using it to calculate liquidation cap of cross-chain borrows on destination chain leads wrong `maxLiquidationAmount` reverting valid liquidations.

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. User has cross-chain collateral on this chain.
2. No (or less)  cross-chain borrows of that token initiated from this chain.

### External Pre-conditions


### Attack Path

1. Alice has a $1,000 borrow position on Chain B (destination chain), which originated from Chain A.
2. The borrow is undercollateralized and should be liquidated.
3. A liquidator tries to initiate cross-chain liquidation for $500 of Aliceâ€™s borrow on Chain B.
4. Since Alice has no borrows of that token initiated from Chain B, both `borrowWithInterest()` returns 0.
5. As a result, `maxLiquidationAmount` is calculated as 0.
6. The liquidation fails due to this incorrect cap check:

```solidity
require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");
```

### Impact

Valid cross-chain liquidations will be blocked 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a new function that accurately aggregates all cross-chain collaterals of a given token for a user whose destination chain is current chain. Use this function instead of `borrowWithInterest()` when calculating `maxLiquidationAmount` during cross-chain liquidations.
