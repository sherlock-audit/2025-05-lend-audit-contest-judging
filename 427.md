# Incorrect Condition in `borrowWithInterest` Leads to Fund Loss

## Summary
The [borrowWithInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478) function in `LendStorage.sol` incorrectly filters cross-chain borrows in the `crossChainCollaterals` mapping using the condition `if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)`. This condition only includes borrows where both the source and destination chains match the current chain, which contradicts the cross-chain lending design. As a result, legitimate cross-chain borrows are excluded from borrow calculations, potentially allowing users to over-borrow or over-withdraw collateral, leading to direct fund loss.

## Root Cause
In `LendStorage.sol`, the `borrowWithInterest` function processes `crossChainCollaterals` with the condition `if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)`. This is incorrect because cross-chain borrows in `crossChainCollaterals` have `srcEid` as the chain where collateral resides (different from the current chain) and `destEid` as the current chain (where the borrow occurs). The condition excludes valid cross-chain borrows, causing underreporting of borrow amounts.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports cross-chain lending with multiple chains and a common underlying token (e.g., USDC).
2. The `LendStorage` contract tracks cross-chain borrows in `crossChainCollaterals` on the destination chain (where the borrow occurs).
3. The `borrowWithInterest` function is called by critical functions like `getMaxBorrowAmount`, `getMaxRepayAmount`, `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`, and `getMaxWithdrawable`.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A user deposits collateral (e.g., USDC) on one chain (e.g., Chain A) and borrows on another (e.g., Chain B).
2. The price oracle (`UniswapAnchoredViewInterface`) and LayerZero messaging (`CrossChainRouter.sol`) function correctly to facilitate cross-chain operations.

## Attack Path
This issue can be exploited by users to over-borrow or over-withdraw collateral due to underreported borrow amounts. The steps below outline how the vulnerability manifests:

1. **User Deposits Collateral**:
   - On Chain A, the user deposits 1000 USDC.

2. **Cross-Chain Borrow**:
   - The user calls `borrowCrossChain` on Chain A to borrow 500 USDC on Chain B.
   - On Chain B, `CrossChainRouter._handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` records the borrow in `crossChainCollaterals[user][USDC]` with `srcEid = ChainA`, `destEid = ChainB`.

3. **Incorrect Borrow Calculation**:
   - On Chain B, `borrowWithInterest` is called (e.g., via `getMaxBorrowAmount` or `getMaxWithdrawable`).
   - The condition `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` evaluates to false because `srcEid` (Chain A) ≠ `currentEid` (Chain B).
   - The 500 USDC is excluded from the borrow total, underreporting the user’s borrow amount.

4. **Exploitation**:
   - The user can borrow more USDC on Chain B (e.g., via `getMaxBorrowAmount`), as the 500 USDC borrow is not counted, violating the collateral ratio.
   - Alternatively, the user can withdraw excess collateral on Chain A (via `getMaxWithdrawable`), as the borrow is not accounted for, leaving the protocol undercollateralized.

5. **Fund Loss**:
   - The protocol loses funds if the user defaults on the over-borrowed amount or withdraws collateral, as the borrow exceeds the collateral’s value.

## Impact
- **Direct Fund Loss**: Underreporting borrows allows users to over-borrow or over-withdraw, violating the collateral-to-debt ratio. This can lead to direct loss of funds for the protocol (>1% and >$10) if users default, as the collateral may be insufficient to cover losses.
- **Protocol Integrity**: The issue undermines the lending protocol’s core functionality by failing to enforce proper borrowing limits, exposing the protocol to insolvency risks.
- **Sherlock Criteria** (Section IV): High severity applies due to direct loss of funds without extensive external conditions. The issue requires only a standard cross-chain borrow, a common use case. Per Section V, Medium severity could apply for breaking core functionality, but the potential for significant fund loss elevates it to High.

**Reasoning for High Severity**:
- **Direct Loss**: Over-borrowing or over-withdrawing can lead to protocol losses if users default, meeting the High severity threshold (>1% and >$10).
- **Minimal Conditions**: The issue occurs with standard cross-chain borrowing, not requiring complex external states, aligning with High severity.
- **Core Functionality**: Violating the collateral ratio breaks the protocol’s lending invariant, a critical feature.

## Mitigation
Correct the condition in `borrowWithInterest` to include all cross-chain borrows where the destination chain is the current chain. Modify the function as follows:
```solidity
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
    Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

    require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
        if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
            borrowedAmount += (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
        }
    }
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
        if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid) {
            borrowedAmount += (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
        }
    }
    return borrowedAmount;
}
```
This ensures all cross-chain borrows on the current chain are included, preventing underreporting and maintaining the collateral-to-debt ratio. Additionally, address the invariant violation (previous report) to fully support complex cross-chain scenarios.
