# An attacker can use cross chain borrowing to drain another chain

### Summary

The cross chain borrow action is aimed at ensuring that a borrower has enough collateral locked on the remote chain to cover for the loan they are about to take on the other chain. However the implementation here is not effective enough, as a malicious user can simply withdraw their collaterals on the remote chain after receiving the loan on the other chain.

```solidity
    function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
        require(msg.sender != address(0), "Invalid sender");
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");
        require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");

        // Get source lToken for collateral
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_borrowToken);
        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported source token");

        // Get the destination chain's version of the token
        address destLToken = lendStorage.underlyingToDestlToken(_borrowToken, _destEid);
        require(destLToken != address(0), "Unsupported destination token");

        // Accrue interest on source token (collateral token) on source chain
        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        // Add collateral tracking on source chain
        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

        if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)) {
            enterMarkets(_lToken);
        }

        // Get current collateral amount for the LayerZero message
        // This will be used on dest chain to check if sufficient
        (, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

        // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
        // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
            collateral,
            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
    }
```

No special state update is made here to store how much loan the user is taking on the other chain. A layerzero messgae is simply sent to the chain indicating that they have `collateral` amount stored on the remote chain. After successfuly receiving the tokens on the other chain, the user can take back their tokens by calling `CoreRouter::redeem`

The layerzero messgae triggers the function below, which simply transfers the tokens to the address of the user

```solidity
    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        // Accrue interest on borrowed token on destination chain
        LTokenInterface(payload.destlToken).accrueInterest();
        ........
@>>     CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, destUnderlying);
        ......
```

### Root Cause

Lack of Borrow balance update in `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` 

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

* User calls `CoreRouter::supply`, with huge supply amount
* User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` with equivalent borrow amount
* User withdraws back their collateral on the remote chain, while they receive the tokens on the other chain

### Impact

Loss of funds, Protocol could be drained on all chains

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Similar to how it is done in `CoreRouter::borrow`, call `lendstorgae::updateBorrowBalance` before sending the layerzero message to ensure that the user's borrow balance is correctly updated and will effectively prevent the user from perfroming withdrawals
