# No Minimum Supply Amount Check

## Description

The supply() function does not enforce a minimum threshold on the _amount parameter. This means users can call the function with very small values (e.g., 1 wei), leading to unnecessary storage updates, reward distribution calculations, and gas consumption.

## Impact

Medium
	•	Encourages spamming or griefing attacks on low-cost chains like L2s (Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.).
	•	Leads to unnecessary state changes, increased gas usage for other users (due to more entries in storage mappings).
	•	Potentially increases gas costs during reward distribution or snapshot reads (due to increased storage bloat).

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
see vulnerable code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L66

```solidity
// Spammer repeatedly supplies 1 wei
for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    coreRouter.supply(1, USDC); // 6 decimals
}
// This bloats totalInvestment, reward distribution, userAsset list
```

## Mitigation
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_SUPPLY_AMOUNT = 1e6; // Example: 1 USDC with 6 decimals

require(_amount >= MIN_SUPPLY_AMOUNT, "Below minimum supply amount");
```
