# Double interest accrual in `borrow` function

## Summary
The double accrual of interest in the `borrow` function due to applying `borrowIndex` after `accrueInterest` and `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` will cause an inability to borrow or increased collateral requirements for users as the calculated `borrowAmount` is artificially inflated.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol` within the `borrow` function, the `borrowAmount` is calculated by multiplying the `borrowed` value (returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which already includes interest from `accrueInterest`) by the current `borrowIndex` and dividing by the user’s stored `borrowIndex`, resulting in double-counting of interest.

```solidity
File: src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol
  145:     function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
  146:         require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");
  147: 
  148:         address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);
  149: 
  150:         LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
  151: 
  152:         (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = //audit: with interest
  153:             lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
  154: 
  155:         LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);
  156: 
  157:         uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 
  158:             ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) //audit: with interest
  159:             : 0;

[CoreRouter.borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145-L145)

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The lToken pool needs to have a non-zero `borrowIndex`, indicating existing borrows with accrued interest.
2. The lToken pool needs to have no interactions (e.g., `borrow`, `repay`) for several hours to accumulate significant interest (e.g., at least 10% APY).
3. The user needs to have an existing borrow on the lToken (i.e., `currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0`).
4. The user needs to have a significant collateral value (e.g., equivalent to $10,000 or more) to make the inflated collateral requirement impactful.


## Attack Path
1. A user with an existing borrow (e.g., 1000 USDC, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` = 1.0) calls `borrow` on the CoreRouter to borrow additional tokens (e.g., 500 USDC).
2. The Router invokes `accrueInterest` on the lToken, updating `borrowIndex` (e.g., to 1.01 after 1% interest accrual).
3. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` returns `borrowed` = 1010 USDC (1000 * 1.01, including interest) plus the new borrow amount (500 USDC), totaling 1510 USDC.
4. The Router calculates `borrowAmount` = (1510 * 1.01) / 1.0 ≈ 1525.1 USDC, double-counting interest on the existing borrow.
5. The Router checks `collateral >= borrowAmount`, requiring collateral for 1525.1 USDC instead of 1510 USDC.
6. The user’s transaction reverts if collateral is insufficient, or they are forced to lock more collateral than necessary.

## Impact
The user suffers an inability to borrow or must provide excess collateral (e.g., $15.1 more for a $1510 borrow at 1% interest), breaking core borrowing functionality. The opportunity cost of locked collateral or missed borrowing opportunities exceeds 0.01% and $10 for users with significant principal (e.g., $10,000).

The error will be especially visible if the user has borrowed only one type of token.

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy an lToken pool (e.g., cUSDC) with a borrow rate of 10% APY and an existing user borrow of 1000 USDC (`currentBorrow.borrowIndex` = 1.0).
- Allow the pool to remain inactive for 12 hours, accruing 0.137% interest (10% / 365 / 2), updating `borrowIndex` to 1.00137.
- The user calls `borrow` for an additional 500 USDC.
- `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` returns `borrowed` = 1001.37 USDC (1000 * 1.00137) + 500 = 1501.37 USDC.
- `borrowAmount` is calculated as (1501.37 * 1.00137) / 1.0 ≈ 1503.76 USDC, inflating the requirement by 2.39 USDC.
- The user needs collateral for 1503.76 USDC instead of 1501.37 USDC, potentially causing a revert if collateral is just sufficient, or locking excess collateral worth $2.39.
- For a $10,000 principal, a 0.137% inflation (double-counted interest) results in a $13.70 opportunity cost, meeting medium severity.

## Mitigation
Remove the redundant interest calculation in `borrowAmount` by using the `borrowed` value directly from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, as it already includes accrued interest. Example:
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = borrowed; // Use directly, no additional borrowIndex adjustment
require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
