###Title: DAIInterestRateModelV3::dsrPerBlock() can underflow and revert if pot.dsr() is below 1e27

Description

The dsrPerBlock() function converts Maker’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR) from RAY (1e27 scale) to BASE (1e18 scale). It does this by subtracting 1e27 from pot.dsr(), then scaling the result.

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function dsrPerBlock() public view returns (uint256) {
    return (pot.dsr() - RAY_BASE) / RAY_TO_BASE_SCALE * SECONDS_PER_BLOCK;
}
```

This subtraction assumes that pot.dsr() is always greater than or equal to 1e27. But that’s not guaranteed. If the Maker Pot contract is paused, or drip() hasn’t been called yet, pot.dsr() may return less than 1e27, causing this line to underflow and revert.


Impact

This will cause a revert any time dsrPerBlock() is called while DSR is below 1e27.

Because poke() depends on this function:
```solidity
function poke() public {
    ...
    baseRatePerBlock = dsrPerBlock() * BASE / assumedOneMinusReserveFactorMantissa;
    ...
}
```

This means any call to poke() would fail, freezing interest rate updates for the DAI market.

The issue doesn’t directly steal funds, but it disables core logic, and users could be left with outdated or incorrect rates for long periods.



Proof of Concept

If Maker's Pot is in a paused state, or drip() hasn’t been called, DSR can be stale or below 1e27.
// returns something like 999999999999999999999999999
uint256 dsr = pot.dsr();
This makes:
pot.dsr() - RAY_BASE  // underflows

Recommended Mitigation

Add a  check before subtraction:
```solidity
uint256 dsr = pot.dsr();
if (dsr < RAY_BASE) return 0;
return (dsr - RAY_BASE) / RAY_TO_BASE_SCALE * SECONDS_PER_BLOCK;
```

This avoids reverts and returns a safe fallback value.
