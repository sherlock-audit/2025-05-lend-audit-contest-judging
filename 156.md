# User may receive more LTokens due to stale exchange rate

### Summary

The `supply()` function in CoreRouter fetches the exchange rate before calling the underlying LToken's mint operation, which internally calls `accrueInterest()` and updates the exchange rate, leading to inflated accounting of minted lTokens in CoreRouter's records.

### Root Cause

In the [`supply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80) function, the exchange rate is fetched too early, before the actual minting occurs:

```solidity
// Get exchange rate before mint
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Mint lTokens
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

// Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

// Update total investment using calculated mintTokens
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
);
```

However, the `LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint()` call internally executes `mintInternal()`, which calls `accrueInterest()` before processing the mint. This `accrueInterest()` call updates the exchange rate to reflect newly accrued interest, making the previously fetched `exchangeRateBefore` stale. That results in CoreRouter recording more lTokens in `totalInvestment` than were actually minted by the LToken contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Time has passed since the last interest accrual for the lToken
2. The market has accrued interest that would increase the exchange rate
3. User calls the supply function

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Wait for a period where significant interest has accrued but hasn't been applied to the lToken yet
2. Call `supply()` function when the stored exchange rate is stale
3. CoreRouter calculates minted tokens using the old, lower exchange rate
4. LToken's `mint()` call accrues interest and uses the updated, higher exchange rate internally
5. CoreRouter records more lTokens in `totalInvestment` than were actually minted
6. User can later attempt to redeem these inflated lToken amounts, potentially causing protocol issues

### Impact

Systematic inflation of user lToken balances in CoreRouter's accounting system. Users appear to own more lTokens than actually exist, creating a discrepancy between `totalInvestment` records and actual LToken balances. This can lead to failed redemptions when users try to withdraw their inflated balances, potential over-collateralization calculations, and protocol insolvency as the accounting mismatch compounds over time.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Accrue interest explicitly before fetching the exchange rate to ensure calculations use the current exchange rate:

```solidity
// Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

_approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);

// Accrue interest first to get current exchange rate
LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

// Get current exchange rate after accrual
uint256 exchangeRateCurrent = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Mint lTokens
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

// Calculate actual minted tokens using current exchange rate
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateCurrent;

// Update total investment using correctly calculated mintTokens
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
);
```

This ensures the exchange rate used for CoreRouter's accounting matches the one used internally by the LToken during minting.
