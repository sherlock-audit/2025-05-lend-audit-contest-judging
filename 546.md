# Missing Borrow Position Updates During Liquidation

## Summary
The CrossChainRouter contract defines a `_updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation` function to update the borrower's debt position after liquidation, but this function is never called during the liquidation process, resulting in borrowers' debt positions not being properly updated.

## Root Cause
In `CrossChainRouter.sol:286-305` the [_updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-Sparrow-23/blob/471749b3043a3eca36d78e6d1b3a77aef72a536e/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L287-L307) function exists but is never called from any of the liquidation handlers:

```solidity
function _updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation(
    LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params,
    uint256 currentBorrowIndex
) private {
    LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(msg.sender, params.borrowedAsset);
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < userBorrows.length;) {
        if (userBorrows[i].srcEid == params.srcEid) {
            // Reduce the borrow amount
            uint256 borrowAmount = (userBorrows[i].principle * currentBorrowIndex) / userBorrows[i].borrowIndex;
            userBorrows[i].principle = borrowAmount - params.repayAmount;
            userBorrows[i].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(msg.sender, params.borrowedAsset, i, userBorrows[i]);
            break;
        }
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, the function incorrectly uses `msg.sender` instead of `params.borrower` when accessing the borrower's positions, which would update the wrong user's debt even if called.

## Internal pre-conditions
1. A user must have a cross-chain borrow position (collateral on Chain A, debt on Chain B)
2. A liquidator must execute a cross-chain liquidation

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User supplies collateral on Chain A and borrows on Chain B
2. User's position becomes eligible for liquidation (health factor < 1)
3. Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain on Chain B
4. The liquidation executes successfully, seizing collateral on Chain A
5. The _updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation function is never called
6. The borrower's debt position remains unchanged despite the liquidation
7. This creates an accounting mismatch in the protocol

## Impact
The impact of this bug is severe:

1. Borrowers' debt positions remain unchanged after liquidation
2. This creates a critical accounting mismatch in the protocol
3. The protocol's solvency is at risk as debt records become inaccurate
4. Borrowers may be liquidated multiple times for the same debt
5. Protocol funds may be drained through multiple liquidations of the same position

## Mitigation
1. Call the _updateBorrowPositionForLiquidation function at the appropriate point in the liquidation flow
2. Fix the `msg.sender` reference to use `params.borrower` instead
