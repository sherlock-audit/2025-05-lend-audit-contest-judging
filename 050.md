# Incorrect Exchange Rate Usage in Supply and Redeem Operations

### Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract uses outdated exchange rates when calculating minted and redeemed tokens, leading to potential loss of assets for suppliers. The issue occurs because the contract uses the exchange rate before minting/redeeming operations, while the actual operations operate on updated the exchange rate.


### Root Cause

The issue stems from using exchange rates before they are updated by the mint/redeem operations:

In supply operation:
```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Mint lTokens
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

// Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

In redeem operation:
```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Calculate expected underlying tokens
uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

// Perform redeem
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

// Transfer underlying tokens to the user
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User has sufficient lTokens to redeem
- Exchange rate changes between operations


### External Pre-conditions

 some Interest has  accrued


### Attack Path

1. User A supplies collateral using outdated exchange rate and borrow assets
2. Exchange rate updates due to interest accrual
3. User B supplies and redeems their tokens
4. User A  repay borrow and attempts to redeem their tokens
5. User A receives fewer tokens than expected due to incorrect exchange rate calculation


### Impact

Loss of assets for suppliers due to incorrect exchange rate calculations.Systematic underpayment to suppliers when redeeming their collateral.Chains with faster block times (e.g., 2 seconds) experience more frequent exchange rate updates so the impact on such chains will be very high.


### PoC

```solidity
// Add this function 
    function _supply(uint256 amount , address user) internal returns (address token, address lToken) {
        token = supportedTokens[0];
        lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

        ERC20Mock(token).mint(user, amount);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);
        coreRouter.supply(amount, token);
    }
// Add this test case
function test_outdated_usage_of_exchangeRate_issue() public {
    // Bound array length to a reasonable size
    uint256 collateralAmount = 10e18;
    address borrower = makeAddr("borrower");
    address borrower1 = makeAddr("borrower1");
    address token = supportedTokens[0];

    address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

    uint256 exchangeRate = LTokenInterface(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
    uint256 expectedTokens = (collateralAmount * 1e18) / exchangeRate;

    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    // Supply collateral
    _supply(collateralAmount, borrower);
    vm.stopPrank();
    assertEq(
        LTokenInterface(lToken).balanceOf(address(coreRouter)),
        expectedTokens,
        "Router should have received correct amount of lTokens First deposit"
    );
    uint256 borrowAmount = 7e18;
    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    // Get initial balance
    uint256 initialTokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(borrower);
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit BorrowSuccess(borrower, lToken, borrowAmount);
    coreRouter.borrow(borrowAmount, token);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Verify balances after borrowing
    assertEq(
        IERC20(token).balanceOf(borrower) - initialTokenBalance,
        borrowAmount,
        "Should receive correct amount of borrowed tokens"
    );

    // Verify final borrow balance
    assertEq(
        lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken), borrowAmount, "Total borrowed amount should match"
    );        
    vm.roll(100);
    uint256 exchangeRate1 = LTokenInterface(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
    uint256 expectedTokens1 = (collateralAmount * 1e18) / exchangeRate1;

    vm.startPrank(borrower1);
    // Supply collateral
    (token, ) = _supply(collateralAmount, borrower1);
    coreRouter.redeem(expectedTokens1, payable(lToken));
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    borrowAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken);
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(borrower, borrowAmount); // mint extra token, that borrower can pay all his borrower amount + interest 
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), borrowAmount);
    coreRouter.repayBorrow(borrowAmount, lToken); // @audit: repay complete borrow
    vm.expectRevert(); // will revert on Error.INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY
    coreRouter.redeem(expectedTokens, payable(lToken)); // @audit: here the borrower will not be able to redeem all of his collateral, due to bug in the code
    vm.stopPrank();
    // @audit: the router must have lToken balance of borrower, but it does not have, So the next check will fail
    assertEq(
        LTokenInterface(lToken).balanceOf(address(coreRouter)),
        expectedTokens,
        "Router should have received correct amount of lTokens"
    );
}
```
Add the above test case to `test/TestBorrowing.t.sol` and run with command `forge test --mt test_outdated_usage_of_exchangeRate_issue -vvvv`

### Mitigation

1. Use exchange rates after mint/redeem operations:
```solidity
// For supply
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 exchangeRateAfter = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateAfter;

// For redeem
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
uint256 exchangeRateAfter = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateAfter) / 1e18;
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
