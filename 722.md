# Wrong Calculation of cross chain borrow value by `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()`.

### Summary

To calculate the amount to be borrowed with interest on different chain, `borrowWithInterest()` function is called 

The process:

User initiates after supply -> borrowCrossChain() -> getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() -> borrowWithInterest()

the last function `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()` will give wrong `borrowedAmount` value as it is one of the condition will fail to hold true


### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497

While calculating for cross chain colleteral in `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()` function there is additional condition which prevents the code block from executating as the condition `destId == srcId` will never hold true.
 
Therefore bypassing the code block which is not intended and returning default borrowedAmount value which in this case will be zero.

```js
 function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        ...
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.

                // @audit collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid this condition is not needed
            @>  if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
        return borrowedAmount;
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user had to supply tokens to protocol 
- The user should peform cross chain borrow first

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

- The user will not be able to borrow from different chain even after supplying token to source chain.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```bash 
- if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
+ if (collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) 
```
