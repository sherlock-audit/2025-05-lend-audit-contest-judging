### Attack Path

Assume that Bob supplied collateral in Chain A, and perform a cross-chain borrowing in Chain B. The value of Bob's supplied collateral drops significantly, and his account is subjected to liquidation.

In order to liquidate Bob's account, the liquidator has to call Chain B's `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain` function to liquidate Bob's borrowing position. Also, since this is a cross-chain borrowing position on Chain B, only Chain B's `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain` should be used to perform the liquidation.

When Chain B's `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain` is executed, it will send a `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` LayerZero (LZ) message from Chain B to Chain A, so that Bob's account state in Chain A can be updated accordingly, and Bob's account in Chain A can be liquidated and have its collateral released to the liquidator.

When the `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` LZ message arrived in Chain A's `CrossChainRouter`, the following `_handleLiquidationExecute` function below will be executed to handle and continue with the liquidation. At the end of the `_handleLiquidationExecute` function, it will call `_send` at Line 335 below to send a `ContractType.LiquidationSuccess` LZ message from Chain A to Chain B to let Chain B's router know of the liquidation status.

However, the issue is that a malicious user can intentionally cause the sending of LZ messages via `_send` to fail to block or DOS the liquidation of their account. Just before the `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` is delivered to Chain A's `CrossChainRouter`, the malicious user can front-run its transaction and perform unnecessary cross-chain operations on the router to use up or spend all the ETH residing in the `CrossChainRouter` that is intended for LZ cross-chain messaging. 

When the `_send` in the `_handleLiquidationExecute` function is executed, it will revert due to insufficient fee/ETH needed for the cross-chain message. Note that calling `_send` involves sending a LayerZero cross-chain message that requires fee, and if there is no fee provided or insufficient fee provided, it will revert or fail.

In this case, liquidation attempts against Bob's account can be blocked, and the bad debt will accumulate and remain in the protocol, resulting in a loss of assets for the protocol. Furthermore, a delay in liquidation will also lead to a loss or more bad debt because unhealthy accounts have to be liquidated quickly, as the value of the collateral might be dropping rapidly.

### Impact

Liquidation can be DOS or blocked, leading to bad debt to accumulate and remain in the protocol, resulting in a loss of assets for the protocol.
