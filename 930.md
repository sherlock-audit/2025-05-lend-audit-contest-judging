# The liquidation validation logic is wrong

### Summary

On Chain A (the collateral chain), the [liquidation check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431-L436) treats `payload.amount` as if it were an additional borrow amount, but `payload.amount` is the number of collateral tokens to seize.

### Root Cause

On Chain B, during a cross‐chain liquidation, `_executeLiquidationCore` calculates how many collateral tokens to seize:

```solidity
(uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
    .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, params.lTokenToSeize, params.repayAmount);
```

Then sends `seizeTokens` (`payload.amount`) to Chain A:

```solidity
_send(
    params.srcEid,
    seizeTokens, // this becomes payload.amount
    params.storedBorrowIndex,
    0,
    params.borrower,
    lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid),
    msg.sender,
    params.borrowedAsset,
    ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
);
```

The `payload.amount` represents the seize amount (collateral to take), not the borrow amount. But it is being passed as the `borrowAmount` parameter on Chain A:

```solidity
function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
>       payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );
    return borrowed > collateral;
}
```

```solidity
function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    address account,
    LToken lTokenModify,
    uint256 redeemTokens,
    uint256 borrowAmount
)
```

In other words, it asks “If this user were to borrow `payload.amount` more, would they be undercollateralized?” But `payload.amount` is not a proposed additional borrow, it is the number of tokens that will be seized. That means a healthy position could be marked liquidatable just because “borrowing that many more” would tip them over the edge, even if no actual borrow ever happens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Healthy positions can be mistakenly flagged as liquidatable, allowing valid accounts to be liquidated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix `_checkLiquidationValid` to use the correct parameters:

```diff
    function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
-           payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
+           payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, 0
        );
        return borrowed > collateral;
    }
```
