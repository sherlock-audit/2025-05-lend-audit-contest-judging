# Small positions don't offer enough incentives for liquidators

### Summary

Small positions may never be liquidated because the liquidator's profit can be less than the gas and operating costs, especially on mainnet with high fees. This leads to unliquidated debt accumulating in the protocol.

### Root Cause

The contraction does not have any minimum amount set. Nither in `supply` function to deposit collateral or earn lend tokens and nor in `borrow` function to borrow some amount.

### Attack Path

If there is no profit to be made than there will be no one to call the liquidate function. Consider the following example:
- Collateral Factor = 0.75
-  User A deposits collateral worth `$75`, and mint 50 USDC tokens equal to `$50`. The collateral ratio is 75/50 = 150%.
- The price of the provided collateral drops, and now user A collateral is worth `$70`, `70/50 = 140%` collateral ratio. The position should be liquidated now, so the protocol doesn't become insolvent.
- However, as the liquidation reward (say 5% of the collateral) e.g., the liquidator gets $55 worth of collateral for burning $50 â€” the profit margin might only be $5.
- And as contract will be deployed on Ethereum, On Ethereum mainnet, where gas fees are high, this slim profit may not cover transaction costs. As a result, no liquidator will act, leaving the unhealthy position unresolved.



### Impact

Positions that are small in size, don't offer enough rewards to the liquidator and hence will never be liquidated, accruing debt on the protocol.

### Mitigation

Restrict users having small collateral positions.
