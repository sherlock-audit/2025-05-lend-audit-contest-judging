# Missing Fee Estimation and Improper Excess Refund Handling in Cross-Chain Borrow Flow

### Summary
The [`CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) function enables users to initiate a cross-chain borrow by sending ETH to cover the LayerZero messaging fee. While the protocol may typically pre-fund the contract to cover these fees, there is no guarantee that the contract balance will remain intact. In scenarios where the balance is depleted—whether through malicious draining or operational issues—users would be required to pay the messaging fee themselves via msg.value.

However, the protocol does not offer a fee estimation mechanism, preventing users from knowing how much ETH to send. If the user underpays, the message may fail or be dropped. If the user overpays, the excess is refunded to the contract's balance and not to the user, users effectively lose access to any overpaid funds.

### Root cause
The protocol lacks a fee estimation function or interface that would allow users to query the required LayerZero messaging fee before calling `borrowCrossChain()`. Furthermore, the [`_send`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) function sends any excess funds to payable `(address(this))`, causing overpaid ETH to accumulate within the contract instead of being refunded to the user.

### Attack Path
- A malicious actor or operational issue drains the contract balance.

- Users attempting to call `borrowCrossChain()` must supply `msg.value` to cover the full messaging fee.

- Without a fee estimate, users risk:

Sending too little and causing message delivery failure.

Sending too much and having excess ETH refunded to the contract balance.

- Overpaid funds accumulate in the protocol and can only be recovered by the contract owner, not the original sender.


### Impact
Overpaying users loss excess funds while underpaying users are at risk of their messages failing.

### Recommendation
Implement a fee estimation function and refund any excess `msg.value` to the sender after deducting the actual messaging fee
