# Lack of Collateral Lock Allows Withdrawal During Cross-Chain Borrow

### Summary

The absence of an explicit collateral lock during cross-chain borrow operations will cause a protocol draining risk for all users as a malicious actor can initiate a cross-chain borrow and immediately withdraw their collateral on the source chain before the cross-chain state is fully synchronized, allowing them to escape with borrowed funds and leaving the protocol under-collateralized.



### Root Cause

In CrossChainRouter, there is no mechanism to lock or reserve a user's collateral on the source chain while a cross-chain borrow is in-flight. The protocol relies solely on liquidity checks, which may not be sufficient due to asynchronous cross-chain messaging and state updates.

```solidity
    function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
       ...

        // Get current collateral amount for the LayerZero message
        // This will be used on dest chain to check if sufficient
        (, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

        // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
        // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
            collateral,
            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
    }
```

On the destination chain collateral check is compared against the initial message amount which an attacker can change on source chain.

```solidity
    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
       ...

        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );

        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. The attacker supplies collateral and initiates a cross-chain borrow.
2. Before the cross-chain message is processed and the borrow is finalized on the destination chain, the attacker withdraws their collateral on the source chain (since there is no lock).
3. Once the cross-chain borrow is completed, the attacker has both the borrowed funds and their original collateral, draining protocol liquidity and leaving other users exposed to loss.

### Impact

The protocol can become under-collateralized

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Lock  the user's collateral on the source chain immediately upon initiating a cross-chain borrow, preventing withdrawal until the cross-chain operation is finalized.
