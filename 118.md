# Incorrect liquidation validation leads to loss of funds for borrowers or protocol insolvency

### Summary

The incorrect usage of collateral seize amount instead of borrowed amount in liquidation validation will cause incorrect liquidation decisions for cross-chain positions as the liquidation validity check compares wrong values, leading to either liquidation of healthy positions or prevention of liquidating underwater positions.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:432` the `_checkLiquidationValid()` function incorrectly uses `payload.amount` (which contains seize tokens denominated in collateral) as the `borrowAmount` parameter when calling `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`, when it should be using the actual borrowed amount being repaid to validate if the position is underwater.

### Attack Path

1. **Liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain()` on Chain B** with `repayAmount` for a borrower's position
2. **`_executeLiquidationCore()` calculates `seizeTokens`** based on `repayAmount` and liquidation incentive
3. **System sends LayerZero message to Chain A** with `seizeTokens` as `payload.amount`
4. **Chain A receives message and calls `_checkLiquidationValid()`** which incorrectly uses `seizeTokens` (collateral amount) instead of the original `repayAmount` (borrowed amount)
5. **`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` performs incorrect calculation** using collateral seize amount as the borrowed amount

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect liquidation decisions that can lead to:
1. **Liquidation of healthy positions**: Borrowers lose collateral unfairly when their positions should not be liquidatable, causing direct loss of funds
2. **Prevention of liquidating underwater positions**: Truly underwater positions cannot be liquidated, leading to bad debt accumulation and potential protocol insolvency

The severity depends on asset price ratios and liquidation incentives, but can result in significant losses for either borrowers (through unfair liquidations) or the protocol (through unpaid bad debt).


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `_checkLiquidationValid()` to use the original repay amount in borrowed token terms rather than the seize amount in collateral terms. The payload should include the repay amount.
