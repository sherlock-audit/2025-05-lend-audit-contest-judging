# Cross‐Chain Borrow Functionality Fails to Enforce Collateral Requirements, Allowing Undercollateralized Withdrawals

### Summary

A vulnerability in the cross‐chain borrowing logic permits a malicious user to borrow assets on a destination chain without ever posting or locking valid collateral. 

### Root Cause



The function [borrowWithInterestSame](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L509) Always Returns 0 for New On‐Chain Borrows
```solidity
function borrowWithInterestSame(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 borrowIndex = borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].borrowIndex;
    uint256 borrowBalanceSameChain = borrowIndex != 0
        ? (borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex())) / borrowIndex
        : 0;
    return borrowBalanceSameChain;
}

```

If the user has never borrowed that token on the current chain, borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].borrowIndex is zero. The function then returns 0.

borrowWithInterest(...) Ignores All Valid Cross‐Chain Entries:
```solidity
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
    Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

    require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated");
    if (borrows.length > 0) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
            if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                borrowedAmount += (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) 
                                   / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
            }
        }
    } else {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
            if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                borrowedAmount += (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex())
                                   / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
            }
        }
    }
    return borrowedAmount;
}

```

In the first loop, the code sums up all cross‐chain borrow entries for which borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid.
But a borrow that originated on Chain A and was sent to Chain B will have srcEid = A, not B. Therefore, this condition never holds.

In the second loop, the code sums up all cross‐chain collateral entries for which collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid.

A collateral that came from Chain A would have srcEid = A and destEid = B. Requiring srcEid == currentEid (i.e. A == B) is impossible. That loop is never entered.

Every valid cross‐chain borrow or collateral entry is skipped. The function always returns 0, even if the user did supply collateral on Chain A or has existing cross‐chain borrows.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.No Existing On‐Chain Borrow Balance
2. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral Does Not Include the New Borrow
The function aggregates only existing debt (both on‐chain and cross‐chain) without adding the requested borrowAmount to sumBorrowed. Consequently, after both loops, sumBorrowed == 0 despite a positive borrowAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.Preparation on Chain A:

Attacker holds zero collateral or chooses to supply zero.

They submit a cross‐chain borrow request indicating they wish to borrow 100 DAI on Chain B. They set payload.collateral = 0.

2.Cross‐Chain Call to Chain B:

Chain B calls _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(...) with payload.amount = 100 DAI and payload.collateral = 0.
Internally, it calls getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(…). Since there are no on‐chain borrows and cross‐chain loops never match, it returns (0, 0).

3.The Collateral Check IS Bypassed:
The code checks require(0 ≥ 0). This condition is true, so the borrow is allowed.

The attacker now receives 100 DAI on Chain B, having posted no collateral. They can immediately convert it to another asset, send it back to Chain A, or sell it on a DEX.

There is no way for the protocol to liquidate or seize collateral because, on record, the attacker appears to have zero debt and zero collateral post‐execution.


### Impact

Because of the two root causes above, the system never enforces any collateral requirement when a user borrows on a fresh destination chain. So attackers can withdraw all of the money from the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


After computing (sumCollateral, sumBorrowed), you can enforce:
```solidity
require(sumCollateral > 0 || borrowAmount == 0, "Must post collateral before borrowing");

```
