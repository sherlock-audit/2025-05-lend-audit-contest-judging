# Attacker can create small positions that will not have any incentive to liquidate

### Summary

Partial repayment allows an attacker to reduce his debt positions or create small debt positions (since collateral >= borrow amount) that will have no incentive to be liquidated which can lead the protocol to accrue bad debt.

### Root Cause

When initially opening a position collateral can be [equal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L161) to borrow amount:

```javascript
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

@>      require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

Or when repaying borrower can use partial repayment to [reduce](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L496-L499) his debt to tiny amounts such as 1 wei, which will not any incentive for liqudators to close them, since liquidator must receive rewards higher than the gas fees, which may not be fraction amounts since there will be a deployment on ETH mainnet also.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower must borrow small amounts such as 1 wei.
2. Or reduce his debt positions to 1 wei.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Such positions will accrue the protocol bad debt, which can lead to insolvency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a minimum borrow amount or don't allow borrowers to leave small amount when repaying on their debt.
