# Incorrect debt account as there is no visibility of all the borrowing positions/debts from all chains

### Attack Path

Assume that there are three (3) supported chains. Chain A, B, and C.

Let's use Chain B as an example. Chain B is only aware of the debt or borrowing amount from the following sources, based on the `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function:

- `borrowWithInterestSame` - Borrowing in the same chain, which is Chain B. Borrowing happens locally in Chain B. Read value from `borrowBalance` mapping.
- `borrowWithInterest` - Cross-chain borrowing/debt on local Chain (Chain B). This will be recorded if other chains (Example Chain A or C) attempt to borrow from Chain B. The collateral will be on other chains (Example Chain A or C), but the borrowing/debt position will be in Chain B.

This protocol is supposed to be an Omni chain or multi-chain lending protocol. Thus, the protocol on each chain is supposed to have visibility of all the borrowing positions/debt in all the chains where the LEND protocol is deployed.

However, the issue is that it is not the case here. As shown above, when calling `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` on Chain B, it does not have visibility of the Cross-Chain borrowing/debt on Chain A and Chain C. 

Thus, when determining the debt of an account, it will not have the whole picture. It will undervalue the user account's debt/borrowing position.

```solidity
File: LendStorage.sol
385:     function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
..SNIP..
420:         // Second loop: Calculate borrow value from borrowed assets
421:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length;) {
422:             LToken asset = LToken(borrowedAssets[i]);
423: 
424:             // Get borrow balance for this asset
425:             uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));
426: 
427:             // Add cross-chain borrows if any
428:             totalBorrow += borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset));
```

### Impact

Undervaluing the account's debt or borrowing position, leading to users being able to borrow more than expected, thus stealing funds and causing a loss for the protocol.
