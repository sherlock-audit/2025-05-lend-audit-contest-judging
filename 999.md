# Attacker will steal collateral and create bad debt for cross-chain borrowers

### Summary

Using collateral‐denominated seizeTokens as the repayment amount in _handleLiquidationSuccess will cause a complete loss of collateral and an un-accounted debt for cross-chain borrowers as an attacker will trigger a “successful” liquidation without paying the borrowed asset, siphoning collateral while the debt remains open.

### Root Cause

- In CrossChainRouter.sol 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443
the function  **_handleLiquidationSuccess** forwards

After \_handleLiquidationSuccess receives the **LiquidationSuccess** message from chain A, it immediately takes

```sol
payload.amount      // = seizeTokens (number of collateral-side lTokens)
payload.destlToken  // = collateral lToken on chain A
```

and passes them to

```solidity
repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
    borrower = payload.sender,
    repayer  = payload.liquidator,
    _amount  = payload.amount,     // collateral quantity
    _lToken  = payload.destlToken, // collateral lToken
    _srcEid  = srcEid
);
```

This call treats **collateral** as though it were the **borrowed asset**, and treats the **collateral quantity** as the **debt to be repaid**.

As a result, the lending-asset and collateral-asset lines—each with its own precision and exchange rate—are completely mixed up.

Here payload.amount is **seizeTokens** (A-chain collateral) and payload.destlToken is the **collateral lToken**, but repayCrossChainBorrowInternal expects **repayAmount** in the **borrowed lToken**.
  Debt is therefore “repaid” with the wrong asset/amount, or the call reverts and blocks the LayerZero queue.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The borrower’s health factor on chain A is below the liquidation threshold.
2. The protocol does **not** transfer repayAmount of borrowedAsset from the liquidator before sending the cross-chain message.

### External Pre-conditions

None; the attack is independent of oracles, gas price or external state.

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker** (liquidator) calls liquidateCrossChain() on chain B, specifying any repayAmount, *without supplying or approving the borrowed asset* (the function lacks transferFrom).
2. Chain A receives the message, sees the borrower is unhealthy and calculates seizeTokens.
3. Chain A transfers the collateral to the protocol (and records the liquidator’s share), then sends a **LiquidationSuccess** message back to chain B with payload.amount \= seizeTokens.
4. Chain B executes  **_handleLiquidationSuccess**:

    - Calls repayCrossChainBorrowInternal with *collateral* values instead of *borrowed-asset* values.
    - The internal transfer from the liquidator either

      - **reverts** (liquidator never approved / owns the collateral lToken) → LayerZero queue is blocked (DoS) and collateral is already gone, **or**
      - **succeeds** if the attacker pre-bought a small amount of collateral lToken, but debt is mis-accounted (bad debt).
5. Attacker withdraws the seized collateral from chain A; the borrower still owes the full debt on chain B.

### Impact

The protocol accrues bad debt equal to the borrower’s outstanding loan while simultaneously transferring collateral (up to  close-factor) to the attacker. Loss ≈ repayAmount × (1 + liquidation incentive). The attacker gains the full seized collateral and pays at most the LayerZero fees (≈ $0.5-3).

### PoC

```sol
# Pseudo-script on chain B
borrower = 0xBadBorrower
borrowedAsset = USDC_B  # debt token
lTokenToSeize = ETH_A_LToken
repayAmount = 1_000e6   # USDC, never supplied

CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain(
    borrower,
    repayAmount,
    srcEid = A_chain_ID,
    lTokenToSeize,
    borrowedAsset
)
# No approval / transferFrom needed
# Observe: attacker receives ETH_A collateral on chain A, debt on chain B unchanged.
```

### Mitigation

1. **Asset &amp; Amount integrity**

    - Include borrowedAsset and repayAmount in the LiquidationSuccess payload.
    - Pass those exact values to repayCrossChainBorrowInternal.
2. **Up-front escrow**

    - In liquidateCrossChain, transferFrom(liquidator, repayAmount) the borrowed asset into the Router before any cross-chain call.
3. **Non-blocking receiver**

    - Use a non-blocking LayerZero pattern so that failed repayments cannot halt the message queue.
