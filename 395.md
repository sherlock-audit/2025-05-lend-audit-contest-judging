# User will over-borrow across multiple chains by exploiting stale collateral checks

### Summary

The stale collateral validation in cross-chain borrowing will cause a complete loss of funds for the protocol as an attacker will exploit LayerZero message delays to borrow more than their collateral value across multiple chains.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:622` the collateral check uses stale collateral amounts from when the cross-chain message was initiated rather than current collateral. The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` function validates `payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed` where `payload.collateral` is a snapshot taken during the initial `borrowCrossChain()` call, not the current collateral balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User deposits 100 ETH collateral on Chain A
2. User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()` to borrow 80 USDC on Chain B - LayerZero message sent with `payload.collateral = 100 ETH`
3. User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()` to borrow 80 USDC on Chain C - LayerZero message sent with `payload.collateral = 100 ETH`
4. User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()` to borrow 80 USDC on Chain D - LayerZero message sent with `payload.collateral = 100 ETH`
5. User withdraws all 100 ETH collateral from Chain A before any LayerZero messages are processed
6. All three borrow requests are processed on destination chains, each validating against the stale 100 ETH collateral amount in `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`
7. User has successfully borrowed 240 USDC with 0 remaining collateral

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss equal to the total borrowed amount. The attacker gains the borrowed funds across multiple chains while having withdrawn their collateral, so no risk of loss for the attacker.
