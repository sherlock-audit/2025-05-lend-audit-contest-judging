# CoreRouter will underpay users during redeem and misreport mint amounts during supply

### Summary

The use of a stale exchange rate in [CoreRouter.redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100-L138) will cause an underpayment for users as the CoreRouter will use exchangeRateStored() before calling redeem(), but redeem() itself triggers accrueInterest() which updates the exchange rate used internally, resulting in more underlying being redeemed than is forwarded to the user.
Additionally, the same stale exchange rate is used in CoreRouter.supply() to estimate minted lTokens, which may lead to incorrect values recorded in events or storage.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol:115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L114-L124), the redeemed underlying is calculated using exchangeRateStored() before calling redeem(), but redeem() internally calls accrueInterest(), updating the exchange rate.
```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 redeemTokens) external override returns (uint256) {
        redeemInternal(redeemTokens);
        return NO_ERROR;
    }
```
```solidity
    function redeemInternal(uint256 redeemTokens) internal nonReentrant {
        accrueInterest();
        // redeemFresh emits redeem-specific logs on errors, so we don't need to
        redeemFresh(payable(msg.sender), redeemTokens, 0);
    }
```
This leads to a mismatch between the actual amount received and what is forwarded to the user.
Additionally, exchangeRateStored() is used in the supply() function to estimate mintTokens, which can become outdated if interest has accrued.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user calls redeem() through the CoreRouter

2. Interest has accrued on the market, but CoreRouter reads exchangeRateStored() before redeem()

3. accrueInterest() is triggered by redeem(), updating the exchange rate



### External Pre-conditions

1. Interest must accrue between the call to exchangeRateStored() and the execution of redeem()

2. Time or block advancement must have occurred (e.g., via warp, roll, or elapsed blocks)

3. There must be non-zero outstanding borrows in the market

### Attack Path

1. A user supplies 100 tokens and receives lTokens

2. The user later borrows tokens to trigger interest accrual conditions

3. After time has passed, the user calls redeem() via CoreRouter

4. CoreRouter reads exchangeRateStored() and computes expectedUnderlying

5. redeem() internally calls accrueInterest() and updates the exchange rate

6. The actual amount of underlying received is greater than expectedUnderlying

7. The router forwards only expectedUnderlying, underpaying the user

8. The difference is silently retained by the router

### Impact

The user suffers an approximate loss equal to the interest accrued between reading exchangeRateStored() and executing redeem(). The protocol silently retains the surplus funds, and the user is underpaid. The discrepancy can increase with longer idle times or higher borrow rates.
In the case of supply(), while there is no direct fund loss, the router may record or emit incorrect mintToken values, which could affect downstream accounting or rewards.

### PoC

Add this script to TestRedeeming.t.sol file.

```solidity
    function test_exchange_rate_mismatch_after_interest_accrual() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // Step 1: Supply tokens
        uint256 supplyAmount = 100e18;
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(supplyAmount);

        // Step 2: Borrow tokens to create interest accrual
        coreRouter.borrow(50e18, token);

        // Step 3: Get lToken balance and stale exchange rate BEFORE redeem
        uint256 lTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        uint256 staleExchangeRate = LTokenInterface(lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Step 4: Advance time and block to accrue interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 days);
        vm.roll(block.number + 2000);

        // Step 5: Redeem 30% of lToken to avoid liquidity shortfall
        uint256 redeemAmount = (lTokenBalance * 30) / 100;
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (redeemAmount * staleExchangeRate ) / 1e18;

        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);
        coreRouter.redeem(redeemAmount, payable(lToken));
        uint256 actualReceived = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer) - balanceBefore;

        // Assert: stale rate was used → user received expectedUnderlying (even though actual lToken redemption yielded more)
        assertEq(actualReceived, expectedUnderlying, "Router uses stale rate for user transfer");

        // Optional: show that true value could be more
        uint256 freshRate = LTokenInterface(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
        uint256 trueRedeem = (redeemAmount * freshRate) / 1e18;

        // Assert: fresh rate is greater than stale rate
        assertTrue(freshRate > staleExchangeRate, "Interest should have accrued");
        // Assert: user was underpaid due to stale rate
        assertTrue(trueRedeem > expectedUnderlying, "User was underpaid due to stale rate");

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Then you can see this result
```bash
Ran 1 test for test/TestRedeeming.t.sol:TestRedeeming
[PASS] test_exchange_rate_mismatch_after_interest_accrual() (gas: 958866)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 6.33ms (1.28ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 14.47ms (6.33ms CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

### Mitigation
✅ For redeem():
Replace the stale exchange rate logic in redeem() with a balance differential:
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualUnderlying = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, actualUnderlying);
```
➕ For supply() (optional improvement):
Use actual balance or mint() return to track mintTokens, if minting to router:
```solidity
uint256 before = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this));
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 after = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualMinted = after - before;
```
This ensures users receive exactly what was redeemed by the lToken contract, regardless of interest accrual timing.
