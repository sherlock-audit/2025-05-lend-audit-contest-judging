# Missing Market Listing Check

## Description

The supply() function in CoreRouter lacks a call to verify that the _lToken is a listed market in the Lendtroller. Specifically, the function does not call:
```solidity
require(LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isMarketListed(LToken(_lToken)), "Market not listed");
```
This omission means that users may interact with unsupported or deprecated markets, which could result in unexpected behavior or funds being locked in a non-functional lending pool.

## Impact

Without ensuring the market is listed:
	•	Users can supply tokens to unlisted or deprecated lTokens.
	•	Funds might get locked if the corresponding lToken contract is no longer functional.
	•	The protocol may fail to track or control supplied assets, leading to accounting inconsistencies or broken flows in redemption/borrowing.

This opens up a denial-of-service (DoS) vector, particularly if a market is deprecated post-deployment and the check isn’t enforced at supply time.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

```solidity
// Assume _token maps to an lToken that is not listed:
// something like that in other contracts:
lendStorage.setTokenToLToken(DAI, unlistedLToken);

// User supplies DAI
coreRouter.supply(1000e18, DAI);

// No check is performed, supply succeeds despite market not being listed
// Later, user might not be able to borrow/redeem due to listing checks elsewhere
```

## Mitigation:
Insert the market listing check into the supply() function.
