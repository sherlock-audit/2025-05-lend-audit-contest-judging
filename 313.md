# Inaccurate maxClose Calculation in Liquidation Logic

### Summary

The liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function calculates the maximum repayable amount (maxClose) using the stale value borrowBalance.amount, which is based on an outdated borrow index. This causes maxClose to be underestimated when interest accrues, potentially preventing valid liquidation attempts that should be allowed.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L353-L354
```solidity
/* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
            uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
                Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
            );
```
The borrowBalance.amount may not be updated according to the new accrue balance.

### Attack Path

A borrower takes out a loan that becomes undercollateralized due to interest accrual or price drops. However, the liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function incorrectly calculates the maxClose (maximum repayable amount) using the stale borrowBalance.amount instead of the updated borrowedAmount that includes accrued interest. This causes the protocol to reject liquidation attempts when repayAmount <= borrowedAmount * closeFactor but repayAmount > borrowBalance.amount * closeFactor. As a result, liquidators are blocked even though the borrower's position is unhealthy. 

### Impact

Liquidators may be blocked from repaying even when the borrower is clearly underwater, which can allow undercollateralized positions to persist longer than intended.

### PoC

1. User borrows 100 Tokens => borrowBalance.amount = 100 and LToken.borrowIndex() = 1e18
2. LToken.borrowIndex() increases to 1.05e18 due to interest. => borrowedAmount = 100 * 1.05e18 / 1e18 = 105
3. Since borrowedAmount (105) > collateral (100) => liquidation is allowed.
4. The user should be allowed to liquidate 105 * 0.9 = 94 ( considering closeFactor is 0.9)
5. However, only 90 will be allowed, causing the position to remain unhealthy and the liquidator get less than what he wants.




### Mitigation

Multiply the maxClose using the updated value, which is: `borrowedAmount`
