# Undefined Price Oracle Behavior Leads to Unlimited Borrows

### Summary

**The Uniswap-anchored price oracle's defined behavior of returning zero for unavailable prices** will cause **severe miscalculations of borrow values**, leading to **unlimited borrowing for users and potential significant bad debt for the protocol**, as **core lending functions (`borrow`, `borrowCrossChain`) rely on these flawed calculations.**

In `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, specifically at lines `vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset);` and `vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(lTokenModify);`, the function does not correctly handle the scenario where `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice()` returns `0`. As per the [Compound `PriceOracle` interface](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/7561dcf5964527dbf2f3c7cd670775b3c6f7e378/contracts/PriceOracle.sol), a return value of `0` explicitly indicates that "the price is unavailable." This `0` is then used in subsequent multiplications, causing the effective value of existing and hypothetical borrowed amounts to be calculated as `0`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* The `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice()` for a specific `LToken` (or its underlying asset) needs to return `0`. This occurs when the oracle deems the price unavailable.

### External Pre-conditions

* The external Uniswap-anchored view oracle returns `0` for a whitelisted standard token, indicating an unavailable price.

### Attack Path

This issue presents a critical unlimited borrow attack:

1.  **Identification of Vulnerable Asset:**
    * An **attacker** identifies a whitelisted standard token for which the `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice()` function, when queried, returns `0`. This indicates that the oracle considers the price of this token as unavailable.

2.  **Initiating Borrow on Source Chain (via `borrow` function):**
    * The **attacker** calls the `borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token)` function, specifying a desired `_amount` to borrow of the vulnerable `_token`.
    * https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152C9-L161C72
    * Inside the `borrow` function, a crucial liquidity check is performed by calling:
        ```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
        ```
    * Within `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, when processing the `_token` (which is the borrowed asset), `vars.oraclePriceMantissa` for this token is set to `0` because `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset)` returns `0`.
    * Consequently, `vars.oraclePrice` becomes `Exp({mantissa: 0})`.
    * The calculations for `vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects` (the `borrowed` return value), such as `mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, totalBorrow, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects)` and `mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, borrowAmount, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects)`, will effectively add `0` to the total borrowed value for this asset.
    * As a result, the `borrowed` value returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` will incorrectly represent a total debt of `0` for the asset, regardless of the `_amount` hypothetically being borrowed.

3.  **Bypassing Collateral Requirement:**
    * Back in the `borrow` function, the check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");` is executed.
    * Since `borrowAmount` is derived from the `borrowed` value (which was calculated as `0` in the previous step), this condition effectively becomes `require(collateral >= 0)`.
    * This check will always evaluate to true, regardless of the attacker's actual collateral value (as long as `collateral` is not negative, which it cannot be), thereby bypassing the intended solvency check.

4.  **Execution of Unlimited Borrow:**
    * Following the bypassed check, the function proceeds to:
        ```solidity
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        ```
    * This allows the protocol to successfully mint and transfer the specified `_amount` of `_token` to the attacker, even though their collateral technically does not support this borrow.
    * The **attacker** can repeat this process with an arbitrarily large `_amount` or multiple times to drain the protocol's reserves of the vulnerable token.

5.  **Cross-Chain Unlimited Borrow (via `borrowCrossChain` and `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`):**
    1.  An **attacker** calls `borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid)` on the source chain, where `_borrowToken` is the vulnerable token whose price is `0` on the `_destEid`.
    2. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617C9-L622C81
    3.  The `borrowCrossChain` function prepares a LayerZero message, which includes a `collateral` value from the source chain (derived from `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0)`). This `collateral` value might be accurate or underestimated depending on the prices of other collateral assets on the source chain.
    4.  On the destination chain, the `_lzReceive` function calls `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid)`.
    5.  Inside `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`, a liquidity check is performed:   
        ```solidity
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
        ```
    6.  Here, `payload.destlToken` corresponds to the vulnerable token on the destination chain. Since its oracle price is `0`, `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calculates `totalBorrowed` as `0`.
    7.  The `require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed)` check thus becomes `require(payload.collateral >= 0)`, which always passes.
    8.  The **attacker** can then initiate a cross-chain borrow of an **arbitrary amount** of `payload.destlToken` on the destination chain regardless of their actual collateral or liquidity.

### Impact

The **protocol and its liquidity providers** suffer an **approximate loss of potentially all funds** for any whitelisted standard token whose price becomes `0` via the oracle, as attackers can perform **unlimited borrows (bad debt)**. The attacker gains the full amount of tokens borrowed.

### PoC

A detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) for this vulnerability is in the works.

### Mitigation

- **Robust Price Validation:** Implement a robust price validation mechanism for `getUnderlyingPrice()` results. This should explicitly check if the returned price is `0` (or below a safe threshold) and, if so, trigger a circuit breaker or revert the transaction, preventing the use of an invalid price in liquidity calculations.
