# When borrowing, updating borrowAmount with only a specific lToken will result in calculation errors.

### Summary

The CoreRouter.borrow() function contains a flawed logic for checking account liquidity and collateral sufficiency before allowing a borrow operation. It incorrectly applies an interest accrual factor specific to the LToken being borrowed to the user's total outstanding debt value across all markets. This miscalculation can lead to an overestimation of the user's effective debt for the check, potentially denying valid borrow requests even when the user has sufficient collateral according to the protocol's overall liquidity assessment rules.

```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
 >@           ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the incorrect application of a market-specific interest factor to a global debt figure within the CoreRouter.borrow() function. The function borrow first calls `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(user, lTokenToBorrow, 0, newBorrowAmount)`. This correctly returns:
- borrowed: The user's total debt value (in USD equivalent) across all LToken markets, including the USD value of the newBorrowAmount currently being requested.
- collateral: The user's total collateral value (in USD equivalent, adjusted by collateral factors) across all supplied assets.

These two values are designed to be directly comparable for a liquidity check.

Next, the function retrieves `currentBorrow.borrowIndex`, which is the user's last recorded market borrow index specifically for the `_lToken` they are currently attempting to borrow.

The critical flaw occurs in the following calculation:

```solidity
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
 >@           ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
```

`borrowed` is the total USD debt value across all markets. `LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex() / currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is the interest accrual factor only for the specific `_lToken` market being borrowed. This operation incorrectly multiplies the user's entire cross-market USD debt value by an interest factor that is only relevant to the single market they are currently interacting with.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. When user has different lTokens borrowed. 
2. The user wants to borrow a specific lToken, but because the lToken has not been updated for a long time, the interest rate is high, which causes all loan amounts to increase, resulting in the failure of the borrowing.

### Impact

The user can't borrowing normally even if collateral is enough.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

For each type of lToken, the interest that needs to be increased should be calculated separately.
