# Incorrect interest accrual in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`

## Summary
The failure to accrue interest for all lTokens in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` and the incorrect application of a single lToken’s `borrowIndex` to the total debt in the `borrow` function will cause users to borrow more than they should or face increased collateral requirements as the calculated `borrowAmount` is inaccurately estimated, potentially leading to unwarranted liquidations.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol` within the `borrow` function, `accrueInterest` is called only for the lToken being borrowed, and `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` does not accrue interest for other lTokens in `borrowedAssets`. Additionally, the total debt (`borrowed`) is scaled by the `borrowIndex` of the borrowed lToken, despite each lToken having its own interest rate model.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The user needs to have existing borrows in at least two different lTokens with distinct interest rate models (e.g., 10% APY for cWBTC, 2% APY for cUSDC).
2. The lToken pools need to have no interactions (e.g., `borrow`, `repay`) for several hours to accumulate significant interest (e.g., at least 0.1% growth in `borrowIndex`).
3. The user needs to have a significant total borrow value (e.g., equivalent to $10,000 or more) to make the underestimated debt or inflated collateral requirement impactful.
4. The lToken being borrowed needs to have a lower interest rate than other lTokens to underestimate the total debt.

## Attack Path
1. A user with borrows in two lTokens (e.g., 1000 USDC in cUSDC at 2% APY, 1000 WBTC in cWBTC at 10% APY, worth $1000 USD) calls `borrow` to borrow 500 USDC (cUSDC).
2. The Router invokes `accrueInterest` on cUSDC, updating its `borrowIndex` to 1.000274 (0.0274% after 12 hours), but not on cWBTC, leaving its `borrowIndex` at 1.0.
3. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calculates:
   - cUSDC: 1000.274 USDC (1000 * 1.000274) + 500 USDC = 1500.274 USDC.
   - cWBTC: 1000 USD (no interest accrued, outdated `borrowIndex`).
   - Total `borrowed` = 2500.274 USD.
4. The Router calculates `borrowAmount` = (2500.274 * 1.000274) / 1.0 ≈ 2500.959 USD, applying cUSDC’s low `borrowIndex` to the entire debt.
5. The user needs collateral for only 2500.959 USD, instead of ~2501.37 USD (with cWBTC at 1001.37 USD after 0.137% interest).
6. The user borrows more than allowed, as the debt is underestimated.
7. A later interaction (e.g., `repay` on cWBTC) invokes `accrueInterest`, updating cWBTC’s `borrowIndex` to 1.00137, increasing the total debt to ~2501.644 USD, potentially triggering liquidation if collateral is insufficient.

## Impact
The user may borrow more than their collateral allows due to underestimated debt, risking **unwarranted liquidation** when other lTokens’ interest is accrued later, causing significant losses (e.g., >$10 of collateral for a $2500 debt). Alternatively, if the borrowed lToken has a higher interest rate, users face inflated collateral requirements, limiting borrowing capability. Both scenarios break core borrowing functionality. The opportunity cost of locked collateral or missed borrowing opportunities exceeds 0.01% and $10 for users with significant principal (e.g., $10,000). Liquidations result in substantial collateral loss, benefiting liquidators and protocol (via fees) but damaging user trust and protocol activity long-term.

The same error is in `liquidateBorrow`, where first the debt is counted, and then in validation `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` are added back to the amount based on only one token. Based on this value, a decision is made about a possible liquidation, which may be based on incorrect (underestimated or overestimated) data.

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy two lToken pools: cUSDC (2% APY) and cWBTC (10% APY). A user has 1000 USDC borrowed in cUSDC and 1000 WBTC in cWBTC (worth $1000 USD, assuming 1 WBTC = 1 USDC for simplicity).
- Allow pools to remain inactive for 12 hours, accruing 0.0274% interest for cUSDC (`borrowIndex` = 1.000274) and 0.137% for cWBTC (if accrued, `borrowIndex` = 1.00137).
- The user calls `borrow` for 500 USDC (cUSDC).
- `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` computes:
  - cUSDC: 1000.274 USDC + 500 = 1500.274 USDC.
  - cWBTC: 1000 USD (no `accrueInterest`, outdated `borrowIndex`).
  - Total `borrowed` = 2500.274 USD.
- `borrowAmount` = (2500.274 * 1.000274) ≈ 2500.959 USD, underestimating the debt by ~0.685 USD compared to 2501.644 USD (with cWBTC at 1001.37 USD).
- The user provides collateral for 2500.959 USD (e.g., 3751.439 USD at 150% collateral ratio), which is insufficient for the true debt of 2501.644 USD (requiring 3752.466 USD).
- A subsequent `repay` on cWBTC triggers `accrueInterest`, updating cWBTC’s debt to 1001.37 USD, increasing total debt to 2501.644 USD.
- If collateral remains at 3751.439 USD, the collateral ratio falls below 150% (3751.439 / 2501.644 ≈ 149.9%), triggering liquidation, costing the user ~$10+ in collateral.
- For a $10,000 principal, a 0.137% underestimation results in a $13.70 liquidation risk, meeting medium severity.

## Mitigation
1. Invoke `accrueInterest` for all lTokens in `borrowedAssets` within `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` before calculating their borrow balances.
2. Remove the redundant `borrowIndex` scaling in `borrowAmount`, using the `borrowed` value directly from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. Example:
```solidity
// In getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral
for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length;) {
    LToken asset = LToken(borrowedAssets[i]);
    asset.accrueInterest(); // Accrue interest for each lToken
    uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));
    totalBorrow += borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset));
    ...
}
// In borrow
uint256 borrowAmount = borrowed; // Use directly
require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
