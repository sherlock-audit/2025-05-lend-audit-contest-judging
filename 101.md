# Protocol will lose accumulated liquidation rewards due to missing withdrawal mechanism

### Summary

The missing withdrawal function will cause a permanent loss of accumulated liquidation rewards for the protocol as there is no mechanism to claim the `protocolReward` tokens that are accumulated during liquidations.

### Root Cause

The `CoreRouter::liquidateSeizeUpdate()` and `CrossChainRouter::_handleLiquidationExecute()` functions accumulate protocol rewards from liquidations, but neither `CoreRouter`, `CrossChainRouter` nor `LendStorage` provides any function to withdraw these accumulated rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Liquidations need to occur to accumulate `protocolReward` tokens in `lendStorage.protocolReward[lToken]`
2. Protocol rewards need to be greater than 0 for the affected lTokens

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

This is not an attack path but a vulnerability path:

1. **Liquidations occur** in the protocol through `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrow()` or cross-chain liquidations
2. **Protocol rewards accumulate** via `lendStorage.updateProtocolReward()` calls
3. **Rewards remain permanently locked** as no withdrawal mechanism exists for the protocol to claim accumulated rewards

### Impact

The protocol permanently loses all accumulated liquidation rewards as they remain locked in the `LendStorage` contract forever. These rewards represent 2.8% of all seized collateral from liquidations across all markets and chains, which could amount to significant value over time depending on liquidation volume.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a withdrawal function to `LendStorage` that allows the protocol owner to claim accumulated rewards.
