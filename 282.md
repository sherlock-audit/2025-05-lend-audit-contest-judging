# Liquidators cannot retrieve any collateral after liquidations

### Summary

Due to a missing call to token seizure, the liquidator does not earn anything after a liquidation.

### Root Cause

The [liquidateSeizeUpdate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L241) function does the following:

- Updates the protocol reward
- Distribute rewards
- Updates total investment of the borrower
- Updates total investment of the sender

There is one step missing, which is to call the seize function from the lToken contract. This omission means that the lToken contract's internal balances are never updated to transfer ownership of the lTokens from the borrower to the liquidator. 

The liquidator, despite paying to cover the borrower's debt through repayBorrowInternal, does not actually receive the collateral in a usable form.

### Impact

Liquidators won't be able to retrieve their tokens, and they'll lose assets as they're repaying for these assets without receiving any seized collateral. 

### PoC

Run the test below on TestLiquidations.t.sol

```solidity
function test_liquidation_after_price_drop_plus_balance_bug(uint256 supplyAmount, uint256 borrowAmount, uint256 newPrice) public {
        // This mirrors test_liquidation_after_price_drop until the checks at the end
        supplyAmount = bound(supplyAmount, 100e18, 1000e18);
        borrowAmount = bound(borrowAmount, 50e18, supplyAmount * 60 / 100); // Max 60% LTV
        newPrice = bound(newPrice, 1e16, 5e16); // 1-5% of original price

        (address tokenA, address lTokenA) = _supplyA(deployer, supplyAmount, 0);
        (address tokenB, address lTokenB) = _supplyA(address(1), supplyAmount, 1);

        vm.prank(deployer);
        coreRouterA.borrow(borrowAmount, tokenB);

        priceOracleA.setDirectPrice(tokenA, newPrice);
        priceOracleB.setDirectPrice(
            lendStorageB.lTokenToUnderlying(lendStorageB.crossChainLTokenMap(lTokenA, block.chainid)), newPrice
        );

        vm.startPrank(liquidator);
        ERC20Mock(tokenB).mint(liquidator, borrowAmount);
        IERC20(tokenB).approve(address(coreRouterA), borrowAmount);

        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit LiquidateBorrow(liquidator, lTokenB, deployer, lTokenA);

        uint256 repayAmount = borrowAmount / 200;

        coreRouterA.liquidateBorrow(deployer, repayAmount, lTokenA, tokenB);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertLt(
            lendStorageA.borrowWithInterest(deployer, lTokenB),
            borrowAmount,
            "Borrow should be reduced after liquidation"
        );

        // POC: Verify the liquidator's LToken balance
        // LendStorage shows the liquidator has "earned" an investment in the collateral LToken (lTokenA).
        assertTrue(
            lendStorageA.totalInvestment(liquidator, lTokenA) > 0,
            "LendStorage: Liquidator's investment in collateral LToken should be > 0"
        );
        // However, the liquidator's actual balance of lTokenA in the LToken contract is 0,
        // because CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate misses the LTokenCollateral.seize(...) call.
        assertEq(LToken(lTokenA).balanceOf(liquidator), 0, "LToken: Liquidator's actual lTokenA balance should be 0");
    }
```
And running with `-vvv`, we see getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral is returning zero for the collateral.
