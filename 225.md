# A borrower's borrowed amount is double accounted during a liquidation

### Summary

A borrower's borrowed amount is double accounted during a liquidation.

### Root Cause

When a borrower's position is liquidated, protocol calculates the sum of borrowed amount plus effects, and the sum of collateral by calling `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`.

[CoreRouter.sol#L238-L239](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L238-L239):
```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);
```

`borrowed` value returned by `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is the borrower's borrowed amount including accrued interests.

[LendStorage.sol#L424-L425](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L424-L425):
```solidity
            // Get borrow balance for this asset
            uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));
```

[LendStorage.sol#L509-L515](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L509-L515):
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterestSame(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 borrowIndex = borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].borrowIndex;
        uint256 borrowBalanceSameChain = borrowIndex != 0
            ? (borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex())) / borrowIndex
            : 0;
        return borrowBalanceSameChain;
    }
```

Later in the process of liquidation, the borrowed amount is again multiplied by the accrued interest index, leading to the borrowed amount is double accounted.

[CoreRouter.sol#L343-L350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L343-L350):
```solidity
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
@>          borrowedAmount =
@>              (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

As a result, the borrower's position can be liquidated even if it is not liquidatable.

### Mitigation

```diff
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
-           uint256 borrowedAmount;
+           uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowed;

-           // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
-           borrowedAmount =
-               (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```
