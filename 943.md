# Incorrect Borrow Index Calculation Will Allow Invalid Liquidations

### Summary

A issue in the liquidation check calculation will cause incorrect liquidation decisions as the protocol uses the wrong borrow index for calculating the borrowed amount. This leads to potential invalid liquidations when positions are actually healthy.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol:347-350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347-L350), the [`liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L329-L361) function incorrectly uses the current borrowIndex instead of the stored borrowIndex when calculating the borrowed amount. The function takes the current borrowIndex from the lToken contract and divides by the stored borrowBalance.borrowIndex, which can lead to incorrect calculations if the indices have diverged significantly.

```solidity


            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            
      
            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");


```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The current borrowIndex of the lToken must be different from the stored borrowBalance.borrowIndex
- The borrower must have a position that is healthy in USD terms
- The liquidator must attempt to liquidate the position
- The market must not be deprecated

### External Pre-conditions

- The interest rates must have changed since the borrower's last interaction with the protocol
- The price oracle must be functioning correctly to provide accurate USD values

### Attack Path

1. A borrower takes out a loan when borrowIndex is 1.0e18
2. Interest rates change, causing current borrowIndex to increase to 1.5e18
3. The borrower's position remains healthy in USD terms
4. A liquidator attempts to liquidate the position
5. The liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function incorrectly calculates the borrowed amount by using the current borrowIndex instead of the stored one
6. The liquidation check passes even though the position is actually healthy

### Impact

This vulnerability directly impacts the protocol's risk management system by allowing invalid liquidations to occur. When positions are healthy, the protocol should prevent liquidations to protect borrowers. If liquidations are incorrectly allowed, borrowers may lose their collateral unnecessarily, leading to potential legal and reputational issues for the protocol. The impact is particularly severe during periods of high interest rate volatility when the indices can diverge significantly.

### PoC

```solidity
// Initial state
borrowed = 1000 USD
collateral = 1200 USD
current borrowIndex = 1.5e18
stored borrowBalance.borrowIndex = 1.0e18

// Current calculation in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * current borrowIndex) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex
borrowedAmount = (1000 * 1.5e18) / 1.0e18 = 1500 USD

// The check passes because 1500 > 1200 is true
// But the position should not be liquidatable as 1000 > 1200 is false
```

### Mitigation

The fix is to use the stored borrowIndex for both the numerator and denominator to maintain consistency:

```diff

-       uint256 borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
+       uint256 borrowedAmount = (borrowed * borrowBalance.borrowIndex) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
        require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

 
```
