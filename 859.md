# Decimal Mismatch in `CoreRouter::supply()` Function Leads to Excessive lToken Minting

### Summary 
The [`supply()` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L80)function in the protocol allows users to supply whitelisted ERC20 tokens (BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT) as stated in the docs. 
However, the function incorrectly assumes all tokens use 18 decimals when performing calculations related to minting lTokens. This can result in inaccurate mint amounts and incorrect accounting, particularly for tokens like USDT, USDC (6 decimals), and WBTC (8 decimals) which deviate from the standard 18 decimals.

This discrepancy can be exploited by users supplying lower-decimal tokens to receive disproportionately high lToken balances or cause economic imbalances within the protocol.

### Root Cause 
The protocol’s `supply()` function uses this line to calculate minted tokens:
```javascript
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```
Here, `_amount` is in the native decimals of the supplied token (e.g. 6 for USDT, 8 for WBTC) but is multiplied directly by 1e18 without normalizing it to a consistent 18-decimal standard first.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker supplies a token like USDT (6 decimals).

2. The protocol multiplies `_amount * 1e18`, assuming `_amount` was in 18 decimals, even though it’s in 6 decimals.

3. This results in a 100x inflated mintTokens calculation compared to a proper normalized value.

4. The attacker receives more lTokens than they should relative to the actual supplied value.

5. The attacker can then borrow against the inflated lToken balance or withdraw excessive rewards, leading to financial imbalance and potential insolvency for the protocol.

### Impact 
An attacker can exploit this by supplying small amounts of USDT (or any token with less than 18 decimals) and receiving massively inflated lTokens in return. They can then:
- Borrow significantly more than they supplied.
- Withdraw excessive protocol rewards.
- Drain protocol liquidity and destabilize lending pools.

### Recommendation
Implement proper decimal normalization for all supplied tokens before using them in calculations
