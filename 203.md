# CoreRouter borrowForCrossChain Missing Debt Attribution

# Vulnerability Report: CoreRouter borrowForCrossChain Missing Debt Attribution

## Summary
Missing internal accounting in the `borrowForCrossChain` function will cause an accounting discrepancy for the lending protocol as CoreRouter becomes the debtor instead of the end user, allowing users to borrow without proper collateral requirements being enforced.

## Root cause
The `borrowForCrossChain` function lacks essential LendStorage state updates to attribute cross-chain debt to the actual borrower.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L195-L205

The function fails to call:
1. `lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(_borrower, _destlToken, _amount, borrowIndex)`
2. `lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(_borrower, _destlToken)`

These calls are present in the regular `borrow` function but missing in `borrowForCrossChain`.

### Internal Pre-conditions
N/A

### External Pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral on Chain A through the regular protocol mechanisms
2. User initiates a cross-chain borrow through CrossChainRouter on Chain A to borrow assets on Chain B
3. CrossChainRouter on Chain B calls CoreRouter's `borrowForCrossChain` function
4. CoreRouter on Chain B executes `LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount)`, which records CoreRouter itself as the borrower at the LToken level
5. CoreRouter transfers the borrowed tokens to the user with `IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount)`
6. **Critical vulnerability**: CoreRouter does not call `lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance()` or `lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset()` to record this debt against the user
7. As a result, the user's debt is not properly recorded in LendStorage on Chain B
8. When calculating the user's liquidity position, the protocol cannot correctly account for these cross-chain borrows
9. This allows the user to potentially borrow more than their collateral allows by performing multiple cross-chain borrows
10. The protocol cannot properly liquidate the user's position when it becomes undercollateralized, as the debt records in LendStorage are incomplete

### Impact
The protocol suffers potential insolvency as it cannot properly track or liquidate undercollateralized positions.

        console.log("User borrowed %d tokens via crossChainRouter without LendStorage recording it", borrowAmount);
    }
}

```
### Mitigation
Add the missing LendStorage updates to the `borrowForCrossChain` function:

```solidity
function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
    external
{
    require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");
    require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
    
    // Borrow tokens
    require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
    
    // Transfer tokens to borrower
    IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    
    // Update LendStorage to attribute this debt to the actual borrower
    lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
        _borrower, 
        _destlToken, 
        _amount, 
        LTokenInterface(_destlToken).borrowIndex()
    );
    lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(_borrower, _destlToken);
}
```
