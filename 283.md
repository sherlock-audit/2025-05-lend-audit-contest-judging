# Mixing protocol-wide borrow value with token-specific index leads to inconsistent liquidation eligibility

## Description:
In the `CoreRouter` contract’s `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` function, the protocol uses a global borrowed amount from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` in combination with a token-specific borrow index to determine liquidation eligibility. This can lead to incorrect or inconsistent liquidation logic, as it mixes protocol-wide debt (across all tokens) with the index of a specific token market. This inconsistency could result in either under-liquidation or over-liquidation.

```solidity
function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
    address payable lTokenBorrowed,
    address borrower,
    uint256 repayAmount,
    uint256 collateral,
    uint256 borrowed
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);
    
    if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
        require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
    } else {
        uint256 borrowedAmount;
        
        // @audit using total borrowed amount (borrowed) with specific token's index (borrowBalance.borrowIndex)
        borrowedAmount =
            (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
        
        require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
        // ... rest of the function
    }
}
```

Here, `borrowed` is the protocol-wide debt in USD terms, while `borrowBalance.borrowIndex` is the index specific to the `lTokenBorrowed` market. Combining these without proper normalization could create an inaccurate assessment of the borrower’s liquidity position.

## Attack path:
1. A borrower supplies multiple tokens as collateral and takes loans in different tokens.
2. Due to differences in borrow indices and USD conversion across tokens, the global debt reported by getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() may not align properly with the token-specific borrow index.
3. An attacker could exploit discrepancies by strategically borrowing and repaying to push the index ratio in their favor, potentially avoiding liquidation when it should be triggered (or vice versa).
4. This could cause the protocol to incorrectly approve or deny liquidations, leading to unfair liquidations or loss of funds.

## Impact:
This logic flaw can result in inconsistent liquidation eligibility, leading to unfair liquidations, incorrect protocol accounting, or even potential manipulation by sophisticated users.

## Recommended Mitigation:
Align debt calculations by ensuring that both the borrowed amount and the borrow index reference the same token or are normalized consistently. Instead of using the protocol-wide debt, refactor the function to fetch the specific borrowed amount for the `lTokenBorrowed` market (using `lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed)`) and calculate liquidation eligibility based solely on that token’s debt and index. This ensures consistent accounting and prevents mismatches between global and token-specific states.
