### Attack Path

Assume that there are three (3) chains. Chain A, B, and C.

There are a few issues within the design of `borrowCrossChain()` function that allow malicious users to exploit this function to steal assets:

1. The amount of assets borrowed is not recorded directly within the `borrowCrossChain()` function until a response is sent by the destination chain and processed by the `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` function
2. There is no validation to ensure that the collateral exceeds the borrowed amount or outstanding debts before allowing the `borrowCrossChain` transaction to submitted.

Assume that Bob is a malicious user and he could perform the following actions to steal assets:

- Bob adds 3 WETH as collateral in Chain A, which is worth approximately 10,000 USD in value. The LTV of WETH collateral is 90%, which means that he can borrow around 9,000 USD worth of supported assets.
- On Chain A, Bob submits two (2) `borrowCrossChain` transactions (TX) within the same block in Chain A. The 1st TX will borrow 9,000 USDT from Chain B, and the 2nd TX will borrow 9,000 USDT from Chain C. Note that the key point is to send both transactions at the same time within the same block.
- When the Chain B router processes the incoming message, it will determine that there is sufficient collateral (10,000 collateral), and send 9,000 USDT to Bob, and prepare a response to be sent back to Chain A router.
- About the same time, similarly, the Chain C router will also process the incoming message, it will determine that there is sufficient collateral (10,000 collateral), and send 9,000 USDT to Bob, and prepare a response to be sent back to Chain A router.
- Thus, Bob received a total of 18,000 USDT with just 10,000 USD worth of WETH collateral, effectively stealing funds from the protocol and leaving the protocol with bad debt.
