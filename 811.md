# Missing addUserSuppliedAsset Call for Liquidator After Seizing Collateral

### Title
Missing addUserSuppliedAsset Call for Liquidator After Seizing Collateral

### Severity
Medium

### Impact
When a liquidator seizes collateral (destlToken) on Chain A, the code updates the liquidator’s totalInvestment but does not register destlToken in their userSuppliedAssets array. As a result:
•	`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` will not see the newly seized tokens as valid collateral if the liquidator later attempts to borrow or redeem against them.
•	The liquidator’s future borrowing power is understated (their seized assets exist in totalInvestment but are not “entered” as a market), potentially blocking legitimate subsequent operations.

### Likelihood
High
•	Every cross‐chain liquidation that succeeds and credits collateral to a liquidator hits this code path.
•	Any liquidator who later tries to borrow or redeem with those tokens will face the issue.


### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol

## Description
In `_handleLiquidationExecute` (inside CrossChainRouter.sol), after calculating `liquidatorShare` of seized collateral, the code does:
```solidity
// Distribute LEND rewards omitted for brevity…

// Update total investment for borrower
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    payload.sender,
    payload.destlToken,
    lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) - payload.amount
);

// Update total investment for liquidator
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    payload.liquidator,
    payload.destlToken,
    lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
);

// Clear user supplied asset for borrower if now zero…
```
Notice that there is no call to `lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken)` before updating the liquidator’s total investment. Consequently:
1.	The liquidator’s `totalInvestment[lToken][destlToken]` is increased, but `destlToken` is not present in `userSuppliedAssets[liquidator]`.
2.	Later, if the liquidator calls `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(liquidator, LToken(destlToken), redeemTokens, borrowAmount)`, the function will loop over `userSuppliedAssets[liquidator]` and will not include `destlToken`. It thus treats the liquidator as having zero collateral, even though totalInvestment is nonzero.

This mismatch prevents the liquidator from using their seized collateral to back new borrows or to redeem (for LEND accrual) because the helpers rely on the asset being in the `userSuppliedAssets` list.


## Exploit Scenario


## Recommendations
Immediately after seizing collateral (before updating totalInvestment), register `destlToken` in the liquidator’s `userSuppliedAssets` list. For example, in `_handleLiquidationExecute`, modify the code as follows:
```solidity
        // Update total investment for borrower
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            payload.sender,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) - payload.amount
        );

+        // Ensure the liquidator’s destlToken is tracked as a supplied asset
+        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken);

        // Update total investment for liquidator
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
        );
```
By calling addUserSuppliedAsset first, you guarantee that subsequent calls to `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` recognize `destlToken` as a valid collateral market for the liquidator. This lets them borrow or redeem against the seized tokens as expected.
