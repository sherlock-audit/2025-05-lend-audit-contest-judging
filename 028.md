# Incorrect Borrow Accounting in `borrowWithInterest()` Function

### **Summary**

The `borrowWithInterest()` function in the lend protocol fails to correctly account for cross-chain borrows that originate on the current chain when the destination chain differs. This is due to a logical flaw in the condition that checks both `srcEid` and `destEid` against the current chain ID (`currentEid`).

As a result, legitimate borrows are not counted, leading to situations where attackers can borrow without any accounting, interest accrual, or risk of liquidation.

### **Vulnerable Code**

```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
```

### **Description**

This function attempts to calculate the total borrowed amount (with interest) for a user on the current chain. It does so by checking both `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` mappings and applying interest adjustments based on the stored `borrowIndex`.

The flawed assumption is that for any valid borrow, both `srcEid` (source chain where borrow was initiated) and `destEid` (destination chain where collateral is bridged) should be equal to `currentEid`. However, in real cross-chain borrow scenarios:

1. The source chain (where the borrow originated) is responsible for interest accrual.

2. The destination chain holds collateral, but does not track or accrue interest.

### **Exploit Scenario**

Step 1: Attacker initiates a borrow on Chain A (`srcEid` = A)

Step 2: Protocol bridges collateral to Chain B (`destEid` = B)

Step 3: Borrow is stored in `crossChainCollaterals[attacker][token]`

Step 4: On Chain A, the `borrowWithInterest()` function runs:

`srcEid` == `currentEid` 

`destEid!` = `currentEid` 

So the function skips this borrow entirely

Step 5:  Attacker's debt is not counted

Attacker:
Is never liquidated
Never pays interest
Can recursively drain funds or avoid repaying the loan

### **Impact**

Attacker owes money but the protocol on `Chain A` believes their borrow balance is `0`
Interest revenue is never collected
Liquidation thresholds are bypassed

Attacker may:
Withdraw remaining collateral
Repeat on other chains
Never repay the debt
Drain protocol funds

### **Recommended Fix**

Change: 
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
```

To: 
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
```
