# Cross-Chain Repayment Logic Leads to Borrow Asset Removal

### Summary

When a user repays their last cross-chain borrow for a specific asset type, the protocol incorrectly removes that asset from the user's list of borrowed assets, even if the user still holds an outstanding local borrow of the same asset. This miscalculation of a user's total debt allows them to borrow additional funds or withdraw collateral beyond their actual capacity, leading to undercollateralized loans and potential protocol insolvency.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the _updateRepaymentState function within the cross-chain repayment flow. Specifically, the condition if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) is used to determine whether to call lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken). This condition is flawed because it only checks the number of cross-chain collateral entries for a particular asset. It does not account for any local borrows of the same asset that the user might still have outstanding.

This removes the _lToken from the userBorrowedAssets mapping, which is the primary source for `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to calculate a user's total borrowed amount. As a result, the existing local borrow for that _lToken is no longer factored into the user's total debt calculation.
Similarly `_handleDestRepayMessage` function also removes an asset if cross-chain debts are removed.

```solidity
  function _updateRepaymentState(
        ...
    ) private {
        uint256 currentBorrowIndex = LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex();
        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCrossChainCollaterals = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(borrower, _token);

        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
            if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
                lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
            }
        } else {
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_updateRepaymentState incorrectly removes an asset from the overall userBorrowedAssets list when only the cross-chain specific entry for that asset is fully repaid.
getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral relies on userBorrowedAssets to sum all debt.


### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User takes a local borrow (e.g., 100 USDC).
2. User takes a cross-chain borrow of the same asset (e.g., 50 USDC).
3. User fully repays the cross-chain borrow (50 USDC).
4. The system mistakenly removes USDC from the user's "borrowed assets" list, even though the 100 USDC local borrow is still active.
5. The system now thinks the user has no USDC debt. The user can then borrow more or withdraw collateral, making their actual position severely undercollateralized.

### Impact

The protocol will accrue significant bad debt as users can borrow against non-existent or insufficient collateral.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify _updateRepaymentState and _handleDestRepayMessage to only remove an asset from userBorrowedAssets if all outstanding debt (both local and cross-chain) for that specific asset has been fully repaid
