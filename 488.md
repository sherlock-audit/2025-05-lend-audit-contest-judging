# LEND rewards are incorrectly distributed more times than it should when repaying the cross chain borrows

### Summary

Whenever a borrower repays their borrowed amount of tokens, some LEND rewards are distributed to them in the end, This is same for both - the same chain and the cross chain borrows.
However this is done incorrectly in the case of cross chain borrows repayment.

When a user who borrowed using cross chain borrow functionality decides to repay the cross chain borrow using the `repayCrossChainBorrow` function in the `CoreRouter.sol`. This function `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` which then performs some computations and validations and then calls the internal function `_handleRepayment` . (Remember the flow till here as we will return to what happens after the next step). This calls the [repayCrosschainLiquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L425) in the `CoreRouter` which then calls the `repayBorrowInternal` this function again perform some computation and validations, specifically, the `borrowedAmount` is returned and checked. After this the the repay amount is transferred from the caller to the contract and then as mentioned above the LEND rewards are updated/distributed [here when the distributeBorrowerLend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L487) is called. Now till here the flow was correct as mentioned above that the LEND is distributed. However the issue is- coming back to the flow- after the `_handleRepayment` function -> the [_updateRepaymentState](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L386C4-L392C11) function is called in the end and what the function does is that updates the state and right after that it **again UPDATES and  DISTRIBUTES the LEND rewards**
This is incorrect for 1 or 2 reasons. Firstly as mentioned above, these have already been distributed before in the CoreRouter. Moreover another thing that is worth noting is that even if the above is design choice or intended- When repayment is done in the same chain too like when its directly done in the `CoreRouter.sol` these LEND are distributed before state of the amounts are updated so this will still cause issues- see the below code snippet, notice that its done before hand
```solidity
        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower); // <-


        // Repay borrowed tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");


        // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex() //<-
            );
        }
```
Wheread when again it is done its done after the update. :
```solidity
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
            if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
                lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
            }
        } else {
            userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle = borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal;
            userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index, userCrossChainCollaterals[index]);
        }


        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower); //AUDIT: the distribution is done again first of all and also is done after the state is updated/amount is deducted
```


### Root Cause

Inconsistency when the LEND is distributed in case of repaying cross chain borrows 
LEND rewards distributed incorrectly in case of repayment of the cross-chain borrows


### Internal Pre-conditions

User borrows using the cross-chain borrow
And then repays some amount

### External Pre-conditions

No Response

### Attack Path

See summary

### Impact

Firstly the rewards are distributed again, like twice, so that will make for the borrower getting double reward and even if that is intended or something, they are distributed after the amount is deducted from the state, when it should be done beforehand,. This also differs from the repayment of the same-chain borrows which is done directly via calling the repay function in the CoreRouter.sol 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the code so that the LEND is distributed only once and that is in the `repayBorrowInternal` when it is called inside the `_handleRepayments`
