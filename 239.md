# Cross-Chain Liquidation is Impossible Due to Incorrectly Passing `lToken` to `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()`

### Summary

The cross-chain liquidation flow always fails because the `lToken` is incorrectly passed to `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` instead of the underlying token. As a result, the borrow amount is always zero, making the max repay amount zero and preventing any liquidation from proceeding.

### Root Cause

The liquidation logic passes the `lToken` to `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` (this can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L229)), but the collaterals data is stored using the underlying token as the key (this can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L643)). This mismatch causes the function to return a zero borrow amount, blocking all liquidations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A â€“ the issue occurs due to the incorrect input of `lToken` regardless of internal state.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Cross-chain liquidations are impossible to execute due to maxRepay always being zero.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the underlying asset address instead of the `lToken` when calling `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` for cross-chain liquidations.
