# Protocol Seized Collateral is Permanently Locked Due to Unclaimable protocolReward

### Summary

Lack of processing logic for protocolReward will cause protocol collateral to become permanently locked for the protocol as no actor will be able to claim or transfer accumulated rewards from liquidations.

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate(), a portion of seized tokens (currentReward) is added to protocolReward via lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(). However, the protocol does not implement any logic to claim, transfer, or use these accumulated protocolReward balances.

```solidity
    function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
        address sender,
        address borrower,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address borrowedlToken,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) internal {
        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
            .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");
        uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

        // Just for safety, Never gonna occur
        if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
            currentReward = 0;
        }
        // Update protocol reward
        lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Any user needs to call liquidate() or another function that leads to liquidateSeizeUpdate()
Lend protocol sets PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA() > 0, meaning some portion of liquidation rewards is allocated to the protocol






### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of usable revenue, as its rightful liquidation rewards become inaccessible



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a function such as claimProtocolReward(address lToken, address to) callable by an authorized role to transfer protocolReward
