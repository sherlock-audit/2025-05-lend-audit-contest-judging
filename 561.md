# No _getPeerOrRevert in lzReceive could lead to malicious payloads entering the Protocol.

### Summary

The `CrossChainRouter.sol::_lzReceive()` is used to receive cross-chain messages and carry out further actions.

It overrides the `OAppReceiver::_lzReceive()` which has a implementation:


```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Entry point for receiving messages or packets from the endpoint.
     * @param _origin The origin information containing the source endpoint and sender address.
     *  - srcEid: The source chain endpoint ID.
     *  - sender: The sender address on the src chain.
     *  - nonce: The nonce of the message.
     * @param _guid The unique identifier for the received LayerZero message.
     * @param _message The payload of the received message.
     * @param _executor The address of the executor for the received message.
     * @param _extraData Additional arbitrary data provided by the corresponding executor.
     *
     * @dev Entry point for receiving msg/packet from the LayerZero endpoint.
     */
    function lzReceive(
        Origin calldata _origin,
        bytes32 _guid,
        bytes calldata _message,
        address _executor,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) public payable virtual {
        // Ensures that only the endpoint can attempt to lzReceive() messages to this OApp.
        if (address(endpoint) != msg.sender) revert OnlyEndpoint(msg.sender);

        // Ensure that the sender matches the expected peer for the source endpoint.
        if (_getPeerOrRevert(_origin.srcEid) != _origin.sender) revert OnlyPeer(_origin.srcEid, _origin.sender);

        // Call the internal OApp implementation of lzReceive.
        _lzReceive(_origin, _guid, _message, _executor, _extraData);
    }
```
.

The protocol admin implemetns a setPeer function according to [LayerZeroDocs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/concepts/applications/oapp-standard#peer-and-endpoint-management)

here is the setPeer function from the `OAppCore.sol`

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Sets the peer address (OApp instance) for a corresponding endpoint.
     * @param _eid The endpoint ID.
     * @param _peer The address of the peer to be associated with the corresponding endpoint.
     *
     * @dev Only the owner/admin of the OApp can call this function.
     * @dev Indicates that the peer is trusted to send LayerZero messages to this OApp.
     * @dev Set this to bytes32(0) to remove the peer address.
     * @dev Peer is a bytes32 to accommodate non-evm chains.
     */
    function setPeer(uint32 _eid, bytes32 _peer) public virtual onlyOwner {
        _setPeer(_eid, _peer);
    }


    /**
     * @notice Sets the peer address (OApp instance) for a corresponding endpoint.
     * @param _eid The endpoint ID.
     * @param _peer The address of the peer to be associated with the corresponding endpoint.
     *
     * @dev Indicates that the peer is trusted to send LayerZero messages to this OApp.
     * @dev Set this to bytes32(0) to remove the peer address.
     * @dev Peer is a bytes32 to accommodate non-evm chains.
     */
    function _setPeer(uint32 _eid, bytes32 _peer) internal virtual {
        peers[_eid] = _peer;
        emit PeerSet(_eid, _peer);
    }

```

. 

There is also a check in the `_lzSend` of the OAppSender.sol of the protocol



```solidity
    function _lzSend(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        bytes memory _message,
        bytes memory _options,
        MessagingFee memory _fee,
        address _refundAddress
    ) internal virtual returns (MessagingReceipt memory receipt) {
        // @dev Push corresponding fees to the endpoint, any excess is sent back to the _refundAddress from the endpoint.
        uint256 messageValue = _payNative(_fee.nativeFee);
        if (_fee.lzTokenFee > 0) _payLzToken(_fee.lzTokenFee);

        return
            // solhint-disable-next-line check-send-result
            endpoint.send{ value: messageValue }(
                MessagingParams(_dstEid, _getPeerOrRevert(_dstEid), _message, _options, _fee.lzTokenFee > 0),
                _refundAddress
            );
    }
```

i.e _getPeerOrRevert which reverts if the dstId is not the peer.


But we lack a siimilar check in the [CrossChainRouter::_lzReceive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L742)/


We must implement a check so as to make sure the sender is a trusted peer and the messages don;t come from untrusted sources.








### Root Cause

- No check for trusted sender/trusted Peer that has been enforced by LayerZero in the _lzReceive function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- An attacker can craft malicious payloads that's similar and perform functions that were meant to be initiated by the original peer/trusted chain set by the user. 


### Impact

- Malicious payloads enterimg the protocol through _lzReceive potentially causing problems.

### PoC

- 

### Mitigation

Add a  **_getPeerORevert functionality** similar to **OAppReceiver.sol::_lzReceive**
