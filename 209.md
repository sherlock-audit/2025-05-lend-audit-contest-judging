# Reentrancy Vulnerability in CoreRouter::redeem Function

## Description
The redeem function in [CoreRouter.sol](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code%202.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. After calling the external redeem function on the lToken contract, it immediately transfers underlying tokens to the user before updating the user's investment state in storage. If the underlying token is a malicious contract, it could re-enter the redeem function (or other state-changing functions) and manipulate the contract's state, potentially draining funds or corrupting accounting.

## Impact
High: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, drain the contract, or corrupt user balances.
The risk is especially severe if the underlying token is a non-standard or malicious ERC20 that calls back into the contract during transfer.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
Suppose an attacker creates a malicious ERC20 token with a transfer function that calls back into the redeem function. The attacker could:

Call redeem to withdraw their lTokens.
During the IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying) call, the malicious token's transfer function triggers another call to redeem before the user's investment is updated.
This allows the attacker to redeem more tokens than they actually own, draining the contract.

See Vulnerable code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124
Relevant code:
```solidity
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

// Transfer underlying tokens to the user
// @audit - HIGH reentrancy in redeem function 
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

// Update total investment
lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
uint256 newInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) - _amount;
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, newInvestment);
```
following is the Proof of code(

## Mitigation
Update all internal state before making any external calls.
Move the transfer of underlying tokens after updating the user's investment and storage state.
Alternatively, use a [reentrancy guard](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code%202.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) modifier to prevent reentrant calls.
