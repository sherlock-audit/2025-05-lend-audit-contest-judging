# Inaccurate User Accounting Due to Stale Exchange Rate in `supply()` Function

### Summary
The[ `CoreRouter::supply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74-L88) function calculates the number of lTokens minted for a user by fetching the `exchangeRateStored()` before calling `mint()`, which internally calls `accrueInterest()` and updates the exchange rate.
This results in a discrepancy between the actual number of lTokens minted and the protocol’s internal record of the user’s total investment — leading to inaccurate accounting for legitimate users.

### Root cause
The protocol captures a value dependent on mutable on-chain state `exchangeRateStored()` before executing an operation `mint()` that mutates that state via `accrueInterest()`.
As a result, the cached exchange rate used for calculating minted tokens becomes stale immediately after minting, causing the recorded mintTokens value to diverge from the actual amount minted.
```javascript
//CoreRouter.sol
   function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");

        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
 
        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);

        // cached exchange rate
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored(); <@ //stale rate

        // Mint lTokens, internally calls accureInterest()
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed"); <@ //updated rate

        //calculated using cached outdated exchange rate
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore; <@ //(_amount * 1e18) / stale rate 

        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);

        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens <@ //incorrect token amount
        );

        ... 
   }

```

### Attack Path
- A user calls `supply(1000, DAI)`.

- The function fetches the current `exchangeRateStored()` — for example, `2e18` — and stores it in exchangeRateBefore.

- The function then calls `mint(1000)` on the lToken contract.

- Inside `mint()`, `accrueInterest()` is triggered, increasing the exchange rate — for example, to `2.5e18`.

- lTokens are minted using the new, higher exchange rate:
```javascript
actualMinted = (1000 * 1e18) / 2.5e18 = 400 lTokens
```

- Back in `supply()`, the protocol uses the old, lower `exchangeRateBefore` (`2e18`) to calculate:
```javascript
mintTokens = (1000 * 1e18) / 2e18 = 500 lTokens
```
- The protocol records `500` lTokens as the user's total investment, while only `400` lTokens were actually minted and assigned to the contract’s balance.

- This results in an internal accounting mismatch, disadvantaging legitimate users in future reward calculations, borrowing limits, or redemptions.

### Impact
Users may receive lesser minted lTokens than protocol records claim, or protocol records might be inflated, undermining internal accounting accuracy


### Recommendation
1. Consider calling `accrueInterest()` before calling `exchangeRateStored()` 
2. Or use `exchangeRateCurrent()`  instead of `exchangeRateStored()` since `exchangeRateCurrent()` internally calls `accrueInterest()`.
