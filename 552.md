# Broken Logic In Same Chain BorrowFunctionality leads to anyone borrowing any amount without paying for that

### Summary

In the `CoreRouter::borrow()`

```solidity

    /**
     * @notice Borrows tokens using supplied collateral
     * @param _amount Amount of tokens to borrow
     * @param _token Address of the token to borrow
     */
    function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

        // Enter the Compound market
        enterMarkets(_lToken);

        // Borrow tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

        // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);  //@audit No boolean check

        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, msg.sender);

        // Update records
        if (currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0) {
            uint256 _newPrinciple =
                (currentBorrow.amount * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex;

            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                msg.sender, _lToken, _newPrinciple + _amount, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken, _amount, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()); //@audit same bug, borrowIndex() changes after accrue() and we are updating it to the cached index
        }

        lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

        // Emit BorrowSuccess event
        emit BorrowSuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken).amount);
    }
```


as we can see, we are not taking any collateral from the user first before executing the underlying borrow functionality . We are borrowing the amount specified by the user and giving them their lTokens which would turn catastrophic for the protocol.

No collateral is taken by the borrower.

Anyone can borrow whatever amount they specify and run away with funds from the protocol.


### Root Cause

- Protocol doesn't take funds from the user first , and sends back lTokens to the user after the underlying Lerc20.borrow operation.
- Broken logic in Borrow functionality.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- None, it's a broken functionality.

### Impact

- Massive loss of funds for the protocol.
- Anyone can borrow maximum amount without providing any collateral.
- Core borrow functionality broken.
-  High severity as the protocol losses all their funds.

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

- Fix the logic and transfer funds from the borrower before performing underlying borrow operations.
