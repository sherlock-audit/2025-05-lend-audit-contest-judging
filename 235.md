# LZ _send() fee fulfilled with a whole contract balance leads to DoS

### Summary

Layer Zero ask for fee to deliver msg to the destination chain. Meanwhile leftovers will be return back to the caller, it won't happens within same tx as it asynchronous process. Hence, every subsequent cross-chain txs initiated from CrossChainRouter will be reverted as it has no balance to pay for fee because it's balance wasn't refunded yet after previous one.  
```solidity
_lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
```
As we can see here, message fee being paid with whole native tokens balance of the router

### Root Cause

CrossChainRouter.sol
```solidity
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

will happens itself in case of tangible borrowing/lending activity
In my understanding enough 2 txs in the block for 2nd to revert, hence, borrowing, lendings tx will block liquidations one as it included in block first

### Impact

DoS of any borrowing, lending, liquidation

### PoC

### Mitigation
