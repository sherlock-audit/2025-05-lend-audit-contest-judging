# Supplier will miss immediate rewards, impacting their earned LEND balance

### Summary

In the supply function, `distributeSupplierLend` is called before updating the user’s `totalInvestment` to include newly minted `lTokens`. Because reward calculations use the old balance snapshot, the fresh deposit earns **no LEND** until the next interaction, under-crediting suppliers and skewing reward metrics.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);
        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");
        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");
        // Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);
        // Get exchange rate before mint
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        @> lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
        // Update total investment using calculated mintTokens
        @> lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
        );
        emit SupplySuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, _amount, mintTokens);
    }
```

The supplier’s position is updated in two steps: (1) `rewards distribution` and then (2) `totalInvestment` increment. By distributing first, the reward calculation reads an outdated balance that excludes the current deposit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Minting: User deposits `_amount`, mints `mintTokens`.
2. Distribute: Protocol distributes LEND based on `oldBalance` (pre-mint), ignoring the new `mintTokens`.
3. Update Balance: Only afterward does `totalInvestment` include `mintTokens`, but distribution has passed.
4. Effect: The deposit never accrues rewards for the blocks between supply and the next distribution call.

### Impact

- **Under-Distribution of LEND**: Suppliers lose out on rewards proportional to their new deposit.
- **Inconsistent Reward Metrics**: Off-chain analytics will under-report user earnings and distort APR calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder state updates so that `totalInvestment` is increased before calling `distributeSupplierLend`. That way, the fresh balance is used in the reward calculation, ensuring immediate and accurate LEND accrual.
