# User can lose his fund when using `layerZero` message

### Summary

When `borrowCrossChain`, user sends ether for messaging fee but he can't quote messaging fee and he can't receive excess ether.

### Root Cause

- `CrossChainRouter` doesn't have quote function that users can get messaging fee amount.
- [`_send`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L804-L821) used `address(this).balance` for messaging fee and refund address is address(this), not msg.sender.
