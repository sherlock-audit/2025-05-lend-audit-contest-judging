## Summary
In the CrossChainRouter contract, the `_checkLiquidationValid` function incorrectly uses the collateral seize amount as a parameter when checking if an account is eligible for liquidation. This means the validation is checking a hypothetical state rather than the actual current state, potentially allowing liquidations of accounts that are actually solvent.

## Root Cause
In the [_checkLiquidationValid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-Sparrow-23/blob/471749b3043a3eca36d78e6d1b3a77aef72a536e/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431-L436) function, the code incorrectly passes `payload.amount` (which represents the seize amount) to the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function:

```solidity
function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );
    return borrowed > collateral;
}
```

When validating if an account is eligible for liquidation, the function should check the current state of the account without any hypothetical modifications, but by passing `payload.amount` as the last parameter, it's checking a hypothetical state after some amount has already been seized.

## Internal pre-conditions
1. A user must have a cross-chain borrow position (collateral on Chain A, debt on Chain B)
2. The user's position must be near the liquidation threshold
3. A liquidator must attempt to liquidate the position via liquidateCrossChain

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User supplies collateral on Chain A and borrows on Chain B
2. User's position is still solvent but close to the liquidation threshold
3. Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain on Chain B with a valid repay amount
4. The liquidation validation function `_checkLiquidationValid` is called
5. The function incorrectly uses payload.amount (seize amount) when calculating account liquidity
6. This artificially reduces the user's collateral in the hypothetical calculation
7. As a result, the function returns that the account is underwater when it's actually not
8. The liquidation proceeds against a solvent account

## Impact
This bug allows liquidations of accounts that should not be eligible for liquidation, resulting in unfair seizure of user collateral. This leads to:

1. Users losing collateral when their positions are actually healthy
2. Violation of the core promise of the protocol that positions above the liquidation threshold are safe
3. Loss of user trust in the protocol
4. Potential for exploitative liquidations targeting accounts near the threshold

## Mitigation
Modify the `_checkLiquidationValid` function to correctly check the current state without hypothetical modifications
