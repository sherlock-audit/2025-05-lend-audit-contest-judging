# Cross-Chain Repayment Accounting Error

### Summary

Incorrect storage update logic causes accounting inconsistencies that deny users their rightful borrowing capacity. When users repay cross-chain debt, the protocol creates phantom same-chain debt records while correctly updating cross-chain debt, resulting in double-counted debt that blocks legitimate borrowing operations.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L493-L500) the `repayBorrowInternal()` function ignores the `_isSameChain` parameter when updating debt storage, always updating same-chain debt records (`borrowBalance` mapping) even when repaying cross-chain debt that should update cross-chain storage (`crossChainCollaterals` mapping).

```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(address borrower, address liquidator, uint256 _amount, address _lToken, bool _isSameChain) internal {
    // ✅ CORRECT: Uses flag to read right debt amount
    if (_isSameChain) {
        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken); // Cross-chain debt
    }
    
    // ... token transfers and compound repayment work correctly ...
    
    // ❌ BUG: ALWAYS updates same-chain storage regardless of _isSameChain flag
    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);        // ← Should be conditional
        lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(                           // ← Should be conditional  
            borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
        );
    }
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have existing cross-chain debt recorded in `crossChainCollaterals[borrower][underlying]` mapping
2. User needs to have tokens to repay the cross-chain debt
3. CrossChainRouter needs to be properly authorized to call CoreRouter

### External Pre-conditions

None required - this is a pure logic error in debt accounting.

### Attack Path

1. User creates cross-chain debt by calling `borrowCrossChain()` from Chain A to Chain B, establishing debt record in `crossChainCollaterals[user][tokenB]` on Chain B
2. User calls `repayCrossChainBorrow(user, amount, lTokenB, chainA_eid)` on Chain B to repay the debt
3. Function reads cross-chain debt correctly from `crossChainCollaterals` via `borrowWithInterest()`
4. Function repays tokens to Compound protocol successfully  
5. **BUG**: Function updates wrong storage - modifies `borrowBalance[user][lTokenB]` (same-chain storage) instead of only updating `crossChainCollaterals[user][tokenB]` (cross-chain storage)
6. Cross-chain debt record is properly reduced in `crossChainCollaterals[user][tokenB]`
7. Same-chain storage gets corrupted with phantom debt values since no same-chain debt should exist
8. Protocol now double-counts debt: real cross-chain debt + phantom same-chain debt
9. User's borrowing capacity is incorrectly restricted due to inflated total debt calculation
10. Legitimate borrowing operations are denied even when user has sufficient collateral

### Impact

The protocol creates phantom debt records that incorrectly restrict user borrowing capacity and deny access to legitimate lending operations. When users repay cross-chain debt, the bug creates phantom same-chain debt equal to the repayment amount, causing the protocol to double-count user debt. This results in users losing access to their rightful borrowing capacity, as the protocol calculates total debt as the sum of real cross-chain debt plus phantom same-chain debt. The impact includes degraded user experience where legitimate borrows are rejected, potential user fund lockup where collateral cannot be fully utilized, and systematic denial of service for users who have repaid cross-chain debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `repayBorrowInternal()` to conditionally update the correct storage based on the `_isSameChain` parameter
