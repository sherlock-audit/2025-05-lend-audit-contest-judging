# Stale exchange rate snapshot enables interest front running

### Summary

Both `supply` and `redeem` in `CoreRouter.sol` snapshot the cToken’s exchange rate before calling `mint`/`redeem` and then use that stale rate to calculate user balances. An attacker can induce a large interest accrual in the same block (e.g. by triggering a borrow), then immediately call `supply` or `redeem` and have their lToken mint/redeem calculated against the lower pre-accrual rate, siphoning value from honest suppliers.

### Root Cause

Instead of using the on-chain-updated exchange rate after minting/redeeming, the router:

1. Reads `exchangeRateStored()` once at entry.
2. Calls mint or redeem (which itself accrues interest and updates the rate).
3. Still divides by the old snapshot, not the updated rate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

- A mechanism to trigger a meaningful interest accrual in the same block (e.g. someone else’s borrow or repay on the same market).
- Block-level transaction ordering control by the attacker (standard MEV/time-priority front-running).


### Attack Path

1. Normal state where cToken exchange rate = R₀.
2. Attacker monitors mempool for a large borrow that will accrue interest (raise rate to R₁ > R₀).
3. Miner/attacker includes that borrow first; exchange rate updates to R₁.
4. In the same block, attacker calls `CoreRouter.supply(amount, token)`.

- Router read rate = R₀.
- `mint(amount)` uses updated rate internally, minting fewer lTokens (≈ amount / R₁).
- Router calculates minted lTokens = `amount / R₀` (too many), crediting attacker extra shares.
5. Attacker later redeems those extra shares at true rate R₁, extracting the overage.
6. Repeat indefinitely to drain value. 

### Impact

Value leakage from honest suppliers into attacker hands. It can be replayed indefinitely so long as block-level ordering is available.
