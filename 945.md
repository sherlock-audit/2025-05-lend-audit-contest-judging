# Stale exchange rate calculation during redeem() would lead to user getting less amount of tokens

### Summary

The smart contract's redeem() function is vulnerable to an accounting inconsistency caused by stale exchange rate data. Specifically, the function calculates exchangeRateBefore by calling a local exchangeRate(_lToken) view function before initiating the actual redemption through LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount). However, the underlying lToken's redeem() implementation—typically modeled after protocols like Compound—internally calls accrueInterest() to update interest-bearing state variables before executing the redemption. This discrepancy leads to a situation where the exchangeRateBefore used for calculating expectedUnderlying is based on outdated interest data, while the actual underlying amount transferred to the user is based on a fresher, higher exchange rate after interest accrual.

As a result, the expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18 computation underestimates the actual underlying tokens redeemed and transferred to the user. If the system uses this expectedUnderlying value for internal balance tracking, user state updates, reward logic, or invariant assertions, it creates an imbalance between on-chain asset movements and recorded accounting. This can lead to under-crediting the user or introducing inconsistencies in the protocol’s accounting model.

### Attack Path

As mentioned in summary

### Impact

This vulnerability undermines the accuracy of the system’s internal accounting and can cause users to be under-credited during redemption. In cases where the expectedUnderlying is used to update user balances, determine reward entitlements, or emit critical off-chain events, this stale value misrepresents the actual amount of underlying assets received by the user. Over time, repeated redemptions under such a condition can skew the system’s total supply calculations and introduce state drift. Additionally, this discrepancy can affect integrations, such as frontend displays or indexers relying on emitted data, and may create avenues for financial loss or protocol manipulation in more complex interactions where accurate exchange rate computation is a prerequisite for safety.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To ensure accurate and up-to-date exchange rate usage, the protocol should explicitly accrue interest before calculating the exchange rate used in any financial computation within the redeem() function. This can be achieved by invoking accrueInterest() directly on the lToken prior to reading the exchange rate, or by using an interface function like exchangeRateCurrent() if provided by the lending protocol, which implicitly accrues interest before returning the latest exchange rate. This guarantees consistency between the calculated expectedUnderlying and the actual token flows during redemption. Additionally, any critical computations involving exchange rates in other areas of the contract should follow this same pattern to prevent similar accounting mismatches elsewhere in the protocol.
