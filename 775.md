# Incorrect liquidity checks in `redeem()` due to usage of stale index

### Summary

Liquidity checks performed during redeem is based on `stale index` as the function fails to first accrue interest. This potentially allows for excessive redeems which should otherwise be prevented.


### Root Cause

During redeem the following [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L109-L112) is done:
```solidity
        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");
```
As seen, the funtion aims to prevent users from taking out so much collateral that can possibly leave their positions undecollateralized. Now, the [`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L425-L428) that calculates the `borrowed` and `collateral` does this based on current borrow index. However, the redeem function fails to accrue interest prior allowing these calculation to be done based on stale index.

As such, the returned values potentially could reflect incorrect state of the position allowing for incorrect redemptions which downstream exposes the user to liquidation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have an open borrow position.
2. Interest must have accrued since the last `borrowIndex` update.


### External Pre-conditions

1. User attempts to redeem collateral.

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `redeem()` function
2. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is called to validate redemption safety
3. Function uses outdated borrowIndex from the last accrual event
4. Borrowed amounts are calculated using stale index, underestimating actual debt
5. Protocol allows redemptions that should be restricted based on current debt levels


### Impact

Users potentially make excess redemptions exposing their positions to underwater state hence liquidation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call `accrueInterest()` at the start of `redeem()`
```diff
    function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
+       LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
    }
```
