# Unsafe Accrued LEND Calculation in `distributeBorrowerLend()` Leads to Incorrect Reward Distribution Due to Double Division by Borrow Index

### Summary

The `distributeBorrowerLend()` function in `LendStorage.sol` is responsible for calculating and crediting LEND token rewards to borrowers. A critical miscalculation occurs when determining the `borrowerAmount`. This amount is derived by summing the results of `borrowWithInterest()` and `borrowWithInterestSame()` and then incorrectly dividing this sum by the current `LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()`. Since `borrowWithInterest()` and `borrowWithInterestSame()` already return the current, interest-accrued borrow balances, this subsequent division by the borrow index deflates the base amount used for LEND reward calculation. This leads to borrowers receiving significantly fewer LEND tokens than they are rightfully owed.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in an incorrect understanding or application of how borrow balances and borrow indexes interact.

1.  **Interest-Accrued Values:** The functions `borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken)` and `borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)` are designed to return the borrower's total outstanding debt for a given `lToken`, *including* accrued interest. This means their return values already represent the current, up-to-date borrowed amounts in terms of the underlying asset.

2.  **Erroneous Normalization/Division:** The code then calculates `borrowerAmount` as:    
     ```solidity
    uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
        add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
        Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()}) // Erroneous division
    );
    ```
    The sum `add_(borrowWithInterest(...), borrowWithInterestSame(...))` correctly represents the total current borrowed principal (in terms of the underlying token, having already been scaled by previous borrow index applications internally to those functions or by the nature of how balances are stored). Dividing this sum *again* by the current `borrowIndex` (which is a factor representing cumulative interest, e.g., 1.1 means 10% interest accrued) effectively "discounts" the principal amount.

3.  **LEND Reward Calculation Basis:** The LEND rewards are calculated as `borrowerDelta = mul_(borrowerAmount, deltaIndex)`. Since `borrowerAmount` is artificially reduced by the erroneous division, the `borrowerDelta` (accrued LEND for the period) and consequently the total `lendAccrued[borrower]` will be proportionally smaller than they should be.


Essentially, the `borrowerAmount` should represent the actual quantity of tokens borrowed, upon which LEND rewards are based. The current calculation incorrectly divides this quantity, leading to under-rewarding.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* The vulnerable code path is executed within the `distributeBorrowerLend()` function in `LendStorage.sol`.
* The calculation of `borrowerAmount` is the specific point of failure.
* The value of `LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()` must be greater than 1 (or its scaled equivalent, e.g., > 1e18) for the division to have a reductive effect. Since borrow indexes typically grow over time to reflect accrued interest, this condition will almost always be met after market inception.

### External Pre-conditions

* A user must have an active borrow position in an `lToken` market that offers LEND rewards for borrowers.
* The `distributeBorrowerLend()` function must be called for this borrower and `lToken`. This typically happens during LEND claim operations or other critical interactions like repaying a borrow.

### Attack Path

`Logical Issue` so the bug will be in simply calling the function. 

### Impact

* **Financial Loss for Borrowers:** Borrowers will receive fewer LEND tokens than they are entitled to. This directly translates to a quantifiable financial loss for users of the platform, as LEND tokens have monetary value. The longer the issue persists and the higher the borrow index grows, the more significant the under-rewarding becomes.
* **Compromised Incentive Mechanism:** The LEND distribution is a core incentive for users to borrow assets on the platform. An incorrect reward calculation undermines this mechanism, potentially discouraging borrowing activity and reducing the protocol's utility and competitiveness.

* **Widespread Effect on Critical Functions:** The `distributeBorrowerLend()` function is invoked by several critical functions across different contracts, magnifying the impact of this bug:
    * **In `CoreRouter.sol`:**
        * `repayBorrowInternal`: When users repay their borrows, reward calculations might be triggered, leading to incorrect accrual at a crucial interaction point.
        * `claimLend`: This is the primary function for users to claim their accrued LEND. The error directly results in users claiming less than their due.
    * **In `CrossChainRouter.sol` (if applicable to the broader system):**
        * `_updateRepaymentState`
        * `_handleDestRepayMessage`
        * `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`
        These cross-chain functionalities, if they rely on `distributeBorrowerLend`, will propagate the incorrect reward calculations, potentially affecting users interacting with the protocol across different chains.

Given the direct financial impact on users and the compromise of a core protocol mechanism affecting multiple critical functions, this issue requires immediate attention.

### Explanation of POC:
1. **Setup:** 
   - Borrow index starts at 1.2e18 (simulating 20% interest growth)
   - Current borrow index is 1.3e18 (simulating additional 10% growth)
   - Borrower has 1000 + 500 = 1500 tokens borrowed (interest-adjusted)

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   ```solidity
   borrowerAmount = (1000e18 + 500e18) / 1.2e18 = 1250e18
   borrowerDelta = 1250e18 * (1.3e18 - 1.2e18) = 125e18
   ```

3. **Correct Calculation:**
   ```solidity
   borrowerAmount = 1000e18 + 500e18 = 1500e18
   borrowerDelta = 1500e18 * (1.3e18 - 1.2e18) = 150e18
   ```

4. **Result:**
   - Incorrect rewards: 125 LEND
   - Correct rewards: 150 LEND
   - Discrepancy: 25 LEND (20% under-reward)



### Mitigation

Remove the division by the borrow index in the `borrowerAmount` calculation:

```diff
- uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
-    add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
-    Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
- );

+ uint256 borrowerAmount = add_(
+    borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken),
+    borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)
+ );
```
