### Title: Lendtroller::grantLendInternal can fail silently due to lack of transfer return check

Description:
Here is the function: 

```solidity
    function grantLendInternal(address user, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        Lend lend = Lend(getLendAddress());
        uint256 lendRemaining = lend.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= lendRemaining) {
            lend.transfer(user, amount);
            return 0;
        }
        return amount;
    }
```

In the grantLendInternal function, the contract just calls lend.transfer(user, amount) without checking if it actually worked. Some tokens (like USDT related tokens) don’t return anything or might fail silently. But the code keeps going like nothing happened.

So even if the transfer didn’t go through, the contract acts like it did and resets the user's rewards to 0.

Impact:

User thinks they got their LEND rewards, but they didn’t. The system thinks it sent it, but no tokens moved. Rewards get lost and can’t be claimed again. This breaks user trust and messes up reward logic. Happens quietly so users won’t even know why rewards gone.



PoC:

1. User interacts with the protocol and earns LEND rewards.


2. User calls claimLend() to get those rewards.


3. grantLendInternal runs and calls lend.transfer(user, amount) with no return check.


4. If the token fails silently (like USDT-style), the transfer doesn’t go through.


5. But the contract still resets lendAccrued[user] = 0.


6. User gets nothing but can’t claim again — reward is gone.

Recommended mitigation: 

Add a check to make sure the transfer really worked:

```solidity
require(lend.transfer(user, amount), "LEND transfer failed");
```
