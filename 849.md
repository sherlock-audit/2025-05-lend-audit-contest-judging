# Missing use of SafeERC20 in redeem(...) allows failed transfer

### Summary

We should use safeTransfer instead of transfer.

### Root Cause

Using IERC20.transfer in the CoreRouter.[redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124) function will cause a loss of funds for end users when the underlying token (e.g., USDC) reverts or returns no value on transfer. Because of the nature of USDC can revert silently, yet the contract continues and updates the user’s internal balance anyway. As a result, the user’s on-chain state is decremented while their actual tokens are never delivered.

```solidity
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
