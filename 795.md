# Multiple reward claims in `claimLend` function

## Summary
The ability to include the same address multiple times in the `holders` array and the failure to reset `lendAccrued` after transferring LEND tokens in the `claimLend` function will cause the protocol to distribute excess LEND rewards.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol` within the `claimLend` function, the `holders` array is iterated without checking for duplicate addresses. Additionally, `lendAccrued` is not reset to zero after a successful transfer in `grantLendInternal`, enabling repeated claims of the same rewards.

[CoreRouter.claimLend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L370-L370)

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The user needs to have a non-zero `lendAccrued` balance (e.g., from prior supplier or borrower activity).
2. The contract needs to have a sufficient LEND token balance to process excess claims.
3. The user needs to include their address multiple times in the `holders` array or repeatedly call `claimLend`.
4. The lToken pools need to have non-zero `lendSupplySpeeds` or `lendBorrowSpeeds` to generate rewards.

## Attack Path
1. A user with 100 LEND in `lendAccrued` for cUSDC calls `claimLend` with `holders = [user, user]` and `lTokens = [cUSDC]`, setting `suppliers = true`.
2. The function iterates over `holders`.
3. The function checks `lendAccrued[user] = 100 LEND` and calls `grantLendInternal(user, 100)`, transferring 100 LEND to the user.
4. `lendAccrued[user]` remains 100 LEND, as it is not reset.
5. The user calls `claimLend` again with `holders = [user]` and `lTokens = [cUSDC]`, claiming another 100 LEND, as long as the contract has sufficient LEND balance.
6. The protocol loses 100 LEND beyond the intended 100 LEND.

## Impact
The protocol suffers a financial loss by distributing excess LEND tokens. The core reward distribution functionality is broken, risking user trust and protocol activity. Repeated claims could exhaust the LEND balance, halting reward distribution entirely.
