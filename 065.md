# Cross-Chain Borrow Accounting Bypass Allows Unlimited Borrowing

### Summary

An impossible condition in LendStorage::borrowWithInterest() will cause unlimited borrowing for users as the protocol will fail to account for cross-chain borrows when calculating user debt.



### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497-L500

In LendStorage::borrowWithInterest() , the condition
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
```

is impossible to satisfy for legitimate cross-chain borrows where source and destination chains are different.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to supply collateral on Chain A to have borrowing power
2. Liquidity needs to exist on Chain B for the user to borrow against

### External Pre-conditions

The protocol must be deployed on at least two different chains with different endpoint IDs 

### Attack Path


1. **Alice supplies 100,000 USDC as collateral on Ethereum (Chain A)** - This gives her 75,000 USDC borrowing power (75% collateral factor)

2. **Alice calls CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain() on Ethereum to borrow 75,000 USDC from Base** - The function sends a LayerZero message to Base

3. **Base processes the borrow request and creates a cross-chain collateral record** with:
   -  srcEid = 1 (Ethereum)
   -  destEid = 42161 (Base)
   -  principle = 75,000 USDC

4. **When Base calculates Alice's borrowed amount via LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()() **, the function checks:
  
 ```solidity
   if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
   ```
   This evaluates to: if (42161 == 42161 && 1 == 42161) = false
   
   Therefore, the 75,000 USDC borrow is not counted.

5. **Alice calls CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain() again on Base to borrow another 75,000 USDC** - Since LendStorage::borrowWithInterest() returns 0, the protocol thinks Alice has no existing borrows

6. **The second borrow succeeds** - Alice now has 150,000 USDC borrowed against 100,000 USDC collateral

### Impact

The protocol suffers insolvency as users can borrow unlimited amounts exceeding their collateral value. In the example above, Alice borrows 150% of her collateral value, but she could continue borrowing indefinitely since her cross-chain borrows are never counted. This leads to:
- Direct financial loss for liquidity providers when borrowers default
- Protocol insolvency as total borrows exceed total collateral
- Complete breakdown of the risk management system

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the condition in LendStorage::borrowWithInterest() to properly account for cross-chain borrows:

```solidity
// Count all cross-chain collaterals where this chain is the destination
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid) {
    borrowedAmount += (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
}
```
