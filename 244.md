# Wrong Input Parameter Causes Healthy Positions to be Falsely Liquidated in Cross-Chain Liquidation

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidation, `_checkLiquidationValid()` incorrectly passes the repay amount as the borrow amount to `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. Since no new borrowing occurs during liquidation, this causes most positions to appear falsely liquidatable.

### Root Cause

The `borrowAmount` parameter in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is intended to simulate additional borrowing to check if the account remains solvent. However, during liquidation, no new borrowing happens, but the repay amount is incorrectly passed as `borrowAmount`. This inflates the calculated borrow balance and triggers false liquidation conditions. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L433). It inputs `payload.amount` as `borrowAmount`.

### Attack Path

A malicious liquidator can exploit this issue by triggering cross-chain liquidations on positions that are actually healthy and not eligible for liquidation. Because the repay amount is mistakenly treated as additional borrowing in the liquidity check, the system falsely identifies these positions as underwater. This allows the attacker to liquidate and seize collateral unfairly.

### Impact

Legitimate borrower positions can be wrongly liquidated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `_checkLiquidationValid()` to pass 0 as the `borrowAmount` when calling `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`, ensuring the liquidation check reflects the true borrow balance without simulating new borrow.
