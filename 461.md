# Misuse of getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() Causes Inconsistent Lending Logic Across Core Functions

### Summary

The function incorrectly adds the value of tokens being redeemed to the borrow amount instead of subtracting it from the collateral. This causes the protocol to overestimate the borrower’s risk, potentially blocking legitimate redeem actions and causing incorrect liquidation decisions. While it doesn’t allow direct theft, it significantly impacts risk calculations, making it a high-severity issue.

### Root Cause

```solidity
   function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        address account,
        LToken lTokenModify,
        uint256 redeemTokens,
        uint256 borrowAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        // Handle effects of current action
        if (address(lTokenModify) != address(0)) {
            vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(lTokenModify);
            vars.oraclePrice = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissa});

            // Add effect of redeeming collateral
@>       if (redeemTokens > 0) {
                vars.collateralFactor = Exp({
                    mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).getCollateralFactorMantissa(address(lTokenModify))
                });
                vars.exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: lTokenModify.exchangeRateStored()});
                vars.tokensToDenom = mul_(mul_(vars.collateralFactor, vars.exchangeRate), vars.oraclePrice);
@>          vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects =
                   mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.tokensToDenom, redeemTokens, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects); //@audit-issue should subtract from var.sumCollateral instead
            }

            // Add effect of new borrow
@>       if (borrowAmount > 0) {
@>             vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects =
                    mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, borrowAmount, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);
            }
        }

        return (vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects, vars.sumCollateral);
    }

```

In [LendStorage.sol:456](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L456), the function` getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` incorrectly adds the value of tokens being redeemed to `sumBorrowPlusEffects` instead of subtracting it from `sumCollateral`, which results in an inflated borrow value and under-reported collateral value.

### Attack Path

1. A user with valid collateral calls `redeem()` to withdraw a portion of their collateral.

2. The protocol internally calls `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` to validate the action.

3. Due to the bug, the redeem amount is added to `sumBorrowPlusEffects` rather than reducing from `sumCollateral`.

4. This incorrectly indicates that the user has less collateral or more borrow, failing the liquidity check.

5. The protocol blocks the `redeem()` call, even though the user is legitimately healthy.

6. A liquidator later calls `liquidateBorrow()` on this user.

7. The same faulty logic falsely flags the user as undercollateralized.

8. The liquidator proceeds to unfairly liquidate the user's position, even if their position should be healthy.

### Impact

* Users are blocked from redeeming their collateral even when overcollateralized.

* Users may be falsely liquidated, losing assets due to inaccurate health factor evaluation.

* Liquidators may gain unfair rewards through forced liquidations on healthy positions.

* The protocol’s risk engine becomes unreliable, which can erode user trust and harm protocol integrity.

### PoC

Replace the incorrect line:

```solidity
vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.tokensToDenom, redeemTokens, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);
```
with the correct logic that subtracts from collateral, not adds to borrow:

```solidity
vars.sumCollateral = sub_(vars.sumCollateral, mul_ScalarTruncate(vars.tokensToDenom, redeemTokens));
```

Additionally, consider adding comprehensive tests to verify correctness of liquidity calculations for both redeem() and liquidateBorrow() logic paths.
