# Cross-Chain Borrow Records Store Inverted srcEid/destEid Values

### Summary

In a borrow struct the:
- srcEid is  The chain ID where the collateral exists (Chain A),
- destEid is The chain ID where you receive the borrowed tokens (Chain B)

The issue is that the`_handleValidBorrowRequest` function on the source chain (Chain A) stores cross-chain borrow records with inverted srcEid and destEid values. When Chain A receives a borrow confirmation message from Chain B, it incorrectly uses the LayerZero message context (where the message came from) instead of the logical transaction context (where collateral exists vs where borrow happened). This creates inconsistent cross-chain records that break debt tracking and liquidation processes.


### Root Cause

in the [`_lzreceive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L769) the `uint32 srcEid = _origin.srcEid; ` is passed to the the handle funcitons this means in our case `_handleValidBorrowRequest` will receive chainB_ID in srcId, later on we do:
```javascript
function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // srcEid = CHAIN_B_EID (where confirmation message came from)
    // currentEid = CHAIN_A_EID (current chain processing the message)
    
    lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
        payload.sender,
        payload.srcToken,
        LendStorage.Borrow(
            srcEid,        // CHAIN_B_EID  Wrong! Should be CHAIN_A_EID
            currentEid,    // CHAIN_A_EID Wrong! Should be CHAIN_B_EID
            payload.amount,
            payload.borrowIndex,
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        )
    );
}
```
According to sponsor definition:

srcEid = The chain ID where the collateral exists (Chain A)
destEid = The chain ID where you receive the borrowed tokens (Chain B)

But the function stores srcEid as Chain B and destEid as Chain A, which is backwards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User must have collateral on Chain A and initiate cross-chain borrow to Chain B


### External Pre-conditions

Both chains must be running and processing transactions


### Attack Path

- An attacker has collateral on chainA and he initiates a crosschain to chainB
- his borrow is stored in chainA under crossChainBorrows but with srcId = chainB
- next time he tries to borrowcrosschain, `borrowCrossChain` will call `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` which will call `borrowWithInterest` to check his debt. the problem is that we will loop over crossChainBorrows with the condition `borrows[i].srcEid == [currentEid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L489), this means the previous borrow won't be taken in consideration and the attacker can overborrow.

### Impact

Users can systematically over-borrow by exploiting the invisible cross-chain debt which will cause protocol insolvency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the _handleValidBorrowRequest function to use logical transaction context instead of message context:
```javascript
function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
        payload.sender,
        payload.srcToken,
        LendStorage.Borrow(
            currentEid,    // ✅ Chain A (where collateral exists)
            srcEid,        // ✅ Chain B (where borrow happened)
            payload.amount,
            payload.borrowIndex,
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        )
    );
}
```
Additionnaly it shouldn't be possible to have crossChainBorrows where srcId isn't currentEid so remove the condition
