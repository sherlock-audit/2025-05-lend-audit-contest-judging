# Cross-Chain Functions Rely on Protocol ETH But Are Not Payable

### Summary

Cross-chain functions `repayCrossChain()` and `liquidateCrossChain()` rely on the protocol’s ETH balance to pay LayerZero message fees. However, these functions are not payable. This creates an imbalance where users can initiate cross-chain operations at no personal cost, potentially draining protocol ETH.

### Root Cause

 `repayCrossChain()` and `liquidateCrossChain()`  assume the contract will always have sufficient ETH to cover LayerZero message fees but are not marked payable, preventing the contract from receiving ETH during execution.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor calls a cross-chain function (e.g., liquidateCrossChain()) repeatedly without sending any ETH since the function is not payable.

2. The protocol uses its own ETH balance to pay LayerZero message fees for each cross-chain message sent.

3. The attacker crafts inputs or manipulates parameters so that an intermediate on-chain call (e.g., repayment or state update) reverts intentionally due to invalid values.

4. Because the transaction reverts at a later step, none of the critical state changes finalize, but LayerZero messages and their fees were already consumed from the protocol.

5. By repeatedly triggering these failing calls, the attacker drains the protocol’s ETH balance paying for failed cross-chain message fees without advancing any protocol state or repaying debt.

### Impact

The protocol’s ETH balance can be drained by an attacker who repeatedly triggers failing cross-chain operations.
