# Liquidators will receive excess cTokens due to stale exchange rates in liquidations

### Summary

Missing interest accrual for collateral tokens will cause liquidators to receive more lTokens than intended during liquidations, as the exchange rate used in seizeToken calculations is lower when not accounting for accumulated interest.



### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol:liquidateSeizeUpdate()`, the protocol calls [liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L285C9-L286C91) using a stale `exchangeRate` that doesn't include accumulated interest for the collateral token, while it does accrue interest for the borrowed token. This results in more lTokens being seized for the same underlying value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower must have an underwater position eligible for liquidation
2. lTokenCollateral must have accumulated unclaimed interest
3. Liquidator must call liquidateBorrow() to initiate liquidation

### External Pre-conditions

Time must have passed since last interest accrual for the collateral token

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator calls liquidateBorrow() with borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral and borrowedAsset
2. Protocol accrues interest on borrowedlToken but not on lTokenCollateral
3. liquidateSeizeUpdate() calculates seizeTokens using stale exchangeRate
4. Liquidator receives more lTokens than intended

### Impact

The liquidator receives more tokens than they should since the calculation uses a stale exchange rate. While the underlying value remains constant, this creates accounting inaccuracies in the protocol's lToken distribution.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add accrueInterest() call on lTokenCollateral before calculating seizeTokens
