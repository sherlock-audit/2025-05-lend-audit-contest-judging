# A user can drain the contract’s ETH balance by spamming cross-chain borrow requests without supplying any collateral.

### Summary

The protocol allows any user to repeatedly call the `borrowCrossChain` function, which sends LayerZero messages and pays the associated fees from the contract’s ETH balance. Because there is no check for sufficient collateral before sending the message, an attacker can spam requests at minimal cost, draining all ETH from the contract and disrupting cross-chain operations.

### Root Cause

The `borrowCrossChain` function in the `CrossChainRouter `contract does not verify that the user has sufficient collateral before sending a cross-chain borrow request. Internally, it calls `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to retrieve collateral information, but it does not enforce any requirement on the returned value. As a result, a malicious user can call `borrowCrossChain `with zero or insufficient collateral, and the contract will still send a LayerZero message and pay the associated fee from its ETH balance. The `_send `function uses the contract’s ETH balance for the LayerZero messaging fee, and there are no rate limits or per-user restrictions. This allows a malicious user to repeatedly call `borrowCrossChain `(even with zero or invalid borrow amounts), causing the contract to pay LayerZero fees on every call.  Once the ETH balance is drained, legitimate users cannot perform cross-chain operations until the contract is refilled. 
Another aspect of this kind of attack is that whole ETH balance of the contract is sent along with the crosschain call. It means that that the next call should wait for the refund to arrive in order to be successful. The above described attack can also be done by frontrunning any call to the `CrossChainRouter ` contract that aims to send a crosschain message and lead to DOS.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract holds an ETH balance to pay LayerZero messaging fees.

### External Pre-conditions

The protocol is deployed on a chain with low gas fees.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes that the contract holds ETH for LayerZero fees(Ideally on a chain where gas cost for the attacker is cheap, target chain could be ETH mainnet where gas cost is higher, considering the LayerZero  message will also charge the current contract for the gas fees on target chain ).
2. Attacker scripts or automates repeated calls to `borrowCrossChain`, each time triggering a LayerZero message and consuming ETH, even with zero or insufficient collateral.
3. The contract pays the messaging fee on every call, rapidly depleting its ETH balance.
4. Once the balance is drained, all cross-chain operations fail for legitimate users until the contract is refilled.

### Impact

The contract’s ETH balance can be fully drained, preventing other users from performing cross-chain operations. The protocol may become unresponsive or require manual intervention to restore functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a collateral check in `borrowCrossChain `to ensure the user has sufficient collateral before sending a cross-chain message.
- Implement rate limiting or per-user restrictions to prevent abuse.
- Require a minimum borrow amount or enforce a minimum fee per message.
- Consider charging users for the actual LayerZero fee via `msg.value` instead of using the contract’s balance.
