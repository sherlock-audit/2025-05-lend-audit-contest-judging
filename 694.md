# User will be able to re-use same collateral for loans across multiple chains

### Summary

Missing lock on collateral used to back cross-chain debt will cause losses for the protocol as users will be able to re-use the same collateral to take debt on multiple chains.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` on line [138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L138), the current debt value is ignored. This means that if the collateral has been used to take out loans on chains other than the target chain the resulting debt is ignored. When the message is received on the target chain, the protocol only considers debt registered on the current chain on lines [617-622](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617-L622). 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to deploy the protocol on at least 3 chains.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls `CoreRouter::supply` on Chain A.
2. User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` on Chain A with destination as Chain B, and with maximum borrowable amount. The cross-chain workflow completes successfully.
3. User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` on Chain A with destination as Chain C. They can use the same borrow amount as in the previous step. The workflow completes and they now have the borrowed funds on Chains B and C.

### Impact

The protocol can become insolvent as the attack is repeatable many times. The user profits by gaining borrowed assets of higher total value that their initial collateral.
