# Possible inflation attack in CoreRouter

### Summary

Malicious user can mint 1 wei worth of `LToken` and then proceed with the following attack:
1. Track the mempool for other call of the [`CoreRouter::supply`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61) function
2. Frontrun this transaction by transferring the corresponding underlying asset to the `LToken`, which will be accounted from `LToken::exchangeRateStoredInternal` function, which will inflate the exchange rate, leading to shares of the corresponding user being round down to 0
3. Then the malicious user will just redeem his 1 share, which will result in him getting the funds he transferred in + the funds the other user transferred in, making him profit

This flow can be tracked right here:
`CoreRouter::supply => LERC20::mint => LToken::mintInternal => LToken::mintFresh => LToken::exchangeRateStoredInternal`

### Root Cause

The usage of `getCashPrior` function in `LToken` contract, when the totalSupply of `LToken` is not 0

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. Normal user deposits thinking he will be the first depositor
2. Malicious user frontruns him by minting 1 wei shares and then transferring the needed funds to the `LToken` contract

### Attack Path

1. User makes his deposit
2. Other user sees his tx in the mempool and calls `CoreRouter::supply` function to mint 1 wei worth of `LToken`, then transfers big amount of funds (Can e obtained because of a big borrow of other platform for example) to the `LToken` contract which will inflate the exchange rate because of the way `getCashPrior()` function works (just returns the balance of the tokens in the corresponding contract):
```solidity
   function getCashPrior() internal view virtual override returns (uint256) {
        EIP20Interface token = EIP20Interface(underlying);
        return token.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
3. After the attack is successful the malicious user just redeems the shares and goes off with the profit

### Impact

User can steal other users' funds by performing the attack

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

mint some bonus tokens on the first call of `CoreRouter::supply` function to ensure that this attack is not possible to perform
