# `LendStorage`.`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` didn't update every index of `borrowedAssets`

### Summary

In `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, `borrowWithInterestSame` and `borrowWithInterest` are used for calculating amount of borrowed tokens, but these functions used `lToken.borrowIndex`.
But `borrowIndex` is old index that is not updated for current time.

### Root Cause

`LendStorage`.`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`  used  `borrowWithInterestSame` and `borrowWithInterest` for calculating amount of borrowed.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L425-L428
These functions used `lToken.borrowIndex`.
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterestSame(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 borrowIndex = borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].borrowIndex;
        uint256 borrowBalanceSameChain = borrowIndex != 0
@>          ? (borrowBalance[borrower][_lToken].amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex())) / borrowIndex
            : 0;
        return borrowBalanceSameChain;
    }
```
But `LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()` is not updated for now.
Because `LTokenInterface(_lToken)`.`accrueInterest` is not called.
This causes less amount of `vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects`.
Only `lTokenModify`.`accrueInterest` called, so when asset is `lTokenModify`, it calculated correctly but rest of assets calculated incorrectly.

### Attack Path

### Impact

`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` used in many place of protocol to compare between `collateral` and `borrowed`.
`borrowed` is underestimated so this causes wrong comparation.
e.g. Liquidation, Borrowing

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before using `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, whole assets' `LTokenInterface(_lToken)`.`accrueInterest` must be called, not only `lTokenModify`.
