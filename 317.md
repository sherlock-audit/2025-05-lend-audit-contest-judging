# Denial Of Service On Full Loan repayment By Front Running

### Summary

A borrower attempting to repay their entire loan by providing `type(uint256).max` as the repayment amount (`_amount`) in the `repay` function is susceptible to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via front-running. An attacker can submit a transaction with a small repayment for the same borrower but with a higher gas fee. This attacker's transaction will be executed first, reducing the borrower's outstanding debt. Consequently, the original full repayment transaction from the legitimate borrower will then revert because the calculated `repayAmountFinal` (based on the initial debt) will no longer match the actual `borrowAmount` after the attacker's partial repayment. This prevents the legitimate borrower from repaying their loan fully in a single transaction.

### Root Cause

Lack of a check whether the amount being repaid is more than exceeding debt, and when exceeded refunding the amount back to msg.sender.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* A borrower has an existing loan within the protocol.
* The borrower intends to repay the full outstanding loan amount.

### External Pre-conditions


* An attacker possesses a small amount of the borrowed asset.

### Attack Path

1.  Alice has a loan of 1000 USDC. She wants to repay the full amount and constructs a transaction calling the `repay` function with `_amount = type(uint256).max`.
2.  Bob, observing Alice's pending transaction (e.g., via a mempool monitoring tool), crafts a new transaction. This transaction calls the `repay` function for Alice, repaying a small amount (e.g., 1 USDC) of the same borrowed asset. Bob sets a higher gas price for his transaction.
3.  Due to the higher gas price, Bob's transaction is mined and executed before Alice's. Alice's outstanding loan balance is now 999 USDC (assuming no significant interest accrual in the interim).
4.  When Alice's original transaction is finally executed, the contract recalculates the `borrowAmount` based on the initial state (before Bob's repayment). The `repayAmountFinal` will likely be calculated to cover the initial 1000 USDC debt. However, the actual remaining debt is now lower. The internal logic comparing these amounts will likely detect a mismatch (or attempt to repay more than owed without a refund mechanism), causing Alice's transaction to revert.
5.  Alice is now unable to repay her loan fully in a single transaction using the `type(uint256).max` approach and might need to make multiple transactions or query her exact debt.


### Impact

Legitimate users attempting to perform a full loan repayment using a maximum value are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack, preventing them from repaying their loan in a single, convenient transaction. This degrades the user experience and can be particularly problematic in volatile market conditions where timely repayment is crucial.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refund any extra amount to msg.sender on debt repayment.
