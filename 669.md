# Incorrect LEND reward distribution for cross-chain borrows

### Summary

The `distributeBorrowerLend()` function incorrectly uses `borrowWithInterest()` to determine the borrow amount for distributing LEND rewards. However, `borrowWithInterest()` returns the sum of all cross-chain borrows of a token that originated from the current chain (stored in `crossChainBorrows`).

What the function should actually consider are the user's borrows on this chain, regardless of where the borrow was initiated from. In particular, it must include cross-chain collateral records (stored in `crossChainCollaterals`), which represent borrows executed on this chain using collateral from another chain.

As a result:

- Users who borrowed on this chain via cross-chain requests from other chains will not receive any LEND rewards.
- LEND rewards will be distributed based on incorrect borrow values (crossChainBorrows).
- `crossChainBorrows` should not be considered for LEND rewards because those borrows were executed elsewhere.

### Root Cause

- The function uses `borrowWithInterest()`, which returns borrows originated on this chain (`crossChainBorrows`) instead of borrows executed on this chain (`crossChainCollaterals`).

### Internal Pre-conditions

None  

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

#### Attack Path 1: User gets no rewards despite borrowing on this chain

1. Alice borrows 10,000 USDC on Chain A using funds on Chain B as collateral (cross-chain borrow).
2. This creates an entry in `crossChainCollaterals[Alice][USDC]` on Chain A.
3. The protocol later calls `distributeBorrowerLend()` on Chain A to distribute LEND rewards.
4. Internally, `borrowWithInterest()` is called, which only reads from `crossChainBorrows` (i.e., borrows originated from Chain A).
5. Since Alice's borrow was executed on Chain A (not originated), her borrow is ignored.
6. Result: Alice receives 0 LEND despite having an active borrow on this chain.

#### Attack Path 2: User receives rewards despite not borrowing on this chain

1. Bob initiates a cross-chain borrow of 10,000 USDC on Chain B using his Chain A funds as collateral.
2. This creates an entry in `crossChainBorrows[Bob][USDC]` on Chain A.
3. Bob has no borrow activity on Chain A; he only has `crossChainBorrows` here, no `crossChainCollaterals`.
4. The protocol calls `distributeBorrowerLend()` on Chain A.
5. As `borrowWithInterest()` includes Bob’s `crossChainBorrows` , rewards will be calculated with that amount.
6. Result: Bob receives LEND rewards on Chain A for a borrow he actually executed on Chain B .

### Impact

- Users who took cross-chain borrows executed on this chain are excluded from LEND reward distribution.
- User who actually didn't borrowed funds from this chain will get LEND rewards.


### PoC

In `distributeBorrowerLend()`:

```solidity
uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
    add_(
        borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken),
        borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)
    ),
    Exp({ mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex() })
);
```

This calculation:
- Ignores borrows in `crossChainCollaterals`, leading to under-rewarding real borrowers on this chain.
- Includes borrows in `crossChainBorrows`, which shouldn’t be rewarded here, leading to over-rewarding.

### Mitigation

- Introduce a new function (e.g., `borrowWithInterestExecutedHere()`) that aggregates borrows from `crossChainCollaterals` for this chain.
- In `distributeBorrowerLend()`, use:
  - Only borrows executed on this chain (i.e., `crossChainCollaterals`)
  - Exclude `crossChainBorrows`, as those represent debt executed on other chains and shouldn't be rewarded here.
