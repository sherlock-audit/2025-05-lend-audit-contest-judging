# Incorrect LEND reward accounting.

### Summary

LEND rewards are meant to be distributed proportionally based on the user’s borrow or supply balance at a given time. To ensure fairness, the protocol must **account for rewards before any change to the user's borrow or supply balances**. However, in multiple instances within the codebase, reward accounting is incorrectly performed *after* updating the user’s borrow balance. This causes users to accrue more or fewer rewards than they should, leading to unfair distribution. A malicious user can exploit this discrepancy to **steal a disproportionate share of rewards**, while honest users may lose out.

#### Example 1: Under-rewarding borrowers during repayment

In `_updateRepaymentState()`, the borrow balance is reduced before calling `distributeBorrowerLend()`. As a result, the borrower does not accrue LEND rewards on the portion of the debt they just repaid.

```solidity
function _updateRepaymentState(...) private {
    ...
    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
        ...
    } else {
        userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle = borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal;
        userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
        lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(...);
    }

    // @audit-issue reward accounting is done after reducing borrow so rewards won't accrue for the repaid amount
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);
    ...
}
```

#### Example 2: Over-rewarding borrowers during new borrows

In `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`, the borrow balance is increased before reward accounting. This causes borrowers to accrue rewards for past periods using an inflated borrow balance they didn't actually have.

```solidity
function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(...) private {
    ...
    if (found) {
        uint256 newPrincipleWithAmount = (userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle * currentBorrowIndex)
            / userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex;

        userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle = newPrincipleWithAmount + payload.amount;
        userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
        lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(...);
    } else {
        lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(...);
    }

    lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(payload.sender, payload.destlToken);

    // @audit-issue reward accounting should happen before updating borrow state
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(payload.destlToken, payload.sender);
    ...
}
```

### Root Cause

Reward accounting is performed **after** borrow balance updates, instead of **before**, leading to inaccurate reward accruals.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None


### External Pre-conditions

None



### Attack Path

1. Alice and Bob each borrow 100 tokens at block 10.
2. The total borrow is 200 tokens. The LEND reward rate is 10 tokens per block.
3. Between block 10 and block 20, 100 tokens should be distributed equally (50 each).
4. At block 20, Alice borrows an additional 1000 tokens, increasing her borrow to 1100.
5. Since reward accounting happens after updating her borrow balance, Alice is treated as if she had 1100 tokens during the previous 10 blocks.
6. Her share becomes: `10 * (10 * 1100 / 1200) = 91.6` tokens instead of the fair 50 tokens.
7. Bob still accrues 50 tokens. Total rewards accrued = `91.6 + 50 = 141.6`, but only 100 tokens were actually distributed by the compound protocol to the `CoreRouter` (assuming CoreRouter is the only user of Compound fork).
8. Alice claims the inflated rewards first and gets more than her fair share. Bob, claiming later, receives less or even nothing.
9. A malicious user can exploit this by timing large borrows precisely  to steal most or all of the accrued rewards.



### Impact

- **Excess rewards claimed**: A malicious user can steal LEND rewards from the reward pool by inflating their borrow amount before reward accounting.
- **Fair users lose rewards**: Other users will lose their fair share of rewards if they claim after the attacker.

### Mitigation

- **Always perform reward accounting before any state-changing operations** like borrow/supply balance updates.
- Specifically:
  - Call `distributeBorrowerLend()` **before** increasing or decreasing the borrow balance.
  - Call `distributeSupplierLend()` **before** updating the supply balance.
