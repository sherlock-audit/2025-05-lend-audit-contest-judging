# `LendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend()` should be called before updating borrower amount.

### Summary

in `_handleDestRepayMessage()`, `distributeBorrowerLend()` should be called before updating the data structures related to the borrow amount of the borrower.

### Root Cause

In `_handleDestRepayMessage()`, `crossChainBorrows` for the user and the concerned lToken is being updated. To correctly distribute the rewards, `distributeBorrowerLend()` should be called before `updateCrossChainBorrows()`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

Since rewards are calculated based on the current borrow state, updating `crossChainBorrows` before calling `distributeBorrowerLend()` causes the reward calculation to use the post-repayment value instead of the pre-repayment value.
Users may receive less rewards than they are entitled to, especially if they had significant borrow amounts that were repaid in this transaction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that borrower rewards are calculated and distributed accurately before any updates to the borrow state occur.
