# Missing Bad Debt Handling Mechanism

### Summary

The current liquidation mechanism lacks a fallback path for handling bad debt scenarios. If a borrower's position deteriorates beyond the point where the collateral value (even at the liquidation threshold) is insufficient to cover the debt, the protocol is unable to proceed with liquidation. This leads to permanent unliquidatable positions, allowing insolvent accounts to persist and potentially compound protocol losses.


### Root Cause

The `liquidateSeizeUpdate()` function assumes that sufficient collateral is always available for seizure. In cases where the debt surpasses the liquidation-adjusted value of the collateral, the following check causes the entire liquidation attempt to revert:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L289C69-L290C116

```solidity
require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) >= seizeTokens, "Insufficient collateral");
```

In scenarios of severe under-collateralization (bad debt), `seizeTokens`â€”as calculated by:

```solidity
(uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
    .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
```

will exceed the total collateral. As a result, the function call fails and the bad debt remains unliquidated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Bad debt should be occur

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Liquidation incentive for liquidators: 10%

Borrower Debt 100 Dollar
Borrower Collateral 105 Dollar

Liquidator will pay 100 dollar debt and code will try to give him 110 dollar collateral. But it's not possible due to require check. Instead it should continue execution and handle the bad debt ( distribution the bad debt to all the suppliers for minor per capita effect )

### Impact

* **Unrecoverable bad debt**: If a borrower's collateral value drops below the required seizure amount (`seizeTokens`), the liquidation will revert, and the debt remains.

* **Loss compounding**: If multiple positions reach this state during volatile market conditions, cumulative bad debt could destabilize the protocol or lead to loss of suppliers funds



### Mitigation

Consider implementing bad debt handling mechanism for liquidation
