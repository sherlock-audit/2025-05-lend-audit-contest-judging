# M-03 Missing Market Entry Check Before Calling enterMarkets  in `CoreRouter::borrow` can lead to unnecessary gas consumption and may indicate inconsistent logic between core and cross-chain borrowing flows.

### [M-03] Missing Market Entry Check Before Calling enterMarkets `CoreRouter::borrow`

**Description:** 
In the `CoreRouter` contract, the `borrow` function always calls `enterMarkets(_lToken)` for the borrower, regardless of whether the user has already entered the market for that `_lToken`. This is inconsistent with the `CrossChainRouterMock` and `CrossChainRouter`, which first checks if the user has entered the market using `isMarketEntered` before calling `enterMarkets`. Calling `enterMarkets` redundantly can lead to unnecessary gas consumption and may indicate inconsistent logic between core and cross-chain borrowing flows.

**Impact:**  
- **Gas inefficiency:** Users pay extra gas for redundant calls to `enterMarkets`, especially if they borrow multiple times from the same market.
- **Inconsistency:** The logic for market entry is inconsistent between same-chain (`CoreRouter`) and cross-chain (`CrossChainRouterMock`) borrowing, which could lead to confusion or subtle bugs if the market entry logic changes in the future.
- **Potential for unexpected side effects:** If the implementation of `enterMarkets` changes to have side effects on repeated calls, this could introduce new issues.

**Proof of Concept:**  
In `CoreRouter.sol`:
```solidity
// Enter the Compound market
enterMarkets(_lToken);
```

In `CrossChainRouter.sol`:
```solidity
if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)) {
    enterMarkets(_lToken);
}
```

This avoids redundant calls.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Update the `CoreRouter::borrow` function to check if the user has already entered the market before calling `enterMarkets`. Add an internal helper function `isMarketEntered` if not already present. For example:

```diff
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // Only enter market if not already entered
+    if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _token)) {
+        enterMarkets(_token);
+    }
}
```

```solidity
function isMarketEntered(address user, address asset) internal view returns (bool) {
    address[] memory suppliedAssets = lendStorage.getUserSuppliedAssets(user);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length;) {
        if (suppliedAssets[i] == asset) return true;
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
    return false;
}
```
