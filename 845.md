# Insufficient USDT Handling

### Summary

The CoreRouter contract uses the plain transfer function for token transfers in the redeem and borrow functions. This approach can lead to incorrect state updates if the transfer fails for standard ERC20 tokens that return false instead of reverting, potentially causing financial loss for users. While USDT reverts on transfer failure, making it less vulnerable to this specific issue, the lack of consistent handling across all ERC20 tokens, including USDT, poses a broader risk.

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol, the redeem and borrow functions utilize IERC20(_token).transfer to send tokens to the user without checking the return value or using SafeERC20.safeTransfer. For standard ERC20 tokens that return false on transfer failure (instead of reverting), this can result in silent failures where the state is updated despite the transfer not occurring.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The token being used in redeem or borrow is an ERC20 token that returns false on transfer failure instead of reverting.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

When a user invokes redeem or borrow with a token that returns false on transfer failure.The transfer function fails silently (returns false) without reverting.The contract updates its state.In redeem, totalInvestment is decreased.In borrow, the borrow balance is increased.
The user does not receive the tokens, but the state reflects a successful operation, leading to loss of funds or incorrect debt assignment.
For USDT, this specific path is mitigated because its transfer function reverts on failure, preventing state updates in such cases. However, the inconsistent use of plain transfer versus safeTransfer across the protocol increases the risk for other tokens.

### Impact

Users: May lose their investment (in redeem) or incur debt (in borrow) without receiving the corresponding tokens, resulting in financial loss.
Protocol: Risks inconsistent state and potential reputational damage if users encounter losses due to improper token handling.

### Mitigation

Replace IERC20(_token).transfer with SafeERC20.safeTransfer in the redeem and borrow functions of CoreRouter.sol.
