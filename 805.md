# Incorrect borrow index update allows theft of LEND rewards.

### Summary

Users are given LEND rewards when they borrow. This is based on how much they borrow and the rewards are credited with time. [LendStorage::distributeBorrowerLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L342) is responsible for this. The function is called when a user borrow and repay. 

Here, the user's `lendBorrowerIndex` is set to the up-to-date `borrowIndex`. However for first time supplying, `borrowIndex` is set to `LEND_INITIAL_INDEX`. This is then used to calculate the `deltaIndex`, which is used to calculate how much LEND should be given to the borrower. This means no matter the time of the borrow, the user gets LEND rewards as if he had borrowed from the very start of the reward distribution. This allows malicious users to supply, borrow, repay and redeem with a large amount to get LEND rewards at 0 cost within the same block.

### Root Cause

```solidity 
    function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external onlyAuthorized {
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerBorrowIndexUpdate(lToken);
        (uint224 borrowIndex,) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).lendBorrowState(lToken);
        uint256 borrowerIndex = lendBorrowerIndex[lToken][borrower];
        lendBorrowerIndex[lToken][borrower] = borrowIndex;
        if (borrowerIndex == 0 && borrowIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
@>          borrowerIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX;  
        }
        Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(borrowIndex, borrowerIndex)});
        uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(
            add_(borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken), borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)),
            Exp({mantissa: LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex()})
        );
        uint256 borrowerDelta = mul_(borrowerAmount, deltaIndex);
        uint256 borrowerAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[borrower], borrowerDelta);
        lendAccrued[borrower] = borrowerAccrued;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The LEND_INITIAL_INDEX is 1e36. Time passes and borrowIndex is increased to 2e36.
2. The attacker supply collateral and borrow 100e18 token for the first time.
3. His `lendBorrowerIndex` is updated to 2e36 but `borrowerIndex` is set to 1e36.
4. The `deltaIndex` is 1e36, giving the attacker 100e18 LEND tokens. 
5. The attacker repay, redeem and claim his LEND tokens. 


### Impact

LEND rewards can be stolen from users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dont calculate rewards on first borrow or set the `borrowerIndex` to `borrowIndex`.
