# cross-chain borrows are stored with reversed srcEid and destEid, causing them to be ignored in debt calculations

### Summary

In the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function, the `srcEid` and `destEid` values are incorrectly assigned when storing a new cross-chain borrow. Specifically, the function mistakenly sets the destination chain’s `Eid` as the `srcEid`, and the current chain’s `Eid` (i.e., the source chain) as the `destEid`. This misassignment causes the system to misclassify the origin of the borrow.

### Root Cause

The `srcEid` and `destEid` fields in the `LendStorage.Borrow` struct are reversed. However, in functions like `borrowWithInterest`, the logic checks whether a borrow originated from the current chain by comparing `borrow.srcEid == currentEid`. Due to the reversed values, cross-chain borrows appear to have originated elsewhere, and are therefore ignored in liquidity calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice initiates a cross-chain borrow on ARB (the destination chain), borrowing from ETH (the source chain).
2. After successfully transferring borrowed tokens to Alice on ARB, a `ValidBorrowRequest` message is sent to the ETH chain.
3. Upon receiving the message, ETH adds a new cross-chain borrow entry using:
   ```solidity
   lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
       payload.sender,
       payload.srcToken,
       LendStorage.Borrow(
           srcEid,      // ← incorrectly assigned to ARB’s Eid
           currentEid,  // ← incorrectly assigned to ETH’s Eid
           payload.amount,
           payload.borrowIndex,
           payload.destlToken,
           payload.srcToken
       )
   );
   ```
4. This leads to the borrow record having `srcEid = ARB` instead of ETH. Later, when during the liquidity accouting:
   ```solidity
   if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
       // Only include borrows originating from this chain
       borrowedAmount += ...
   }
   ```
   the borrow is ignored because `srcEid != currentEid`.
5. As a result, the user's borrow is not accounted for in total debt calculations.
6. Alice can exploit this by taking unbacked cross-chain loans repeatedly, bypassing collateralization requirements and draining funds from the protocol.

### Impact

Cross-chain borrows are not accounted for in liquidity or borrow limit checks. This allows malicious users to take undercollateralized or uncollateralized loans, leading to loss of funds and insolvency of the lending protocol.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
// In _handleValidBorrowRequest, the srcEid and destEid are flipped
lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
    payload.sender,
    payload.srcToken,
    LendStorage.Borrow(
        srcEid,       // should be currentEid (source chain ID)
        currentEid,   // should be destination chain ID
        ...
    )
);

// In borrowWithInterest, this check fails due to the reversed srcEid
if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
    borrowedAmount += ...;
}
```

### Mitigation

Ensure that when storing a cross-chain borrow:

- Set `Borrow.srcEid = currentEid` (i.e., the source chain where the borrow record is stored).
- Set `Borrow.destEid = srcEid` (i.e., the chain where the user received the borrowed funds).

Update the rest of the protocol to consistently follow this convention for determining the origin and destination of cross-chain borrows.
