# borrowedAmount is multiplied twice with the borrowIndex

### Summary

The borrow function has a bug where it accidentally applies interest twice to a user’s debt. It calls `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which already includes accrued interest, but then multiplies that result again by the current borrowIndex. This double-counting inflates the debt, which can wrongly make it look like the user doesn’t have enough collateral to borrow, blocking valid borrow attempts.


### Root Cause

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

An attacker supplying valid collateral could be wrongly prevented from borrowing due to the inflated debt check. By triggering the borrow function, the protocol overestimates the user’s existing debt, causing the require(collateral >= borrowAmount) check to fail. This blocks users from borrowing even when they should be eligible, effectively locking their collateral unless the logic is fixed.
Also we can notice that this is not the case in crosschain borrow, as in crosschain borrow only uses the value returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` without multiplying it again by the borrowIndex.

### Impact

The user can be prevented from borrowing although his position is healthy.

### PoC

1. A user supplies tokenA as collateral on Chain A
2. The protocol accrues interest on tokenB by advancing time.
3. The user then attempts to borrow 600 tokenB (well below their borrow limit).
4. The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` call already includes interest in the borrowed value.
5. the contract mistakenly multiplies it again by borrowIndex / borrowBalance.borrowIndex, causing double interest application.
6. This will casue the borrow amount to look > collateral causing this to revert: `require(collateral >= borrowAmount) `


### Mitigation

Depend on the value return by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` same what is done in the borrow crosschain
