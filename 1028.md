# The partial repayment calculation on the source chain is incorrect.

### Summary

The partial repayment calculation is incorrect because it does not scale the repayment amount back to the original principleâ€™s index, potentially understating or overstating the debt in future calculations.

### Root Cause

Function _handleDestRepayMessage in contract CrossChainRouter.sol: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L544-L574
On the source chain _handleDestRepayMessage 
```solidity
   uint256 currentBorrow = (userBorrows[index].principle * payload.borrowIndex) / userBorrows[index].borrowIndex;
  
  if (payload.amount >= currentBorrow) {
  
  // Full repayment: remove the borrow
  
  } else {
  
  // Partial repayment: update the principle
  
  userBorrows[index].principle = currentBorrow - payload.amount;
  
  userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;
  
  }
```
This code does:
1. Compute the current borrow amount (with interest) on the source chain as `currentBorrow`.
2. If the repayment amount is less than `currentBorrow`, then it subtracts the repayment amount from `currentBorrow` and sets that as the new principle, and updates the borrow index to the one from the payload (which is the destination chain's borrow index at the time of repayment).

The mistake is that the new principle should be the pre-interest accrual amount. The correct method is:
- The current debt in underlying is `currentBorrow = (principle * currentIndex) / oldIndex`.
- After repaying `R` (underlying), the remaining debt is `currentBorrow - R`.
- Then, we need to express this remaining debt in terms of the new principle at the current index: `newPrinciple = (remainingDebt * oldIndex) / currentIndex`.

The code sets:
```solidity
userBorrows[index].principle = currentBorrow - payload.amount;
```

This sets the principle to the remaining debt in underlying (which is not scaled by the index). Then, when interest is accrued again, the debt will be calculated as:
`(newPrinciple * futureIndex) / currentIndex`

Because the newPrinciple is in underlying, not in the original terms. -> This will lead to an understatement of debt because the principle is not scaled.


Ex: 
- Initial principle: 100 (at index 1.0e18)
- Current index: 1.2e18 -> current debt = 120
- Repay 60 -> remaining debt = 60
- The code sets new principle = 60 and index = 1.2e18.
-if the index moves to 1.4e18, the debt becomes: (60 * 1.4e18) / 1.2e18 = 70.

The correct remaining principle should be: 60 * 1.0e18 / 1.2e18 = 50 (so that when multiplied by 1.4e18 and divided by 1.0e18, we get 70).
-> The code does not convert the remaining debt back to the original principle scale.
