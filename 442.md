# Incorrect Same-Chain Borrow Clearing in `repayBorrowInternal`

## Summary
The [repayBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459) function in `CoreRouter.sol` incorrectly updates or clears same-chain borrow balances when repaying cross-chain borrows, due to not properly checking the `_isSameChain` parameter. This allows users to unintentionally reduce or eliminate their same-chain debts during a cross-chain repayment, enabling them to withdraw collateral without fully repaying their same-chain loans, leading to significant protocol losses.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol`, the `repayBorrowInternal` function updates same-chain borrow balances regardless of the `_isSameChain` parameter:
```solidity
if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
    lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
} else {
    lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
        borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
    );
}
```
When `_isSameChain` is `false` (indicating a cross-chain repayment, called via `CrossChainRouter.sol`), the function still modifies same-chain borrow records in `lendStorage.borrowBalance`. This incorrectly reduces or clears same-chain debts, violating the protocol’s debt tracking integrity.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports both same-chain and cross-chain borrowing, tracked in `LendStorage.borrowBalance` and `crossChainCollaterals`, respectively.
2. The `repayBorrowInternal` function is callable by `CrossChainRouter.sol` for cross-chain repayments with `_isSameChain = false`.
3. A user has both same-chain and cross-chain borrows for the same underlying asset (e.g., USDC).

## External Pre-conditions
1. A user deposits collateral (e.g., $100 ETH) and borrows on the same chain (e.g., 50 USDC) and cross-chain (e.g., 50 USDC on another chain).
2. The user or a liquidator initiates a cross-chain repayment via `CrossChainRouter.repayCrossChainBorrow`.
3. The price oracle (`UniswapAnchoredViewInterface`) provides accurate prices for collateral and borrow assets.

## Attack Path
This issue can be exploited by users to clear same-chain debts without repayment, allowing excess collateral withdrawal. The steps are:

1. **User Sets Up Borrows**:
   - Deposits $100 ETH as collateral on Chain A.
   - Borrows 50 USDC on Chain A (same-chain) and 50 USDC on Chain B (cross-chain).

2. **Cross-Chain Repayment**:
   - User repays 50 USDC cross-chain borrow via `CrossChainRouter.repayCrossChainBorrow`, calling `repayBorrowInternal` with `_isSameChain = false`.

3. **Incorrect Same-Chain Update**:
   - `repayBorrowInternal` calculates `borrowedAmount` as the cross-chain borrow (50 USDC).
   - If `repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount`, it clears same-chain `borrowBalance` for the user, removing the 50 USDC same-chain debt.

4. **Exploitation**:
   - The user’s same-chain debt is erased, but their $100 ETH collateral remains.
   - User withdraws excess collateral (e.g., $50 ETH) via `redeem`, as `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` no longer accounts for the same-chain debt.

5. **Fund Loss**:
   - If the user defaults, the protocol loses 50 USDC, as the remaining collateral is insufficient.

## Impact
- **Direct Fund Loss**: Users can clear same-chain debts without repayment, withdrawing collateral worth more than their remaining obligations, leading to protocol losses (>1% and >$10, Sherlock Section IV).
- **Protocol Integrity**: Incorrect debt tracking undermines the lending protocol’s core functionality, risking insolvency (Section V, breaking core functionality).
- **Sherlock Criteria**: The issue requires only a user with same-chain and cross-chain borrows, a common scenario, with no extensive external conditions (Section IV).

## Mitigation
Modify `repayBorrowInternal` in `CoreRouter.sol` to update `borrowBalance` only when `_isSameChain` is `true`. Update the code as follows:
```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(
    address borrower,
    address liquidator,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _lToken,
    bool _isSameChain
) internal {
    address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);
    LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
    uint256 borrowedAmount;
    if (_isSameChain) {
        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
    }
    require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");
    uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
    IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);
    _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);
    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");
    if (_isSameChain) {
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }
    }
    emit RepaySuccess(borrower, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);
}
```
This ensures same-chain borrow balances are only modified for same-chain repayments, preserving debt tracking integrity for cross-chain operations.
