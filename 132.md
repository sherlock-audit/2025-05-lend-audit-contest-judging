# Excess fees can be lost

### Summary

The refund address passed to `_lzSend` is the CrossChainRouter contract address implemented [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820). 


According to the layerzero [docs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#implementing-_lzsend) - 

> If your refund address is a smart contract, you will need to implement a fallback function in order for it to receive the refund.

However, the `CrossChainRouter` contract lacks a `fallback` function implementation

This could potentially lead to the loss of excess fees, as LayerZero will be unable to refund them.

### Root Cause

Missing implementation of `fallback` function in [CrossChainRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol)

### Impact

Any unused or excess fees sent with `_lzSend` may be permanently lost.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a fallback function - 


```solidity 
fallback() external payable {}
```
