# Using ERC20 Transfer Function Without Checking for Success in the `CoreRouter` Contract

## Vulnerability Details
In the `redeem`, `borrow`, and `borrowForCrossChain` functions, token transfers are performed via the `ERC20::transfer` function. This function returns a boolean indicating whether the transfer was successful. It is essential to capture and verify this return value to ensure that the transfer has succeeded. However, in the mentioned functions, these return values are neither checked nor handled.

For example, in the `redeem` function, there is a line of code like the following:

```solidity
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

Not checking the return value of the transfer function is considered a bad practice and can lead to vulnerabilities.

## POC
The issue of unchecked return values from `ERC20::transfer` has been previously reported in the Sherlock contest: ([issue #169](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/169))

## Impact
If the token transfer fails and the return value is not checked, the transaction will not revert, potentially leading to loss of funds for users. For example, in the redeem function, users might lose their cToken amount without receiving the corresponding underlying tokens.

## Mitigation
Replace the use of `ERC20::transfer` with `SafeERC20::safeTransfer`, which handles the success check internally and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails.
