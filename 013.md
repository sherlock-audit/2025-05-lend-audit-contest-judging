# Incorrect Accounting Due to Stale Exchange Rate in updateTotalInvestment

### Summary

The supply function in CoreRouter calculates the number of lTokens to credit a user using a potentially stale exchangeRateStored value (i.e., before interest is accrued in the lToken contract). This value is then used to update the user's investment record in LendStorage via updateTotalInvestment. If the exchange rate is outdated, the user may be credited with more lTokens than they should receive.



### Root Cause

The calculation of mintTokens uses exchangeRateStored before calling mint(), which may not reflect the most recent interest accrual.
The actual lTokens minted are determined by the lToken contract, which should update the exchange rate internally, but the storage/accounting in LendStorage is based on the pre-mint, potentially stale rate.
There is no check or reconciliation between the actual lTokens minted and the amount recorded in LendStorage.

```solidity
   function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        ...
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Token interest not updated for some time and exchangeRateStored becomes stale
A user supply tokens and mint more tokens because of stale rate


### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. An attacker waits until the lToken's exchangeRateStored is stale (interest has accrued but not yet updated).
2. The attacker supplies tokens, triggering the supply function.
3. The contract calculates mintTokens using the old, lower exchange rate, crediting the attacker with more lTokens in LendStorage than they actually receive from the lToken contract.
4. After interest is accrued and the exchange rate is updated, the attacker redeems their lTokens, withdrawing more than their fair share of the underlying assets.
5. This results in a loss for other users, as the attacker's over-credited share reduces the pool available for honest users

### Impact

The attacker can withdraw more than their fair share, causing a deficit in the pool.
If enough users exploit this, the protocol may not have enough assets to cover all withdrawals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call accrueInterest() on the contract before reading exchangeRateStored and before minting.
