# [M-2] Missing ETH Withdrawal Mechanism in CoreRouter Leads to Permanent Fund Locking

### Summary

The CoreRouter contract contains a `receive()` function marked as payable, allowing it to receive native ETH. However, it lacks a mechanism to withdraw ETH (e.g., a `withdrawEth()` function). This creates a vulnerability where ETH sent to the contract becomes permanently locked , rendering the funds unrecoverable. While crossChainRouter implements a withdrawal function, CoreRouter fails to include one, creating an inconsistent and insecure design.

### Root Cause

> Empty `receive()` Function:
```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```
- This allows the contract to receive ETH but provides no logic to disburse it.

> Missing Withdrawal Function:
- The contract lacks a `withdrawEth()` function (like crossChainRouter) to extract ETH

### Impact

ETH sent to the contract is irretrievably lost


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a Safe Withdrawal Function similar to crossChainRouter contract:

```solidity
function withdrawEth() external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No ETH to withdraw");
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
    require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
}
```
