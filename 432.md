# user can't borrow even if he has sufficient collateral due to wrong calculation of collateral of user

### Summary

when we call borrowCrossChain function in chain A it will calculate collateral we has in this chain and triggers _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest function in chainB,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L138-L154
```solidity
        (, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);


        // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
        // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
            collateral,
            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
    }
```
and we see _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest function in chainB,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617-L622
```solidity
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );


        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
this will check weather this user has sufficient collateral backing his borrowing or not by above check.
But here it didn't consider user collateral in this chain, it only considers collateral of user in chain A so this line will revert even if he has sufficient collateral to back in borrowings.

### Root Cause

not considering collateral of borrower in chain B in below lines of code,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617-L622
```solidity
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );


        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

user collateral in both chain A and chain B will combined sufficient to back this borrow but insufficient if we take only collateral of user in chain A under consideration.

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

none 

### Impact

user can't borrow funds even if he has sufficient collateral

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

also consider collateral of user in chain B,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L617-L622
```solidity
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );


        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
