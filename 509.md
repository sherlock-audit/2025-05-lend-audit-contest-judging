# Cross-Chain Debt Repayment Failure

### Summary

The borrowWithInterest function incorrectly calculates borrowed amounts for cross-chain debts due to flawed validation logic. As a result, the repayBorrowInternal function always reverts when attempting to repay cross-chain borrows, rendering such debts permanently unrepayable.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from an incorrect condition in `borrowWithInterest`:

```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
```
This check requires that both `srcEid` (source chain) and `destEid` (destination chain) match the current chain, which is impossible for legitimate cross-chain borrows. Consequently:

- Cross-chain borrows are **excluded** from the `borrowedAmount` calculation.

- `repayBorrowInternal` fails due to `borrowedAmount = 0`, blocking repayments.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have an active cross-chain borrow (recorded in `crossChainCollaterals`).
2. The repayment attempt must occur on the **destination chain** (where the borrowed funds were received).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol must support cross-chain borrowing.
2. The repayment transaction must be initiated on the correct chain (where the debt is recorded).

### Attack Path

1. **Borrow Cross-Chain**:  
   - User borrows funds from Chain A (source) to Chain B (destination).  
   - Debt is recorded in `crossChainCollaterals` on Chain B.
2. **Attempt Repayment**:  
   - User calls `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow` on Chain B.  
   - `borrowWithInterest` returns `0` due to the incorrect condition.  
   - Transaction reverts with `"Borrowed amount is 0"`.  
3. **Debt Becomes Unrepayable**:  
   - The user cannot reduce or clear their debt.  



### Impact

Cross-chain debts **cannot be repaid**, breaking a core protocol function. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the condition to correctly identify cross-chain debts:
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid) {
    borrowedAmount += 
        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / 
        collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
}
```
