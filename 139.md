# Protocol fee can be stucked

### Summary

When liquidation takes place on same chain or cross chain the protocol charges a part of collateral as `PROTOCOL_FEE` before sending the collateral to liqudatator. Implentation of this can be seen in [CoreRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L292) and [CrossChainRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L314)

However, there is no function to remove this accumulated protocol fee, which causes the protocol fee to be stuck in the contract. 

### Root Cause

No function to remove this accumulated protocol fee in `CoreRouter` and `CrossChainCoreRouter`

> The contracts are also not upgradable hence it seems to be a valid high. Hope judges take all the points into consideration before making a decision


### Impact
This causes a loss of the entire protocol fee as it gets stuck and cannot be withdrawn by the protocol admin.



### Mitigation

Implement this function in both `CoreRouter` and `CrossChainRouter`

```solidity 
function removeProtocolReward(address _lToken) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 reward = lendStorage.protocolReward(_lToken);
        require(reward > 0, "No protocol reward to remove");

        // Reset protocol reward
        lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(_lToken, 0);

        // Transfer the reward to the owner
        IERC20(_lToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward);
    }
```
