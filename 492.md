# Cross-Chain Borrow Index Corruption Enables Debt Manipulation

### Summary

Improper synchronization of borrow index states during cross-chain operations will cause incorrect debt accounting for the protocol as users can exploit time gaps between index updates to artificially reduce their debt obligations and avoid liquidation.

### Root Cause

In [[CoreRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L630C9-L639C15)] the debt update logic assumes borrow indexes are synchronized across chains:
```solidity
// _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest
uint256 newPrincipleWithAmount = (userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle * currentBorrowIndex)
    / userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex;
```
This is a mistake because borrow indexes evolve independently on each chain, and the current index on the destination chain may not match the index on the source chain. As a result, debt becomes inconsistently scaled across chains.

Borrow indexes evolve independently across chains.

The destination chain index is used even though the borrow originated on a different chain.

This mismatch allows attackers to repay less than the actual debt when destination-chain interest is lower.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The borrower has an active cross-chain borrow position.

The destination chain’s borrow index is lower than the source chain’s.

The protocol uses destination chain index for repayment logic.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

Borrower opens a borrow position on Chain A (source) at high interest (e.g., index = 1.5e18).

Later, they repay on Chain B (destination) where index is lower (e.g., 1.2e18).

The protocol computes their repayment amount using Chain B’s index.

The borrower repays less than they actually owe.

The protocol updates the borrow state using Chain B’s lower index.

Over time, this introduces systemic underpayment and debt misrepresentation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers systemic debt erosion as borrowers repay using under-valued indices. This leads to underfunding and potential liquidity shortfall. Estimated impact is 0.5–5% of TVL annually depending on cross-chain rate divergence and volume of cross-chain debt.

### PoC

```solidity
// Chain A: High interest environment (index = 1.5e18)
// Chain B: Low interest environment (index = 1.2e18)

// Original borrow: 100 ETH at 1.0e18 index
// Repayment amount: full (type(uint256).max triggers full repayment logic)

// Flawed logic (using Chain B index)
scaledDebt = (100e18 * 1.2e18) / 1.0e18 = 120e18  // Underestimates actual debt
// Actual expected:
correctDebt = (100e18 * 1.5e18) / 1.0e18 = 150e18

// User repays 120 ETH and debt is marked cleared
// Protocol misses 30 ETH

```

### Mitigation

Use the source chain’s current borrow index for all debt calculations, both for borrowing and repayment:
In _getBorrowDetails() and _updateRepaymentState(), ensure scaling uses sourceIndex instead of LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex().

```solidity
function getScaledDebt(BorrowPosition memory pos) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 sourceIndex = LendingRegistry.getBorrowIndex(pos.srcEid);
    return (pos.principal * sourceIndex) / pos.borrowIndex;
}
```
