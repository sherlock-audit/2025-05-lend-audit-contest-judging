# Impossible cross-chain borrows of USDT.

### Summary

When borrowing via [CrossChainRouter.sol::borrowCrossChain()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113), on the Destination Chain with collateral on the Source Chain, `CoreRouter.sol::borrowForCrossChain()` is called. This function borrows from the Ltoken then transfer to the borrower. However it is impossible to cross-chain borrow USDT as the function uses `IERC20.transfer()`.

### Root Cause

After initiating a cross-chain borrow, the Destination Chain (The chain where we will borrow fund from), calls [CrossChainRouter.sol::_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L625) upon receiving the message. After doing some checks it calls `CoreRouter.sol::borrowForCrossChain()`, to handle the transfer of funds to the borrower.

In [CoreRouter.sol::borrowForCrossChain()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L204), after borrowing from the LToken, it attempts to transfer the funds to the borrower. This works fine for normal ERC-20s but not for USDT. The [IERC20.transfer()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/dc44c9f1a4c3b10af99492eed84f83ed244203f6/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L41) expects a boolean return while USDT does not, making the call revert everytime. 

```solidity 
    function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");
        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
        require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
@>      IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol must allow users to supply/borrow USDT (They stated they will in contest details page)


### External Pre-conditions

1. User must try to borrow on the Destination Chain, with collateral from the Source Chain.

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Cross-chain borrows for USDT will always fail. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

OZ's SafeERC20 is imported and already used (in supply()), use it in borrowForCrossChain() too.

```diff
    function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        ...
-       IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
+       IERC20(_destUnderlying).safeTransfer(_borrower, _amount); 
    }
```
