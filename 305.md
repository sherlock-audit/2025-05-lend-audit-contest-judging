# Cross-chain repayment will incorrectly update same-chain borrow state, causing protocol state inconsistency

### Summary

The lack of a conditional check in `repayBorrowInternal()` will cause an incorrect update of local `borrowBalance` even for cross-chain repayments. As a result, the protocol will mistakenly register a same-chain borrow for the user, even though the borrow happened on a remote chain. This inconsistency can lead to miscalculations in liquidity, liquidation, or reward eligibility.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol: 497` (inside `repayBorrowInternal()`), the function updates `borrowBalance` unconditionally unless the full borrow amount is repaid. However, for **cross-chain repayments**, this value should never be touched. The same function is reused for both same-chain and cross-chain repayments, but lacks proper conditional branching for state updates.

```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(
    address borrower,
    address liquidator,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _lToken,
    bool _isSameChain
) internal {
    address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

    LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    if (_isSameChain) {
        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
    }

    require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");

    uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

    // Transfer tokens from the liquidator to the contract
    IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);

    _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);

    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);

    // Repay borrowed tokens
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");

    // Update same-chain borrow balances
    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
        lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
497     lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
            borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
        );
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has an active **cross-chain borrow** from another chain.
2. A **partial repayment** is initiated from the destination chain via `repayCrossChainBorrow()`.

### External Pre-conditions

None; triggered entirely within protocol control flow during a legitimate cross-chain repayment.

### Attack Path

1. User borrows 100 USDC cross-chain from Chain A (collateral) to Chain B (borrow).
2. User repays 50 USDC on Chain B.
3. The repayment is routed through `CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal(...)` with `_isSameChain == false`.
4. Even though the borrow originated cross-chain, the contract updates `borrowBalance` on **Chain B**, as if the user borrowed locally.
5. Now `borrowBalance` on Chain B shows a residual borrow (50 USDC) that never existed locally, contaminating protocol state.

### Impact

- **Incorrect protocol state**: Same-chain borrow balance is falsely created.
- **Double accounting**: Userâ€™s borrow is recorded **both** as cross-chain and same-chain.
- **Incorrect reward/lending/liquidity calculations**: Based on this invalid borrow.
- **Potential false liquidation scenarios** or **missed liquidation** depending on later logic paths.

### Mitigation

Add a guard clause that ensures local `borrowBalance` is only updated when `_isSameChain == true`.
```solidity
+	if (_isSameChain) {
	    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
	        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
	        lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
	    } else {
	        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
	            borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
	        );
	    }
+	}
```
