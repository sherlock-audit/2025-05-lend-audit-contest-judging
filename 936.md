# Incorrect chain identity check in `borrowWithInterest()` enables understated debt

## Title
Incorrect chain identity check in `borrowWithInterest()` enables understated debt

## Summary
The function `borrowWithInterest()` in the lending protocol uses an incorrect condition to identify valid cross-chain collateral borrow records. Specifically, in the `else` branch where `crossChainCollaterals` is evaluated, it requires both `srcEid` and `destEid` to equal the `currentEid`. This contradicts the semantics of cross-chain borrowing, where `srcEid` and `destEid` should be different. As a result, valid cross-chain borrow records may be excluded from interest calculation, leading to underreported debt and potential over-withdrawal or under-liquidation.

## Root Cause
The issue lies in the following line within the `else` branch of [`borrowWithInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504)
```solidity
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
```
This check erroneously filters for borrow records where both the source and destination endpoint IDs are the current chain's ID. In a true cross-chain scenario:
`destEid` = chain holding collateral (i.e., currentEid)
`srcEid` = chain where borrow originated (â‰  currentEid)
By enforcing both IDs to be the same, legitimate borrow records are skipped.

## Internal Pre-conditions
A user has performed a cross-chain borrow, where the borrow was initiated on Chain A and the collateral was posted on Chain B (the current chain in context)
The `crossChainCollaterals` mapping is populated on Chain B
The `borrowWithInterest()` function is called on Chain B

## External Pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User supplies a collateral to chain A and initiate a cross-chain borrow
2. The user performs a liquidation-sensitive operation (e.g., more borrowing, withdrawals) on Chain B. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is called and inside, `borrowWithInterest()` fails to account for the cross-chain collateral due to the faulty condition
3. The user's total borrow is underestimated

## Impact
Borrowers can exceed safe lending ratios without triggering liquidation mechanisms

## POC
None

## Mitigation
Update the conditional check in the `borrowWithInterest()` function
```diff
-   if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)
+   if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid != currentEid)
```
