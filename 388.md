# Excess ETH Refunds Sent to Contract Instead of Users

### Summary

Incorrect refund address configuration will cause a loss of excess ETH for users as the CrossChainRouter contract will retain LayerZero fee refunds instead of returning them to the original payer.

### Root Cause

## Root Cause
In [CrossChainRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820), the refund address is set to `payable(address(this))` instead of the user who paid the fees, causing all excess ETH to be retained by the contract rather than refunded to the user.

```solidity
_lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
//                                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                                                          Wrong refund address
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `borrowCrossChain()` with more ETH than the actual LayerZero messaging fee
2. Contract balance needs to be sufficient to cover the LayerZero messaging fee
3. User's excess ETH gets added to the contract balance

### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero messaging fee needs to be less than the total ETH sent by the user
2. LayerZero endpoint needs to process the message successfully and issue refunds for excess fees


### Attack Path

1. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` with 0.1 ETH while LayerZero fee is only 0.02 ETH
2. User's 0.1 ETH is added to contract balance (`address(this).balance`)
3. Contract calls `_lzSend()` with `MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0)` (entire balance as fee)
4. LayerZero endpoint receives 0.1 ETH but only needs 0.02 ETH for the message
5. LayerZero refunds excess 0.08 ETH to `payable(address(this))` (the contract)
6. User's excess 0.08 ETH remains trapped in the contract
7. Only the contract owner can withdraw the trapped funds via `withdrawEth()`

### Impact

Users suffer a loss equal to their excess ETH payments above the actual LayerZero messaging fees. On expensive chains like Ethereum, this could result in significant losses (tens to hundreds of dollars per transaction). The contract accumulates user funds that can only be recovered by the owner, creating a centralized risk and unfair value extraction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Change refund address to user**: 
   ```solidity
   _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(msg.value, 0), payable(msg.sender));
   ```

or
2. Implement proper fee calculation
