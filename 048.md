# CrossChainRouter Fails to Support Account Abstraction Wallets Due to Address Inconsistency Across Chains

## Summary
The protocol's cross-chain operations assume address homogeneity across chains by exclusively using `msg.sender` (source chain address) for destination chain operations. This breaks functionality for account abstracted wallets (smart contract wallets) where addresses differ across chains due to non-deterministic deployment, leading to fund lockups, failed liquidations, and corrupted accounting.

## Finding Description
The core issue occurs because the contract propagates `msg.sender` (source chain address) to destination chains via payloads. When account abstracted wallets (which have different addresses per chain) are used, destination chain operations fail because:
1. Destination chain uses source address for state updates
2. Destination address isn't recognized by protocol
3. Users can't access destination-chain assets attributed to source address

**Specific occurrences in code:**
1. **Borrowing** (`borrowCrossChain`):
   - Source chain address (`msg.sender`) sent to destination chain via payload
   - Destination chain attributes borrowed funds to source address ([Code Reference](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/contracts/CrossChainRouter.sol#L120-L132))

2. **Liquidation handling** (`_handleLiquidationExecute`):
   - Updates `totalInvestment` for source address on destination chain ([Code Reference](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/contracts/CrossChainRouter.sol#L320-L324))

3. **Borrow position tracking** (`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`):
   - Stores collateral under source address on destination chain ([Code Reference](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/contracts/CrossChainRouter.sol#L516-L532))

4. **Repayment handling** (`_handleDestRepayMessage`):
   - Modifies borrow positions using source address ([Code Reference](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/contracts/CrossChainRouter.sol#L615-L619))

5. **Reward distribution** (Multiple locations):
   - Distributes LEND rewards to source address on destination chain ([Code Reference](https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/contracts/CrossChainRouter.sol#L534))

## Impact
**Critical severity** due to:
1. Permanent fund lockups - Borrowed assets sent to unreachable addresses
2. Broken liquidations - Cannot attribute positions to correct accounts
3. Accounting corruption - Collateral/borrow positions mapped incorrectly
4. Lost rewards - Distributed to wrong addresses
5. Protocol insolvency risk - Unrepayable loans due to address mismatch

## Proof of Concept
### Scenario:
1. **User Setup**:
   - Source Chain (Ethereum) address: 0xSource
   - Destination Chain (Polygon) address: 0xDest (different from 0xSource)

2. **Borrow Action**:
   ```solidity
   // On Ethereum (source)
   borrowCrossChain(100, USDC, PolygonID) // Sends 0xSource in payload
   
   // On Polygon (destination)
   _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest() attributes 100 USDC to 0xSource
   ```
3. **Result**:
   - 100 USDC sent to 0xSource on Polygon
   - User controls 0xDest on Polygon → CANNOT ACCESS FUNDS
   - Borrow position recorded under 0xSource → CANNOT REPAY

4. **Liquidation Attempt**:
   ```solidity
   liquidateCrossChain(0xSource, ...) // Fails: No 0xSource account on Polygon
   ```

## Recommendation
### Code Changes:
1. Modify payload struct to include destination recipient:
   ```diff
   struct LZPayload {
   +   address destRecipient;  // Add this field
       uint256 amount;
       ... 
   }
   ```
2. Update borrow function to accept destination recipient:
   ```diff
   function borrowCrossChain(
       uint256 _amount,
       address _borrowToken,
   -   uint32 _destEid
   +   uint32 _destEid,
   +   address destRecipient  // User specifies dest address
   ) external payable {
       ...
       _send(
           _destEid,
           _amount,
           0,
           collateral,
           msg.sender,
           destLToken,
           address(0),
           _borrowToken,
   +       destRecipient,  // Include in payload
           ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
       );
   }
   ```
3. Use `destRecipient` in destination handlers:
   ```diff
   function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
       ...
   -   CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, ...);
   +   CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.destRecipient, ...);
       
       ...
   -   lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(payload.sender, ...);
   +   lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(payload.destRecipient, ...);
   }
   ```
4. Update all cross-chain handlers to use `destRecipient` for:
   - Asset transfers
   - State updates
   - Reward distributions

### Additional Recommendations:
1. Implement address registry contract for wallet address resolution
2. Add destination address parameter to all cross-chain functions
3. Include strict address validation (prevent zero-address)
