# Any User will withdraw LEND all LEND Token in the from the Core Router

### Summary

Absence of the resetting of the user's lendAccrued to ZERO after calling `CoreRouter::claimLend()` allows the user to continue to claim every single LEND token sent to the CoreRouter. 
This will prevent other users (whether borrowers or suppliers) from claiming their LEND token. 

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol:402` the contract is missing to set the `userAccrued LEND token balance` to zero after grating his/her LEND token Accrued.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Users need to supply and/or borrow from the protocol.  
2. The `attacker` is a user who has either supplied to or borrowed from the protocol.  
3. The protocol rewards borrowers and suppliers with `LEND` tokens.  
4. The `attacker` calls `CoreRouter.claimLend()` to claim their accrued `LEND` tokens.  
5. The `attacker` receives the accrued `LEND` tokens, but their `lendAccrued` value is not reset to zero.  
6. The `attacker` can repeatedly call `CoreRouter.claimLend()` to drain all `LEND` tokens held by the `CoreRouter`.


### Impact

Other users, whether borrowers or suppliers, will lose their LEND tokens. The attacker will claim and gain all the LEND tokens sent to the `CoreRouter`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

After any user claims LEND token, set his LEND Accrued value to ZERO.
