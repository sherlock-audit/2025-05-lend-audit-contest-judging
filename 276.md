# Cross-chain borrowing violates invariant

### Summary

Cross-chain borrowing can violate the dual-mapping invariant enforced in `borrowWithInterest()`, causing all user operations to revert permanently. The invariant requires that only one of `crossChainBorrows` or `crossChainCollaterals` mappings can be populated for a user-token pair, but multi-directional cross-chain borrowing breaks this assumption.

### Root Cause

The [`borrowWithInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L485) function enforces an invariant that only one mapping can be populated:

```solidity
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
    Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
    Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

    require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
    // ...
}
```

However, the cross-chain borrowing process can populate both mappings on the same chain when that chain acts as both source and destination:

1. When user borrows from Chain A to Chain B:
   - **`crossChainCollaterals[user][token]` populated on Chain B**,
   - `crossChainBorrows[user][token]` populated on Chain A
2. When same user later borrows from Chain B to Chain C:
   - `crossChainCollaterals[user][token]` populated on Chain C,
   - **`crossChainBorrows[user][token]` populated on Chain B**

Result: Chain B has both mappings populated, violating the invariant.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral on Ethereum and Base networks
2. User initiates cross-chain borrow from Ethereum to Base:
   - Base (destination) receives funds and adds entry to `crossChainCollaterals[user][token]`
   - Base sends confirmation back to Ethereum
   - Ethereum (source) receives confirmation and adds entry to `crossChainBorrows[user][token]`
3. User initiates cross-chain borrow from Base to Sonic:
   - Sonic (destination) receives funds and adds entry to `crossChainCollaterals[user][token]`  
   - Sonic sends confirmation back to Base
   - Base (source) receives confirmation and adds entry to `crossChainBorrows[user][token]`
4. Base now has both `crossChainBorrows[user][token]` and `crossChainCollaterals[user][token]` populated
5. Any operation calling `borrowWithInterest()` on Base permanently reverts with "Invariant violated"

### Impact

**High** - Complete account freeze for affected users on the intermediate chain. All operations that call `borrowWithInterest()` will revert, including:

1. LEND reward distribution via `distributeBorrowerLend()`
2. Borrow operations via `CoreRouter.borrow()`
3. Repayment operations via `CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal()`
4. Liquidation calculations via `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()`
5. Account liquidity calculations via `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`

Users become permanently unable to:
- Claim LEND rewards
- Perform new borrows
- Repay existing debt
- Be liquidated when undercollateralized

This creates systemic risk as undercollateralized positions cannot be liquidated, potentially leading to bad debt accumulation.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Disallow cross-chain borrow inside `borrowCrossChain()` when any entries already exist in `crossChainCollaterals` mapping.
