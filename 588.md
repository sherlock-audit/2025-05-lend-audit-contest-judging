# Free, Zero-Cost Cross-Chain Liquidation

### Summary

In `CrossChainRouter._executeLiquidationCore`, the contract calculates how many collateral tokens to seize (`seizeTokens`) and immediately emits a LayerZero message to the collateral chain, but never pulls in or escrows the repay-amount tokens on the debt chain. As a result, an attacker can liquidate a borrower’s position across chains and seize 100% of their collateral without ever repaying any debt.


### Root Cause

The cross-chain liquidation path omits any ERC-20 transfer or call to `CoreRouter.repayCrossChainLiquidation` before computing and sending the seize message. The protocol assumes repayment will occur later, but by then the collateral has already been seized.

```solidity
    function _executeLiquidationCore(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private {
        // Calculate seize tokens
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(params.borrowedAsset);

        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
            .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, params.lTokenToSeize, params.repayAmount);

        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Seize calculation failed");

        // Send message to Chain A to execute the seize
        _send(
            params.srcEid,
            seizeTokens,
            params.storedBorrowIndex,
            0,
            params.borrower,
            lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to Chain A version before sending
            msg.sender,
            params.borrowedAsset,
            ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
        );
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The borrower has an outstanding cross-chain borrow and has supplied sufficient collateral on chain A.  
- The `CrossChainRouter` is authorized and configured with LayerZero endpoints, `lendStorage`, and `lendtroller`.  
- The close-factor check in `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` passes (i.e. borrower is eligible for liquidation).


### External Pre-conditions

- A malicious liquidator calls `CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain(...)` on chain B, specifying a non-zero `repayAmount`.  
- No approval or token transfer from the liquidator to the router is required, so the call succeeds without any ERC-20 `approve` or `transferFrom`.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits collateral on chain A and incurs a cross-chain borrow on chain B.  
2. Attacker waits until borrower’s position becomes liquidatable (shortfall).  
3. Attacker (as liquidator) calls `liquidateCrossChain(borrower, repayAmount, srcEid, lTokenToSeize, borrowedAsset)` on chain B.  
4. `_executeLiquidationCore` computes `(err, seizeTokens)` and immediately invokes `_send(...)` to chain A to seize collateral.  
5. Collateral is seized on chain A via `_handleLiquidationExecute`, transferring borrower’s posted collateral to the attacker.  
6. Only afterward would `_handleLiquidationSuccess` on chain B attempt the repay via `CoreRouter.repayCrossChainLiquidation`, but by then the collateral has already been stolen. Moreover, this call reverts due to missing token escrow, but the collateral theft is irreversible.


### Impact

Critical loss of user funds: a malicious liquidator can seize 100% of a borrower’s collateral without paying any portion of the underlying debt.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before computing or sending any seize instruction, require and escrow the repay-amount tokens on chain B.
