# CoreRouter is vulnerable to direct LToken liquidation

### Summary

CoreRouter contract can be liquidated directly through LToken contracts, bypassing CoreRouter's accounting system. When CoreRouter borrows tokens from LToken markets, the LToken tracks CoreRouter as a borrower in its `accountBorrows` mapping. If CoreRouter becomes liquidatable, anyone can call `LToken.liquidateBorrowInternal` directly to liquidate CoreRouter's position, while CoreRouter's internal accounting remains unaware.

### Root Cause

When users borrow, the CoreRouter borrows tokens from LToken contracts by calling [`LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L167). This registers CoreRouter as a borrower in the LToken's `accountBorrows` mapping:

```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ...
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
    // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    // ...
}
```

However, CoreRouter has no protection against direct liquidation via LToken's `liquidateBorrowInternal` function. The LToken's liquidation mechanism only checks:
- Borrower has shortfall via `lendtroller.liquidateBorrowAllowed`
- Standard liquidation constraints (close factor, etc.)

There is no check preventing CoreRouter itself from being the liquidation target.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. CoreRouter must have large borrows from LToken markets

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market conditions cause CoreRouter's collateral to become insufficient

### Attack Path

1. Large user deposits significant collateral and borrows the maximum amount through CoreRouter
2. Market conditions swing downward, making CoreRouter's position liquidatable
3. User, in a liquidation attempt, calls `LToken.liquidateBorrowInternal(address(coreRouter), repayAmount, lTokenCollateral)` directly
4. LToken processes liquidation:
   - Accepts repayment from the user
   - Seizes CoreRouter's lToken collateral 
   - Transfers seized collateral (minus protocol fee) to the user
5. The user uses the liquidation proceeds to repay their debt through CoreRouter
6. CoreRouter's LendStorage accounting remains unchanged - still shows the user's original positions
7. The user profits from liquidation rewards while CoreRouter bears the loss

### Impact

**High** - This enables essentially free self-liquidation with multiple severe consequences:

1. Liquidation losses are distributed across all CoreRouter lenders proportionally
2. Lower total investment reduces LEND token distribution to legitimate users  
3. Repeated attacks could drain CoreRouter's collateral, threatening protocol solvency

While requiring multiple large borrowers or specific market conditions reduces the likelihood, the attack becomes possible when CoreRouter aggregates sufficient large positions that become liquidatable simultaneously.
Additionally, an ability to borrow cross-chain increases the possibility for CoreRouter to become liquidatable since the collateral exists on the source chain. Therefore it is not accounted for by LToken and Lendtroller on the destination chain where borrowing occurs.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Implement liquidation protection for CoreRouter in LToken contracts by adding a borrower whitelist or modifying `liquidateBorrowAllowed` to reject liquidations where the borrower is a known Router contract. Alternatively, modify CoreRouter to monitor its health ratio and automatically deleverage positions before becoming liquidatable.
