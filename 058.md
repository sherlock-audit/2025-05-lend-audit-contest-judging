# mproper allowance handling in _approveToken enables front-running in supply, causing token theft

### Summary

The missing atomicity in the internal _approveToken function will cause ERC20 token theft for users supplying assets via the supply function, as an attacker can front-run the approval reset to execute a transferFrom on the contract’s balance. The race condition stems from splitting the allowance update into a reset-to-zero and re-approve sequence, enabling an attacker to exploit this window and drain tokens.


### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol: _approveToken, the function resets the allowance using safeApprove(_approvalAddress, 0) before re-approving the new _amount.

This reset-and-set sequence introduces a race condition: the spender can monitor the mempool and front-run the re-approve step with a transferFrom call, exploiting the brief moment where the allowance is non-zero.

In the supply function (which calls _approveToken to approve tokens for minting lTokens), this creates a vulnerability for any user calling supply.

### Internal Pre-conditions

 The supply function is called with a non-zero _amount and a supported _token.
 The _approveToken function is triggered to approve the lending protocol’s lToken for the supplied token.
The ERC20 token’s allowance system supports the standard approve pattern (susceptible to race conditions).

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker (spender) is able to observe the safeApprove transactions in the mempool.
Network conditions allow front-running (e.g., through MEV or higher gas fees).

### Attack Path

1️⃣ User calls supply(_amount, _token) to supply tokens.
2️⃣ _approveToken is invoked, which resets the allowance to 0 and then sets it to _amount.
3️⃣ The attacker observes the allowance reset in the mempool and sends a transferFrom transaction targeting the contract’s token balance using the old allowance (before reset).
4️⃣ The attacker’s transaction is executed before the new allowance is set, stealing tokens from the contract.
5️⃣ The user’s supply fails or loses tokens due to the drained balance.

### Impact

Affected Party: The protocol and its users supplying tokens via supply.

Impact: Loss of user-supplied tokens as an attacker exploits the approval race to drain tokens. The attacker’s gain equals the approved token amount.

Severity: High/Critical — This can result in significant financial loss and disrupts normal supply operations.

### PoC

// User calls supply(1000, token);
// _approveToken resets approval to 0
// Attacker front-runs with transferFrom before the new approval
IERC20(token).transferFrom(CoreRouter, attacker, 1000);

This directly drains the contract’s balance of _token, disrupting lending operations and causing user losses.

### Mitigation

Replace reset-and-set logic in _approveToken with safeIncreaseAllowance/safeDecreaseAllowance where possible.
