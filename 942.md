# Double Application of Borrow Index in Liquidation logic

### Summary

The `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function incorrectly applies the borrow index twice when calculating the borrowed amount for liquidation checks. The `borrowed` parameter already includes the borrow index adjustment from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, but the function applies it again, leading to incorrect liquidation logic.

### Root Cause

In the [liquidateBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L230) function, the borrowed value is obtained via a call to [getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L238).

Inside getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral, the returned borrowed amount is already interest-accrued, due to the calculation in [total borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L425-#L428) as borrowWithInterestSame and borrowWithInterest already factor in index, meaning it reflects the current borrow balance with the borrow index already applied. 

This borrowed value is then passed to liquidateBorrowInternal, and subsequently into liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal.

However, within [liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347), the code mistakenly applies the borrow index again, assuming the borrowed value is still in raw principal form.

As a result, the borrow index is applied twice, artificially inflating the borrowedAmount and potentially causing healthy borrowers to appear undercollateralized

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The application of borrow index is applied twice will artificially inflating the borrowedAmount and potentially causing healthy borrowers to be undercollateralized leading to premature liquidations


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the line 

`borrowedAmount = borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;`

from the liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal().
