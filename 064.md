# Incorrect Collateral Check in Borrow Function

## Summary
The `borrow` function in the CoreRouter contract has a severe vulnerability in its collateral sufficiency check. The current logic only compares a user's collateral to their existing borrow balance, ignoring the additional amount they are requesting to borrow. This flaw enables users to borrow funds beyond what their collateral can support, resulting in under-collateralized loans. Such loans pose a significant financial risk to the protocol, as it may not recover the full borrowed amount during liquidation, potentially leading to losses and systemic instability.

## Finding Description
The `borrow` function in the CoreRouter contract includes a collateral check intended to ensure that a user's collateral is sufficient to cover their borrowing. The current implementation is as follows:
- The issue occured in [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L161)

```solidity
require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

Here, `collateral` represents the USD value of the user's deposited collateral, and `borrowAmount` represents the user's existing borrow balance in USD. However, this check is flawed because it does not consider the new borrow amount (`_amount`) that the user is requesting. When a user attempts to borrow additional funds, the check should verify that the collateral can support both the existing borrow balance **and** the new borrow amount. Instead, it only compares the collateral to the current borrow balance, allowing the total borrow (existing + new) to exceed the collateral value.

For instance:
- A user has $1000 in collateral and an existing borrow balance of $500.
- They request to borrow an additional $600.
- The check evaluates `$1000 >= $500`, which is true, so the borrow is approved.
- After the borrow, the total borrowed amount becomes $1100 ($500 + $600), which exceeds the $1000 collateral.

This oversight permits users to over-borrow, creating loans that are under-collateralized. If the user defaults or the collateral value drops, the protocol may be unable to recover the full borrowed amount during liquidation, leading to financial losses.

## Example
Consider the following detailed scenario:
- **User's collateral**: $1000 (in USD equivalent).
- **Existing borrow balance** (`borrowAmount`): $500.
- **New borrow request** (`_amount`): $600.

With the current implementation:
- The collateral check is `collateral >= borrowAmount`, or `$1000 >= $500`.
- This condition passes because $1000 is greater than $500.
- The additional $600 borrow is approved, increasing the user's total borrow to $1100 ($500 + $600).
- The collateral remains $1000, which is less than the total borrow of $1100.

In this case, the loan is under-collateralized by $100. If the user defaults and liquidation occurs, the protocol can only recover up to $1000 from the collateral, leaving a shortfall of $100 that the protocol cannot reclaim.

## Impact
This vulnerability has significant consequences for the protocol's financial health and stability:
- **Under-collateralized loans**: Users can borrow amounts that exceed their collateral's capacity, violating the protocol's intended loan-to-value (LTV) constraints.
- **Liquidation losses**: If a user defaults, the protocol may recover less than the borrowed amount, resulting in direct financial losses (e.g., the $100 shortfall in the example above).
- **Systemic risk**: If many users exploit this flaw, especially during volatile market conditions, the protocol could accumulate substantial unrecoverable debt, threatening its solvency and undermining user trust.

The severity of this issue is critical because it jeopardizes the protocol's core promise of maintaining adequately secured loans, potentially leading to cascading failures in extreme scenarios.

## Proof of Concept
To illustrate the vulnerability, consider this step-by-step demonstration:
1. A user deposits $1000 worth of collateral into the protocol.
2. The user borrows $500, which is well within the collateral limit ($1000 >= $500).
3. The user then requests an additional borrow of $600.
4. The current collateral check evaluates `$1000 >= $500` (existing borrow balance), which passes.
5. The $600 borrow is approved, raising the total borrowed amount to $1100 ($500 + $600).
6. The user's collateral remains $1000, meaning the loan is now under-collateralized by $100.
7. If the user defaults, liquidation of the $1000 collateral cannot cover the $1100 debt, resulting in a $100 loss to the protocol.

This scenario clearly demonstrates how the flawed check enables over-borrowing beyond the collateral's capacity.

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, the collateral sufficiency check must be revised to account for both the existing borrow balance and the new borrow amount. The corrected logic should ensure that the collateral is sufficient to cover the total borrow after the new amount is added. Assuming `borrowed` is the current borrow balance in USD and `_amount` is the new borrow amount, the updated check could be implemented as:

```solidity
require(collateral >= borrowed + _amount, "Insufficient collateral");
```

However, if `_amount` is provided in the borrowed token's native units (not USD), it must first be converted to USD using a reliable price oracle to ensure consistency with the `collateral` and `borrowed` values. The corrected code would then look like this:

```solidity
uint256 _amountInUSD = convertToUSD(_amount, borrowedToken);
require(collateral >= borrowed + _amountInUSD, "Insufficient collateral");
```
