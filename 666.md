# Missing Validation on Repay Amount Leading to Underflow Revert

### Title
Missing Validation on Repay Amount Leading to Underflow Revert

### Severity
Medium

### Impact
If a caller supplies an `_amount` greater than their outstanding debt (borrowedAmount), the subtraction `borrowedAmount – repayAmountFinal` underflows and reverts. This prevents legitimate full‐debt repayments from succeeding when the user over‐specifies the amount. As a result, borrowers cannot clear their loans, and liquidators might be blocked from fully resolving under‐collateralized positions.

### Type
Data Validation

### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol

## Description
In `repayBorrowInternal`, the code sets:
```solidity
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```
If `_amount` is any finite value greater than borrowedAmount, then `repayAmountFinal = _amount`. After calling `repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal)`, the branch:
```solidity
if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
    // fully cleared
    lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(...);
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(...);
} else {
    // partial‐repay path
    lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
        borrower,
        _lToken,
        borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal,  // ← underflow if repayAmountFinal > borrowedAmount
        LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
    );
}
```
executes the else path. Because `repayAmountFinal > borrowedAmount`, the subtraction underflows under Solidity 0.8’s built‐in checks, causing an immediate revert. Consequently, the entire repayment transaction fails even though the underlying `repayBorrow(...)` call likely succeeded in clearing the user’s debt.

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	Bob owes exactly 100 DAI on an LToken market.
	2.	Due to a small oracle or index rounding, his actual outstanding debt is reported as 100 DAI, but Bob’s wallet computes 101 DAI needed to be safe.
	3.	Bob calls repayBorrow(101, lTokenDAI).
	4.	Inside repayBorrowInternal, repayAmountFinal = 101 (since 101 ≠ max).
	5.	The LToken’s repayBorrow(101) call succeeds but caps at 100, wiping Bob’s debt.
	6.	Back in repayBorrowInternal, the code sees repayAmountFinal (101) != borrowedAmount (100), so it enters the else branch.
	7.	It executes uint256 newBalance = 100 – 101; which underflows and reverts.
	8.	The entire transaction rolls back—even though Bob’s debt was already paid—leaving Bob’s position unchanged on‐chain (still flagged as borrowed). Bob cannot recover unless he tries again with exactly 100, and any integration that automatically over‐estimates will continually fail.

## Recommendations
Before computing repayAmountFinal, add an explicit check to cap _amount at borrowedAmount, for example:
```solidity
require(_amount <= borrowedAmount || _amount == type(uint256).max, "Repay > total borrow");
uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
```
