# Missing _isSameChain check in repayBorrowInternal will cause incorrect debt tracking and potential double-counting of repayments

### Summary

A missing conditional check in the debt storage update logic will cause incorrect debt tracking for cross-chain borrowers as `CoreRouter` will update same-chain storage instead of cross-chain storage during cross-chain debt repayment.

### Root Cause

[`repayBorrowInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459) function correctly uses the `_isSameChain` flag to determine which debt amount to read, but fails to use this flag when updating the debt storage. The function always updates the same-chain `borrowBalance` mapping regardless of whether the repayment is for same-chain or cross-chain debt.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have an active cross-chain borrow position
2. The cross-chain borrow must be recorded in the `crossChainBorrows` mapping
3. The user must attempt to repay their cross-chain debt through the `repayBorrowInternal` function

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User A borrows tokens cross-chain from Chain A to Chain B
2. The borrow is recorded in `crossChainBorrows` mapping
3. User A attempts to repay their cross-chain debt
4. `repayBorrowInternal` is called with `_isSameChain = false`
5. Function correctly reads cross-chain debt amount using `borrowWithInterest`
6. Function incorrectly updates same-chain `borrowBalance` mapping instead of `crossChainBorrows`
7. This creates inconsistency between actual debt and recorded debt

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect debt tracking which can lead to double-counting of repayments and inability to accurately track cross-chain debt positions.

### PoC

1. Alice borrows 1000 USDC cross-chain from Chain A to Chain B. The borrow is recorded in `crossChainBorrows`.
2. When Alice attempts to repay 500 USDC of her cross-chain debt, the protocol incorrectly updates the same-chain `borrowBalance` mapping instead of the `crossChainBorrows` mapping. This creates a situation where Alice's cross-chain debt remains at 1000 USDC while a phantom 500 USDC debt appears in the same-chain storage.
3. Bob, who is monitoring the protocol's debt positions, would see incorrect debt records and potentially make wrong decisions based on this inaccurate data.

### Mitigation

The `repayBorrowInternal` function should be modified to use the `_isSameChain` flag when updating debt storage, ensuring cross-chain repayments update the `crossChainBorrows` mapping while same-chain repayments update the `borrowBalance` mapping.
