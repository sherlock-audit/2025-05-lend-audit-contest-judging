# Borrow limit check may be overly restrictive due to redundant interest scaling in borrow calculation.

### Summary

The protocol’s borrow function may prevent users from borrowing up to their true collateral limit because it applies interest scaling to a borrow amount that already includes accrued interest, resulting in an exaggerated borrow amount.

### Root Cause

In the `CoreRouter.borrow` function, the protocol checks if the user’s collateral is sufficient by calling `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which returns the user’s total borrow balance (including accrued interest) plus the new requested borrow. However, the code then further scales this borrowed value by the ratio of the current borrow index to the user’s stored borrow index. Since `borrowed` already reflects the up-to-date borrow balance with interest, this additional scaling is redundant and may double-count interest. Additionally, `borrowed` returns the value in USD and in 18 decimals, using it to calculate borrow amount will lead to issues when the actual token has different decimals. This logic can cause the protocol to overestimate the user’s borrow amount, making it harder for users to borrow up to their actual limit.

Another impact of this issue is that in case the borrower does not have any borrow locally(`currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0`), it sets `borrowAmount` to 0 and disregards the crosschain borrows. This way user can borrow more than allowed and will be immediately eligible for liquidation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User already has some borrow amount which is accruing interest.

### External Pre-conditions

The borrow index has changed since the user’s last borrow or interest accrual and now user wants to borrow some more.

### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral and attempts to borrow 2nd time, total borrow being close to their maximum allowed amount.
2. The protocol calculates the hypothetical borrow balance including the new borrow and accrued interest.
3. The protocol then applies an additional interest scaling, exaggerating the borrow amount.
4. The borrow is rejected even though the user’s collateral would be sufficient under correct calculations.

### Impact

Users may be unable to borrow up to their true collateral limit, reducing protocol usability and capital efficiency. The protocol is more conservative than necessary, which may frustrate users and reduce borrowing activity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the redundant interest scaling from the borrow limit check. Use the value returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral `directly, as it already includes the current borrow balance with interest and the new borrow.
