# collateral factors for the cross-chain lending protocol should be different

### Summary

The current protocol inherits LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios directly from a Compound fork, which was designed for **single-chain** lending and liquidation mechanisms. However, our protocol enables **cross-chain** borrowing and liquidation, which introduces significantly higher latency and execution risk during liquidations due to the nature of cross-chain messaging.

Because liquidation actions must occur across chains, delays in message delivery, transaction confirmation, and finality introduce potential  market volatility risk, especially during sharp price movements. Hence, using the same LTV thresholds as a single-chain system like Compound shouldn't be used for cross-chain lending.


Cross-chain operations can take several minutes. For example, the following LayerZero messages from Ethereum to Base took roughly **4 minutes** to relay:

- [Tx1: 0xedc789...821d](https://layerzeroscan.com/tx/0xedc789adbc0d1f400fff653f1f83e17fefdbe1eddec1952a38b2f0133e4d821d)
- [Tx2: 0xddf393...9197](https://layerzeroscan.com/tx/0xddf393272c7be0232a6d6c2aaa0708487dda1741b87f653b58ad8d25ef899197)

During these few minutes, asset prices may fluctuate, significantly affecting the position’s health. Thus, relying on tight LTV thresholds from Compound can result in liquidation failures, insolvency, or bad debt.

Also closeFactor should also be updated according to the projected risk.

### Root Cause

Compound’s original LTV values were calibrated assuming near-instant, atomic liquidations on the same chain. In contrast, our protocol’s cross-chain design introduces:

- Message relay delays between chains.
- Finality delays, especially from chains like Ethereum.
- Latency from executing transactions across two blockchains.

As a result, positions might not be liquidate on time , posing the risk of protocol insolvency (bad debts)

### Internal Pre-conditions

None  

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path
None

### Impact

Without this adjustment, the protocol:

- Increases the likelihood of failed or delayed liquidations.
- Exposes itself to bad debt due to under-collateralized loans.




### Recommendation

Adopt a **more conservative LTV threshold** tailored to cross-chain risk:

- Factor in average cross-chain message delivery time for each chain pair.
- Lower the LTV margin (e.g., from 75% to 65%) to provide sufficient buffer.
- Adjust LLTV (liquidation threshold) more aggressively for highly volatile assets or slower chains.
