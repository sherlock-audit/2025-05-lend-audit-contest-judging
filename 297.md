# New suppliers will retroactively receive unearned LEND rewards during their first supply

### Summary

The reward distribution logic will cause unearned LEND token rewards for new suppliers as any user will receive rewards for blocks they did not participate in, simply by supplying tokens once. This happens because `distributeSupplierLend()` uses the full delta in the global reward index even if the user has just entered the market.

### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol: 320, distributeSupplierLend()`, if a supplier’s index is uninitialized (i.e., `0`), the code forcefully sets their index to `LEND_INITIAL_INDEX` **after** calculating the reward delta between the global index and `0`. This incorrectly gives the supplier all prior unclaimed rewards.

```solidity
function distributeSupplierLend(address lToken, address supplier) external onlyAuthorized {
    // Trigger supply index update
    LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerSupplyIndexUpdate(lToken);

    // Get the appropriate lend state based on whether it's for supply or borrow
    (uint224 supplyIndex,) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).lendSupplyState(lToken);

    // Get the relevant indexes and accrued LEND for the account
    uint256 supplierIndex = lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier];

    lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier] = supplyIndex;

    // Update the account's index to the current index since we are distributing accrued LEND
    if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
320        supplierIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX;
    }

    // Calculate change in the cumulative sum of the LEND per lToken accrued
    Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(supplyIndex, supplierIndex)});

```

Because `supplierIndex` is still zero during reward calculation, `deltaIndex` becomes large, covering all past accrued blocks - even though the user was not supplying tokens during that time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user who has **never supplied** tokens to a given lToken market
2. The lToken market has accumulated LEND rewards (non-zero `lendSupplyState.index`)
3. The user supplies tokens for the **first time**

### External Pre-conditions

- There has been a time gap since the last reward claim, allowing reward index to increase
- A positive `lendSupplySpeed` is configured for the lToken

###  Attack Path

1. LEND rewards accumulate in an lToken market over multiple blocks
2. An attacker (or new user) supplies a small amount of tokens
3. `distributeSupplierLend()` is triggered
4. The user’s `supplierIndex` is zero, so the function calculates the delta from `0 → current index`
5. The user receives rewards as if they had held the tokens during the entire reward period=

###  Impact

- The user gains **LEND tokens they did not earn**, inflating their yield
- This can be repeated across tokens and markets
- This exploit can be **repeated across all supported lToken markets**, compounding the total loss.

### Mitigation

Ensure that `supplierIndex` is set **before** calculating reward deltas.  
Alternatively, skip reward distribution entirely if the supplier has never interacted before and just initialized their index.

```solidity
if (supplierIndex == 0) {
    lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier] = supplyIndex;
    return; // skip reward until next interaction
}
```

This defers rewards until the user has accrued them genuinely.
