# `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` has a flaw in which it takes the mantissa close factor from the borrowed amount without the interest

### Summary

`liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` has the flaw [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L344-L355) in which it takes the `maxClose` number only from the borrowed amount itself excluding interest as it can be seen in `borrowBalance.amount`.

This creates a flawed validation in which the `maxRepay` amount excludes the interest, thus reverting when the liquidator sends the borrowed amount + the interest accrued in order to close the position in a normal and expected way.

### Root Cause

Root cause is that calculating the `maxClose` doesn't include the interest which will leave to a premature revert and the inability for a full closure of the position.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Accrued interest 

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice borrows $900 with $1000
2. Alice has a debt of $950 and collateral has fallen just below min CR
3. Bob won't be able to liquidate her position because he'll get a revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L357C38-L357) due to the `maxClose` not including interest

### Impact

Broken functionality + worsening of protocol health - depending on the judge and some constraints but it is a high IMO

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the interest in `maxClose` calculation
