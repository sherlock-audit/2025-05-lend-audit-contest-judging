# Reward Distribution to Borrower Despite Failed Borrow Execution

### Summary

In the _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest function, the protocol attempts to execute a cross-chain borrow by calling an external contract function borrowForCrossChain on the CoreRouter. Immediately after this call, the function distributes LEND rewards to the borrower regardless of whether the borrow succeeded or failed.

If the external borrow call fails silently (i.e., returns false or otherwise does not revert the transaction), the borrow is not actually executed on the CoreRouter contract, but the borrower still receives rewards. This creates a state inconsistency where rewards are given for a borrow that did not occur.

### Root Cause

In crossChainBorrow.sol (line where borrowForCrossChain is called), there is no validation of the external callâ€™s success. The function immediately proceeds to distribute borrower rewards, assuming the borrow succeeded. If borrowForCrossChain fails silently (returns false or swallows errors), the protocol still issues rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain call must fail silently (no revert, returns false or does nothing).

The borrow request passes pre-collateral checks to reach the borrow execution step.

Borrower has approved and initiated a borrow request through _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest.

### External Pre-conditions

External CoreRouter contract is deployed and callable.

Underlying token contracts function as expected (interest accrual, borrow index).

LayerZero messaging and cross-chain environment deliver the borrow payload correctly.

### Attack Path

Borrower initiates a cross-chain borrow through _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest.

CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain fails silently (does not revert).

Despite failure, lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend is called, awarding rewards.

Borrower obtains LEND rewards without corresponding debt or risk.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an economic loss as LEND tokens are distributed for non-existent debt. Borrowers gain rewards unfairly, diluting the reward pool and potentially destabilizing protocol incentives.

### Mitigation

Check return value: If borrowForCrossChain returns a boolean indicating success, explicitly check it and revert on failure.

bool success = CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(...);
require(success, "Borrow execution failed");

// Now distribute rewards safely
lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(payload.destlToken, payload.sender);
