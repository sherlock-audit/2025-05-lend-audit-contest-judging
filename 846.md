# Use a safe transfer helper library for ERC20 transfers

### Summary

Since the IERC20 interface requires a boolean return value, attempting to transfer ERC20s with [missing return values](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values) will revert. This means CoreRouter contract cannot support a number of popular ERC20s, including USDT.

### Root Cause


```solidity
    function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");


        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");


        require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");


        IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    }
```
