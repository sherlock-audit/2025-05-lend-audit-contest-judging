# CrossChainRouter will cause inaccurate collateral or borrow assessments for users

### Summary

The lack of complete interest accrual updates will cause inaccurate borrow/lend assessments for users as CrossChainRouter functions call getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() without first accruing all relevant lTokens, leading to incorrect collateral or debt values during cross-chain borrowing or liquidation validation.

### Root Cause

In CrossChainRouter.sol, the [borrowCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L154), [_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L581-L673), and [_checkLiquidationValid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431-L436) functions rely on LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() without first accruing interest on all relevant lTokens. Since getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() uses exchangeRateStored() and borrowIndex() (both of which are stale unless accrueInterest() is called), the resulting collateral or borrow values may be inaccurate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have a non-zero balance in at least one lToken that has not recently had accrueInterest() called.

2. User must be interacting via borrowCrossChain() or be the subject of _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest or _checkLiquidationValid.



### External Pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have experienced a block delay since the last accrueInterest() was called on at least one lToken.

2. Oracle prices remain unchanged during this delay (to isolate the error to exchange rate drift).



### Attack Path

borrowCrossChain() (source chain):
1. A user has supplied multiple lTokens as collateral.

2. Only accrueInterest() is called on the lToken corresponding to _borrowToken.

3. The function calls getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() to calculate total collateral.

4. Due to stale exchangeRateStored() on other lTokens, collateral is underestimated.

5. Borrow request is incorrectly denied, causing user-facing failure (false negative).

- Alternatively, if exchange rates decrease, collateral may be overstated (false positive).

_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest() (destination chain):
1. The function receives payload.collateral from the source chain and checks if it is sufficient.

2. Calls getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() to get totalBorrowed, without accruing userBorrowedAssets.

3. Underestimated borrow value allows borrow to proceed when it should not.

_checkLiquidationValid() (source chain):
1. A liquidator attempts to liquidate an undercollateralized borrower.

2. Function calls getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() without accruing either supplied or borrowed lTokens.

3. The borrower appears overcollateralized due to outdated values and liquidation is blocked.

### Impact

- In borrowCrossChain(), users may be wrongly denied a borrow or overborrow if stale values are favorable.

- In _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(), users may borrow more than allowed if debt is understated.

- In _checkLiquidationValid(), liquidations that should succeed are incorrectly blocked.

- Affected parties: users, lenders, liquidators.

- The protocol risks loss via:

     - Missed liquidations

     - Underpriced borrows

     - User disruption

     - Potential accumulation of bad debt

### Mitigation

In borrowCrossChain():
```solidity
address[] memory supplied = lendStorage.getUserSuppliedAssets(msg.sender);
for (uint256 i = 0; i < supplied.length; ++i) {
    LTokenInterface(supplied[i]).accrueInterest();
}
```
In _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest():
```solidity
address[] memory borrowed = lendStorage.getUserBorrowedAssets(payload.sender);
for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowed.length; ++i) {
    LTokenInterface(borrowed[i]).accrueInterest();
}
```
In _checkLiquidationValid():
```solidity
address[] memory supplied = lendStorage.getUserSuppliedAssets(payload.sender);
for (uint256 i = 0; i < supplied.length; ++i) {
    LTokenInterface(supplied[i]).accrueInterest();
}

address[] memory borrowed = lendStorage.getUserBorrowedAssets(payload.sender);
for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowed.length; ++i) {
    LTokenInterface(borrowed[i]).accrueInterest();
}
```
