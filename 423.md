# Incorrect Repayment Amount in LiquidationSuccess Message Handling

**Summary:** When processing a `LiquidationSuccess` message on Chain B, the contract incorrectly uses the amount of collateral seized on Chain A as the amount of debt repaid on Chain B.

**Vulnerability Detail:** After a successful liquidation execution on Chain A, a `LiquidationSuccess` message is sent back to Chain B. This message's `payload.amount` contains the quantity of collateral tokens that were seized on Chain A (which was originally sent from Chain B as `seizeTokens`). The `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function on Chain B then calls `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` using this `payload.amount` as the repayment amount (`_amount`). The actual repayment amount should be the quantity of borrowed tokens repaid by the liquidator on Chain B.

**Impact:** The borrower's debt on Chain B is reduced by an amount corresponding to the quantity of collateral seized on Chain A, not the quantity of borrowed tokens actually repaid on Chain B. Due to cross-chain price differences and fluctuations, these quantities represent vastly different values. This leads to incorrect debt accounting for the borrower on Chain B, potentially over-reducing or under-reducing their debt.

**Recommendation:** The `LiquidationSuccess` message should include the actual amount of borrowed tokens repaid by the liquidator on Chain B. Alternatively, the liquidation process needs to be redesigned to correctly track and apply the repayment amount on Chain B and the seized collateral on Chain A as separate, value-equivalent operations.
