# USDT ERC20 transfer handling could break core functionality

### Summary

Some ERC-20 tokens, like USDT on Ethereum, do not return a boolean value for transfer() and approve(), deviating from the official ERC-20 standard. When a contract uses the standard IERC20 interface (which expects a bool return), calls to these tokens revert because Solidity tries to decode a non-existent return value.



### Root Cause

> If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
Whitelisted only (e.g BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT). ERC20 standard.

The protocol explicitly mentions that it would support USDT. However, some tokens do not return a bool (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) on ERC20 methods like `transfer`. This will make the call break, making it impossible to use these tokens.
```solidity
// // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```
This means that the solidity call to USDT on Ethereum Mainnet will revert when attempting to decode
return value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Supports USDT

### External Pre-conditions

Attempts a transaction with USDT

### Attack Path

This occurs in USDT transactions on Ethereum mainnet due to improper handling of the return values.

### Impact

1. Breaks core functionality like `redeem`, `borrow` and `borrowFromCrossChain` in `CoreRouter.sol`
2. Leads to slilent failures or unintended reverts.
3. Failure to Support USDT.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `safeTransfer` instead of `Transfer`.
