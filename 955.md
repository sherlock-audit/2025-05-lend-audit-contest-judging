# Logical Error in Cross-Chain Debt Calculation Enables Unlimited Borrowing Beyond Collateral Capacity

### Summary

The protocol's cross-chain debt tracking mechanism contains a critical logical error in its debt calculation. The function requires both source and destination chain IDs to equal the current chain ID for cross-chain borrows to be included in the debt calculation. This condition is logically impossible to satisfy in a cross-chain context, as source and destination chains must be different. As a result, legitimate cross-chain borrows are never included in the user's total debt calculation, allowing malicious users to repeatedly borrow assets across chains without their total debt being tracked. This oversight effectively enables unlimited borrowing beyond collateral capacity, completely bypassing the protocol's risk management system and putting all user funds at risk.

### Root Cause

In [`LendStorage:borrowWithInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478), the debt calculation mechanism contains a critical logical error in how it handles cross-chain borrows. The function attempts to track both local borrows and cross-chain borrows, but the condition for including cross-chain collateral borrows is fundamentally flawed. 

The vulnerability stems from the requirement that both `srcEid` and `destEid` must equal `currentEid` for a collateral borrow to be included in the debt calculation. This is logically impossible in a cross-chain context because:
1. For any cross-chain operation, `srcEid` and `destEid` must be different (they represent different chains)
2. `currentEid` can only be one of these values (the current chain)
3. Therefore, it's impossible for both `srcEid` and `destEid` to equal `currentEid` simultaneously

This means that legitimate cross-chain borrows are never included in the debt calculation, allowing users to borrow multiple times without their total debt being properly tracked.

```solidity
// VULNERABILITY: This condition is logically impossible for cross-chain borrows
// For a cross-chain borrow:
// - srcEid and destEid must be different
// - currentEid can only be one of them
// Therefore, this condition will never be true for legitimate cross-chain borrows
if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
    borrowedAmount +=
        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have sufficient liquidity on the source chain for the attacker to borrow from
2. Protocol must have sufficient collateral on the destination chain for the attacker to supply

### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero must be operational and able to process cross-chain messages

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies the logical error in debt calculation
2. Attacker supplies collateral on Chain A
3. Attacker initiates a cross-chain borrow from Chain A to Chain B
4. Due to the incorrect condition, the borrow is not properly tracked in the debt calculation
5. Attacker repeats steps 3-4 multiple times, each time borrowing more than their collateral should allow
6. Attacker can now borrow unlimited amounts beyond their collateral capacity

### Impact

The protocol suffers an unbounded loss as attackers can borrow unlimited amounts beyond their collateral capacity. The protocol's risk parameters are effectively bypassed, leading to potential insolvency and loss of user funds. The attacker gains access to borrowed funds without proper collateral backing, while the protocol and its users bear the risk of these unbacked loans.

### PoC

```solidity
// Alice's attack scenario
1. Alice supplies 1000 USDC as collateral on Chain A
2. Alice initiates a cross-chain borrow of 500 USDC from Chain A to Chain B
   - This borrow is not properly tracked due to the incorrect condition
3. Alice repeats the cross-chain borrow multiple times
   - Each borrow is not properly tracked in the debt calculation
4. Alice can now borrow unlimited amounts beyond her 1000 USDC collateral
5. If the protocol has sufficient liquidity, Alice could potentially borrow millions of USDC with only 1000 USDC collateral
```

### Mitigation

The condition in `borrowWithInterest` should be modified to properly track cross-chain borrows by checking if the borrow originated on the current chain (for borrows) or if the collateral is held on the current chain (for collaterals), rather than requiring both source and destination to be the current chain.
