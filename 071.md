# Incorrect Native Fee Payment in LayerZero Send Leads to Massive Overpayment and Protocol Fund Depletion

## Description

The `CrossChainRouter` implementation in the Lend-V2 protocol is vulnerable to excessive native fee payments when sending LayerZero messages. By using the entire contract balance (`address(this).balance`) as the native fee for all cross-chain messages, the protocol drastically overpays for transactions, rapidly depletes funds, and risks message rejection by LayerZero endpoints due to abnormally high fees. This can lead to service disruption, fund waste, and cross-chain functionality failures.

## Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the protocol's incorrect fee payment mechanism when initiating LayerZero cross-chain messages, without using the LayerZero endpoint's fee quoting mechanism.

### Internal Pre-Conditions

* The `_send` function uses the entire contract balance as the native fee for LayerZero messages
📍 **Location in Code:** [`CrossChainRouter.sol#L804-L821`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L804-L821)

```solidity
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }
```

* The code does not use the recommended fee quoting pattern with `lzEndpoint.quote()` 
* No safeguards against overpayment or excessive fees

### External Pre-Conditions

* Contract has accumulated ETH balance over time
* Multiple cross-chain operations are needed to maintain protocol functionality
* No refund mechanism to reclaim excess payments

## Impact

When the protocol performs cross-chain operations using LayerZero, it incurs substantial financial losses and operational issues. Our PoC demonstrates that this issue leads to:

1. **Massive Overpayment**: The contract pays up to 500x more than necessary for cross-chain messages (e.g., 5 ETH instead of 0.01 ETH)
2. **Rapid Fund Depletion**: What should support 500+ cross-chain operations gets depleted after just 1 transaction
3. **Potential Message Rejection**: Extremely large fees may be rejected by LayerZero endpoints as suspicious or exceeding internal limits
4. **Operational Failure**: After fund depletion, critical cross-chain operations become impossible

The vulnerability can affect all cross-chain functionality in the protocol, including:

> **Note:** This vulnerability has an immediate financial impact by wasting protocol funds, but also severe operational impacts by potentially disrupting cross-chain liquidations, borrows, and other essential protocol functions after funds are depleted.

## Proof of Concept

The complete PoC stored in `test/poc/PocIncorrectNativeFeePayment.t.sol` demonstrates how the incorrect fee payment mechanism leads to massive overpayment and rapid fund depletion.

```

The test results demonstrate:

### Overpayment Analysis
- **✅ Initial Balance**: 5 ETH in the contract
- **✅ Realistic Fee**: 0.01 ETH for a typical LayerZero message
- **❌ Buggy Fee**: Uses entire 5 ETH balance (499x overpayment)
- **❌ Overpayment**: 4.99 ETH wasted per transaction (49,900% excess)

### Resource Efficiency Impact
- **✅ Proper Implementation**: Supports ~500 cross-chain operations
- **❌ Buggy Implementation**: Supports only 1 operation before depletion
- **❌ Efficiency Loss**: 99% of funds wasted

### Endpoint Rejection Risk
- **❌ Extreme Scenario**: 1000 ETH attempted fee
- **❌ Reasonable Limit**: Exceeds reasonable fee by 1000x
- **❌ Rejection Risk**: High probability of message rejection

## Mitigation

Based on the PoC that successfully demonstrates the vulnerability, we recommend the following comprehensive fixes:

### 1. Primary Fix - Use LayerZero Fee Quoting

```solidity
function _send(
    uint32 _eid,
    bytes memory _receiver,
    bytes memory _message,
    bytes memory _options
) private {
    // Get the proper fee quote from LayerZero endpoint
    (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 lzTokenFee) = lzEndpoint.quote(
        _eid,
        _message,
        _options,
        false
    );
    
    // Verify the contract has sufficient balance
    require(address(this).balance >= nativeFee, "Insufficient balance for LZ fee");
    
    // Send with the properly quoted fee amount
    _lzSend(
        _eid,
        _message,
        _receiver,
        MessagingFee(nativeFee, lzTokenFee),
        payable(msg.sender),
        _options
    );
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Protection - Fee Limits and Validation

```solidity
// Add constants for fee limits
uint256 private constant MAX_LZ_FEE = 0.5 ether; // 0.5 ETH max fee
uint256 private constant MIN_LZ_FEE = 0.001 ether; // 0.001 ETH min fee

function _send(
    uint32 _eid,
    bytes memory _receiver,
    bytes memory _message,
    bytes memory _options
) private {
    // Get the proper fee quote
    (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 lzTokenFee) = lzEndpoint.quote(
        _eid,
        _message,
        _options,
        false
    );
    
    // Validate fee is within reasonable limits
    require(nativeFee >= MIN_LZ_FEE, "Fee quote suspiciously low");
    require(nativeFee <= MAX_LZ_FEE, "Fee quote exceeds maximum allowed");
    
    // Check contract has sufficient balance
    require(address(this).balance >= nativeFee, "Insufficient balance for LZ fee");
    
    // Send with validated fee
    _lzSend(
        _eid,
        _message,
        _receiver,
        MessagingFee(nativeFee, lzTokenFee),
        payable(msg.sender),
        _options
    );
}
```

### 3. Fee Management System - Advanced Protection

```solidity
// Add fee management state variables
mapping(uint32 => uint256) public lastFeeByChainId;
mapping(uint32 => uint256) public feeUpdateTimestamp;
uint256 public constant MAX_FEE_INCREASE_PCT = 200; // 200% max increase
uint256 public constant FEE_VALID_PERIOD = 1 hours;

function _send(
    uint32 _eid,
    bytes memory _receiver,
    bytes memory _message,
    bytes memory _options
) private {
    // Get the proper fee quote
    (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 lzTokenFee) = lzEndpoint.quote(
        _eid,
        _message,
        _options,
        false
    );
    
    // Protect against sudden fee spikes (potential oracle manipulation)
    if (lastFeeByChainId[_eid] > 0) {
        uint256 maxAllowedFee = lastFeeByChainId[_eid] * (100 + MAX_FEE_INCREASE_PCT) / 100;
        
        // If fee increases dramatically, require confirmation unless fee data is stale
        if (nativeFee > maxAllowedFee && 
            block.timestamp - feeUpdateTimestamp[_eid] < FEE_VALID_PERIOD) {
            revert("Fee increase exceeds safety threshold");
        }
    }
    
    // Update fee tracking data
    lastFeeByChainId[_eid] = nativeFee;
    feeUpdateTimestamp[_eid] = block.timestamp;
    
    // Send with protected fee
    _lzSend(
        _eid,
        _message,
        _receiver,
        MessagingFee(nativeFee, lzTokenFee),
        payable(msg.sender),
        _options
    );
}
```

### 4. Emergency Failsafe - Manual Fee Control

```solidity
// Add governance control for emergencies
bool public useManualFeeMode;
mapping(uint32 => uint256) public manualFees;
address public admin;

modifier onlyAdmin() {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Not authorized");
    _;
}

// Allow governance to set manual fees in case of LayerZero issues
function setManualFee(uint32 _eid, uint256 _fee) external onlyAdmin {
    manualFees[_eid] = _fee;
}

function toggleManualFeeMode(bool _enabled) external onlyAdmin {
    useManualFeeMode = _enabled;
}

function _send(
    uint32 _eid,
    bytes memory _receiver,
    bytes memory _message,
    bytes memory _options
) private {
    uint256 nativeFee;
    uint256 lzTokenFee;
    
    if (useManualFeeMode && manualFees[_eid] > 0) {

## Conclusion

The Lend-V2 protocol contains an **Incorrect Native Fee Payment** vulnerability in the LayerZero integration that has been proven through comprehensive PoC testing. This vulnerability leads to massive overpayment for cross-chain messages, rapid depletion of protocol funds, and potential message rejection by LayerZero endpoints.

The root cause is the improper use of `address(this).balance` as the native fee for every LayerZero message, instead of properly quoting the required fee amount. This results in a 99% efficiency loss, with the protocol being able to perform only 1 cross-chain operation instead of 500 with the same amount of funds.
