# Missing LToken Validation in borrow Function in CoreRouter.sol Bypasses Liquidity Check, Enabling Potential Theft of Contract-Held Tokens

### Summary

The `borrow` function in `CoreRouter.sol` fails to validate that the `_lToken` (derived from the user-supplied `_token`) is a supported market (i.e., not `address(0)`). This will cause impact: a bypass of the core liquidity check for the new borrow amount, potentially allowing theft of any ERC20 tokens held by the `CoreRouter` contract for the LEND protocol and its Treasury/funds held in `CoreRouter`. This occurs as a malicious user will call `borrow` with an unsupported `_token` address. This results in `_lToken` becoming `address(0)`. The subsequent call to `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` with this zero address `_lToken` (as `lTokenModify`) causes the function to skip accounting for the `_amount` being borrowed in its solvency calculations. If other checks are weak or also compromised by the zero address, and `CoreRouter` holds the specified `_token`, the final `transfer` of `_token` to the user can occur without proper collateralization for this specific borrow operation.

### Root Cause

- In `CoreRouter.sol`, within the `borrow` function, after deriving `_lToken` from the user-provided `_token`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145-L148
```solidity
  function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
      require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

      address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);
      // MISSING CHECK HERE: require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");
      // ...
  }
```
The missing require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token"); check allows the function to proceed with _lToken as address(0) if an unsupported _token is supplied.

This subsequently affects the call to lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount). Inside getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral, when lTokenModify (which is _lToken from borrow) is address(0), the crucial block of code intended to add the new borrowAmount to vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects is skipped:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L444-L464
```solidity
// Inside LendStorage.sol/getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral
if (address(lTokenModify) != address(0)) { // This condition becomes false if _lToken is address(0)
    // ...
    // Add effect of new borrow
    if (borrowAmount > 0) { // borrowAmount is the _amount from CoreRouter.borrow
        vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects =
            mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, borrowAmount, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);
    }
    // This entire block is skipped if lTokenModify is address(0).
}
```
As a result, the `_amount` the user intends to borrow is not factored into the liquidity calculation performed by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The `CoreRouter.sol` contract holds a balance of an ERC20 token (`X_TOKEN`). This `X_TOKEN` is *not* registered as a supported underlying asset for any LToken market in `LendStorage.sol` (i.e., `lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(X_TOKEN_ADDRESS)` returns `address(0)`). This token could be the protocol's native LEND token held by the router for other purposes, or any other token erroneously sent to or held by the router.
2.  The `enterMarkets(address(0))` call (which would be `enterMarkets(_lToken)` where `_lToken` is `address(0)`) within the `borrow` function does not revert. This depends on the `Lendtroller`'s implementation of `enterMarkets`; a robust `Lendtroller` should ideally revert if an invalid market like `address(0)` is passed. If `enterMarkets(address(0))` reliably reverts, this specific attack vector is blocked at that stage.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  An attacker (user) identifies an ERC20 token (`X_TOKEN`) that is held by the `CoreRouter.sol` contract and for which `lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(X_TOKEN_ADDRESS)` returns `address(0)`.
2.  The attacker calls the `CoreRouter.borrow` function with the address of `X_TOKEN` and an amount they wish to steal.


### Attack Path

1.  An attacker identifies an ERC20 token, `X_TOKEN`, held by the `CoreRouter.sol` contract. `X_TOKEN` is not a supported underlying asset for any LToken market (i.e., `lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(X_TOKEN_ADDRESS)` returns `address(0)`).
2.  The attacker calls `CoreRouter.borrow(_amount_to_steal, X_TOKEN_ADDRESS)`, where `_amount_to_steal` is less than or equal to the `CoreRouter`'s balance of `X_TOKEN`.
3.  Inside the `borrow` function:
    a.  `_lToken` is set to `address(0)` because `X_TOKEN_ADDRESS` is not found in `lendStorage.underlyingTolToken`.
    b.  The crucial check `require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");` is missing.
    c.  `LTokenInterface(address(0)).accrueInterest()` is called. This does not revert and has no effect.
    d.  `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(address(0))), 0, _amount_to_steal)` is invoked. Because `lTokenModify` (which is `_lToken`) is `address(0)`, the internal logic block within `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` that should add the `_amount_to_steal` to `sumBorrowPlusEffects` is skipped. Consequently, the returned `borrowed` value only reflects the attacker's pre-existing debts (if any), and `collateral` reflects their pre-existing collateral. The new `_amount_to_steal` is not accounted for in this primary solvency check.
    e.  The secondary (and generally flawed) liquidity check within `borrow` is performed:
        i.  `LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, address(0));` results in `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` being `0`.
        ii. `uint256 borrowAmount_local_var = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 ? (...) : 0;` sets `borrowAmount_local_var` to `0`.
        iii. `require(collateral >= borrowAmount_local_var, "Insufficient collateral");` effectively becomes `require(collateral >= 0, "Insufficient collateral");`. This check passes if the attacker has any collateral or even zero collateral (if `collateral` can be `0`), as it does not consider the `_amount_to_steal`.
    f.  `enterMarkets(address(0))` is called. If this call does not revert (a key condition for the exploit's success), execution continues.
    g.  `require(LErc20Interface(address(0)).borrow(_amount_to_steal) == 0, "Borrow failed");` is called. A call to the `borrow` function on `address(0)` typically returns default values (e.g., `0` for `uint`), causing this `require` statement to pass. No actual tokens are dispensed from an LToken pool.
    h.  `IERC20(X_TOKEN_ADDRESS).transfer(msg.sender, _amount_to_steal);` is executed. If `CoreRouter.sol` has a sufficient balance of `X_TOKEN`, this transfer succeeds, and the attacker receives `_amount_to_steal` of `X_TOKEN`.
4.  The attacker has successfully withdrawn `X_TOKEN` from the `CoreRouter` contract without providing adequate collateral for this specific borrow, as the liquidity checks for this operation were effectively bypassed.
5.  Subsequent calls to `LendStorage` (e.g., `distributeBorrowerLend`, `updateBorrowBalance`) will use `_lToken = address(0)`, potentially writing junk data or corrupting storage state for keys involving `address(0)`, though the attacker has already received the funds.


### Impact

* An attacker can **steal any ERC20 tokens (`X_TOKEN`) held by the `CoreRouter.sol` contract, provided that `X_TOKEN` is not registered as a supported underlying asset (allowing `_lToken` to become `address(0)`) AND the `enterMarkets(address(0))` call within the `borrow` flow does not reliably revert.**
* The vulnerability allows bypassing the core collateralization checks for a borrow operation. The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function fails to account for the amount being borrowed when `lTokenModify` is `address(0)`, and the subsequent secondary liquidity check is also rendered ineffective.
* This can lead to a direct loss of funds from the `CoreRouter` contract. The affected party is the LEND protocol (specifically, any funds like protocol fees, undistributed LEND tokens, or other assets held by `CoreRouter`).
