# Attackers can manipulate protocol's risk calculations by exploiting unchecked oracle prices

### Summary

Missing oracle price validation in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` will allow manipulation of collateral/borrow calculations as zero or invalid prices are not rejected, enabling users to bypass core risk controls.

### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol` contract, the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function does not validate that [oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L407) prices are non-zero, unlike Compound V2's [implementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/Lendtroller.sol#L806C13-L809C14) in Lendtroller.sol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Oracle must return a zero price for any asset
2. User must have positions in the affected market
3. Function must be called through CoreRouter's risk checks

### External Pre-conditions

Oracle price feed must be compromised or return zero

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies asset with zero/manipulated oracle price
2. Calls functions in `CoreRouter` that rely on `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`: borrow(), redeem(), liquidateBorrow()
3. Zero prices cause incorrect collateral/borrow calculations
4. Attacker can:
- Borrow more than collateral allows
- Redeem collateral that should be locked
- Avoid liquidation when underwater
- Liquidate healthy positions


### Impact

Attackers can completely bypass protocol's risk management system. This allows:

- Excessive borrowing against worthless collateral
- Withdrawal of collateral that should be locked
- Prevention of legitimate liquidations
- Unauthorized liquidations of healthy positions 
- The protocol could become insolvent due to unchecked bad debts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add price validation similar to Compound V2:
```diff
function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...) {
    // For each asset calculation:
    vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset);
+    if (vars.oraclePriceMantissa == 0) {
+       return (0, 0); // Signal price error
+   }
    // ...
}
```
