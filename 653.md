# maxClose Calculation in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal Uses Stale Principal, Unduly Restricting Liquidation Repayment Amount

### Summary

In `CoreRouter.sol`'s `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, when handling liquidations for non-deprecated markets, {root cause: the `maxClose` variable (maximum portion of a specific debt a liquidator can repay, determined by `closeFactor`) is calculated based on `borrowBalance.amount`. This `borrowBalance.amount` represents the principal of the specific same-chain debt recorded at the user's last interaction and does not include interest accrued since that update}. This will cause an {impact: underestimation of the truly permissible repayment amount, thereby hindering liquidators from repaying the intended portion (e.g., 50%) of the *current actual debt including interest*} for {affected party: the LEND protocol (as risk is not reduced as effectively) and liquidators (as their ability to perform meaningful liquidations is hampered)}. This occurs when {actor: a liquidator attempts to liquidate the maximum allowed portion of an undercollateralized debt} as {vulnerability path: `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` calculates `maxClose` using the stale principal. If the liquidator attempts to repay an amount based on the current total debt (principal + interest) multiplied by the `closeFactor`, this amount will likely exceed the miscalculated `maxClose`, causing the `require(repayAmount <= maxClose)` check to fail and block/restrict the liquidation}.


### Root Cause

- In `CoreRouter.sol`, within the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, specifically in the `else` block (for non-deprecated markets), the calculation of `maxClose`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L353-L357
```solidity
  // Inside the 'else' block for non-deprecated markets:
  // ... (after the flawed shortfall check)
  uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
      Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}),
      borrowBalance.amount // Flaw: This is stale principal, excludes accrued interest
  );
  require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
```

The `closeFactorMantissa` (e.g., 50%) from `lendtroller` is applied to `borrowBalance.amount`. `borrowBalance.amount` is the principal amount for the `lTokenBorrowed` market stored in `LendStorage` from the borrower's last interaction (e.g., last borrow or repay). It does not include any interest that has accrued on this principal since that last update. The `closeFactor` should correctly be applied to the current total outstanding value (**principal + interest**) of the specific `lTokenBorrowed` debt to determine the maximum repayable portion.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `borrower` has an active same-chain borrow position in a non-deprecated LToken market (`lTokenBorrowed`). Their `LendStorage.borrowBalance[borrower][lTokenBorrowed].amount` is `P_old` (this is the principal recorded at the last update for this specific borrow).
2.  The `LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))` function returns `false`.
3.  Interest has accrued on `P_old` for the `borrower` in the `lTokenBorrowed` market, such that their current actual outstanding debt for this specific market is `D_current = P_old + Interest_accrued` (where `Interest_accrued > 0`). This `D_current` is the value that `lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lTokenBorrowed)` would return after interest accrual for `lTokenBorrowed`.
4.  The `LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()` returns a valid close factor (e.g., `0.5 * 1e18` for 50%).
5.  It is assumed that the `borrower`'s account is liquidatable and has passed any preceding overall shortfall checks necessary to reach this part of the logic in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`. (This report focuses specifically on the `maxClose` calculation, assuming other conditions for liquidation are met).


### External Pre-conditions

1.  A `liquidator` calls `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow`, which eventually calls `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`.
2.  The `liquidator` intends to repay an amount `repayAmount`. For testing this specific flaw, the `repayAmount` chosen would ideally be `closeFactor * D_current` (i.e., the maximum permissible amount based on the *actual* current debt of `lTokenBorrowed` and the protocol's `closeFactor`).


### Attack Path

*(This describes a failure path for a legitimate liquidation repayment amount due to the bug)*
1.  A `borrower` has an outstanding same-chain loan in a non-deprecated market, `lTokenBorrowed`. The principal amount last recorded in `LendStorage` for this specific borrow (via `borrowBalance.amount`) is `P_old`.
2.  Due to accrued interest, the borrower's actual current outstanding debt in `lTokenBorrowed` is `D_current = P_old + I`, where `I` represents the accrued interest (`I > 0`).
3.  A `liquidator` determines the borrower's position is liquidatable (passes overall shortfall checks) and wishes to repay the maximum allowed portion for this specific `lTokenBorrowed` debt. The correct maximum repayable portion according to the `closeFactor` (e.g., 50%) would be `TargetRepayAmount = closeFactor * D_current`.
4.  The liquidator calls `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow` with `repayAmount = TargetRepayAmount`. This eventually calls `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`.
5.  Inside `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` (non-deprecated market path), after any primary shortfall check, `maxClose` is calculated as:
    `maxClose_calculated = closeFactor * P_old` (because it uses `borrowBalance.amount` which is `P_old`).
6.  The check `require(repayAmount <= maxClose_calculated, "Too much repay");` is performed.
7.  This translates to `require((closeFactor * (P_old + I)) <= (closeFactor * P_old), "Too much repay");`.
8.  Since `I > 0` (interest has accrued), `closeFactor * (P_old + I)` will be greater than `closeFactor * P_old`.
9.  Therefore, the `require` statement fails, and the transaction reverts.
10. The liquidator is prevented from repaying the actual maximum allowed portion of the debt for `lTokenBorrowed` as per the protocol's `closeFactor` when applied to the current debt. They are incorrectly restricted to repaying at most `closeFactor * P_old`.


### Impact

* Liquidators are **unduly restricted in the amount they can repay** for an undercollateralized position in non-deprecated markets. The `maxClose` (maximum repayable portion of a debt) is calculated based on a stale principal (`borrowBalance.amount`) which does not include accrued interest, rather than being based on the current, actual outstanding debt for that specific market.
* This leads to **less effective liquidations**. A smaller portion of the risky debt is cleared in a single liquidation transaction than what the protocol's `closeFactor` intends to allow based on the true current debt.
* The borrower's position remains riskier than necessary after such an artificially restricted liquidation. This might necessitate multiple, smaller, and potentially less gas-efficient liquidation events to adequately de-risk the position, or it may leave the protocol exposed to the remaining risky portion of the debt for a longer period.
* This can reduce the incentive for liquidators if the repayable amount is too small to make the liquidation profitable after considering transaction costs and the value of seized collateral (as the value of seized collateral is proportional to the `repayAmount`).
* Overall, this **weakens the protocol's risk management framework** by hampering the efficiency and intended depth of single liquidation actions.
