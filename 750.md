# Incorrect fee management in CrossChainRouter

### Summary

Sending the entire contract balance for every cross-chain message will cause a severe DoS condition for users as concurrent transactions will drain the contract's balance and lead to failed operations. 

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter`, the [_send ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820)function uses the entire contract balance for each message:

```solidity
_lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
```

This is problematic because:
1. It doesn't calculate the actual required fee
2. It uses the entire contract balance regardless of the actual fee needed
3. It can lead to failures if multiple transactions are processed in the same block

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `CrossChainRouter` contract must have a non-zero ETH balance
2. At least two users must attempt to perform cross-chain operations in the same block or in quick succession

### External Pre-conditions

_None_

### Attack Path

1. User A initiates a cross-chain operation (e.g., `borrowCrossChain`) when contract has 1 ETH
2. The transaction attempts to use the entire 1 ETH balance via `_lzSend`
3. Before User A's transaction is mined, User B initiates another cross-chain operation
4. User B's transaction also attempts to use the entire 1 ETH balance
5. If User A's transaction is processed first, it will use all 1 ETH
6. User B's transaction will fail due to insufficient balance, or revert with `NotEnoughNative`

### Impact

Users suffer from denied service and failed transactions. The protocol suffers from inefficient use of funds, as each transaction potentially sends more ETH than necessary for fees, which can lead to locked funds at the endpoint contract or funds being returned to the CrossChainRouter that could have been used for other operations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the current implementation with a proper fee calculation:

```diff
function _send(
    uint32 _dstEid,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _borrowIndex,
    uint256 _collateral,
    address _sender,
    address _destlToken,
    address _liquidator,
    address _srcToken,
    ContractType ctype
) internal {
    bytes memory payload =
        abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

    bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);
    
+   // Calculate the required fee for this specific message
+   (uint nativeFee, ) = endpoint.estimateFees(_dstEid, address(this), payload, false, options);
    
+   // Ensure the contract has enough balance
+   require(address(this).balance >= nativeFee, "Insufficient fee");
    
+   // Only use the exact amount needed
-   _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
+   _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(nativeFee, 0), payable(address(this)));
}
```
