# Incorrect borrow accounting due to missing interest accrual on cross-chain borrows

### Summary

When a user takes an additional cross-chain borrow, the protocol is expected to update the user's borrow record by first accruing interest on the existing principal and then adding the new borrowed amount on the source chain. However, in the `_handleValidBorrowRequest` function, **interest is not accrued before updating the borrow record**. The borrow principal is directly incremented with the new borrow amount while also updating the borrow index, which results in the previously accrued interest being permanently skipped.

This oversight causes the protocol to **underestimate the user's true debt on destination chain**, which can lead to incorrect liquidity checks on source chain, missed liquidations, and users borrowing more than they are safely allowed to from source chain.

```solidity
    function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        // Find the specific borrow record using the new helper
        (bool found, uint256 index) =
            lendStorage.findCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, srcEid, currentEid, payload.destlToken);

        if (found) {
            // Update existing borrow
            LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
            userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount; // @audit-issue interest not being accrued here
            userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;

            // Update in storage
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, index, userBorrows[index]);
        } else {
          ...
    }
```

### Root Cause

When updating an existing borrow, the current borrow principal is added to the new borrow amount without accounting for the interest accrued since the last borrow. The borrow index is then updated, effectively **skipping interest accrual on the previously borrowed amount**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user already has an active cross-chain borrow recorded in `crossChainBorrows`.
- The user initiates an additional cross-chain borrow on top existing one.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice has a cross-chain borrow of 1,000 USDC at borrowIndex = 1.00, storing:
   - `principle = 1000`
   - `borrowIndex = 1.00`
2. Time passes and the market accrues interest, increasing borrowIndex to 1.50.
3. Alice borrows an additional 1,000 USDC.
4. The protocol executes:
   `userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;`
   `userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;`
5. The system now stores:
   - `principle = 2000`
   - `borrowIndex = 1.50`
   But the actual borrow should be:
   - `1500 (old principal with interest) + 1000 (new borrow) = 2500`
6. The userâ€™s debt appears 500 USDC lower than reality.
7. Due to this during liquidations the system thinks the user's position is healthier than it actually is, blocking liquidation or allowing more borrows.
8. This leads to under-collateralized risk and potential protocol losses.

### Impact

- Borrowers can accumulate hidden debt.
- Liquidation checks become unreliable and may block necessary liquidations.
- Borrowers can take out more loans than they should be allowed, effectively borrowers can steal funds from the protocol.


### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Before updating borrow principal and index, calculate accrued interest first:

```solidity
uint256 newPrincipal = 
    (userBorrows[index].principle * currentBorrowIndex) / userBorrows[index].borrowIndex;
userBorrows[index].principle = newPrincipal + payload.amount;
userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
```

This ensures the borrow record reflects interest accrual before updating.
