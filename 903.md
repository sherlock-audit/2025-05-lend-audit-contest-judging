# `_handleLiquidationSuccess()` will always revert

### Summary

In `_handleLiquidationSuccess()`, we are calling `lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral()` with zero as the fourth parameter in order to iterate and find the dest chain somehow, but that will never be able to do that as `userCollaterals` no chain is saved in the mapping as zero, thus reverting due to `found` being always of a `false` boolean value.



### Root Cause

 `_handleLiquidationSuccess()` will always revert due to the fourth param being zero instead of an actual value that will find the user collateral via the dest chain.

This shows that in `findCrossChainCollateral()` that `destEid` will always be zero, thus reverting every single time when `found` is in the require statement just below it in `_handleLiquidationSuccess()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. We receive a cross chain message via `_lzReceive()` in order to cross chain liquidate a user from Alice
2. The cross chain liquidation will never be able to execute as it will revert due to the specifics explained in summary

### Impact

Cross chain liquidation is impossible, broken functionality and possibility worsening health of the protocol - medium severity
