# Cross-chain borrowing race condition bypasses invariant protection

### Summary

The asynchronous nature of cross-chain messaging creates a race condition that allows users to bypass the dual-mapping invariant protection. When users initiate nearly simultaneous cross-chain borrows in opposite directions, the timing of message execution can result in both transactions succeeding despite ultimately violating the invariant, permanently locking user funds.

### Root Cause

Cross-chain borrowing follows a multi-step asynchronous process:
1. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` on source chain
2. Message sent to destination chain via LayerZero
3. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` executes on destination (adds `crossChainCollateral` entry)
4. Confirmation message sent back to the source chain
5. `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` executes on source (adds `crossChainBorrow` entry)

The invariant check in [`borrowWithInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L485) occurs during step 3 in `distributeBorrowerLend()`. However, when two opposite-direction borrows are initiated simultaneously, the execution order becomes unpredictable due to network latency, allowing both to pass invariant checks before either completes fully.

### Attack Path

**Normal Sequential Processing (second borrow will revert):**
1. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` on Chain A → Chain B
2. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` called on Chain B (`crossChainCollateral` entry added)
3. `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` called on Chain A (`crossChainBorrow` entry added)
4. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` on Chain B → Chain A
5. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` called on Chain A (`crossChainCollateral` entry added but would revert due to invariant violation during `distributeBorrowerLend()`)

**Race Condition Scenario (both borrows succeed):**
1. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` on Chain A → Chain B
2. User calls `borrowCrossChain()` on Chain B → Chain A (nearly simultaneous)
3. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` called on Chain B (`crossChainCollateral` entry added)
4. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` called on Chain A (`crossChainCollateral` entry added)
5. `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` called on Chain A (`crossChainBorrow` entry added)
6. `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` called on Chain B (`crossChainBorrow` entry added)

**Result:** Both chains have both mappings populated, but neither transaction reverted because invariant checks passed during steps 3-4 when only one mapping was populated per chain.

### Impact

**High** - Permanent fund lockup on both chains with no recovery mechanism:

1. All future operations calling `borrowWithInterest()` permanently revert on both chains
2. Users cannot repay debt, claim rewards, or perform any account operations
3. Undercollateralized positions cannot be liquidated, creating systemic bad debt risk
4. Affects core protocol functions, including:
   - LEND reward distribution
   - New borrowing operations  
   - Debt repayment
   - Liquidation mechanisms
   - Account liquidity calculations

Unlike single-chain invariant violations, this race condition affects multiple chains simultaneously, amplifying the damage.
