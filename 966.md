# Missing Interest Accrual Before Exchange Rate Calculation in Supply Function

### Summary

The [`supply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61) function in CoreRouter retrieves the exchange rate using exchangeRateStored() before calling `mint(),` but does not call `accrueInterest()` first. Since the mint() function internally calls accrueInterest() which updates the exchange rate, there's a mismatch between the exchange rate used for calculating minted tokens and the actual exchange rate at the time of minting.


### Root Cause

In the `supply()` function, the exchange rate is retrieved before the mint operation without ensuring interest has been accrued, The issue is that `exchangeRateStored()` returns the last stored exchange rate without updating it, while `mint()` calls `accrueInterest()` internally, which updates the exchange rate based on accrued interest.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Significant time has passed since the last accrueInterest() call on the lToken


### External Pre-conditions

Volatile market conditions where interest rates change rapidly



### Attack Path

1. Monitor for Stale Exchange Rates
2. Execute Supply with Stale Rate
  - `CoreRouter.supply(1000000e6, USDC_ADDRESS);  // $1M USDC supply`
3. Benefit from Rate Discrepancy
```javascript
// In supply() function:
exchangeRateBefore = 1.05e18;  // Stale rate used for calculation

// mint() internally calls accrueInterest():
// - Exchange rate updates to 1.08e18
// - Compound mints: 1,000,000 / 1.08 = 925,926 lUSDC tokens

// But protocol calculates:
mintTokens = (1000000e6 * 1e18) / 1.05e18 = 952,381 lUSDC  // Wrong!

// Protocol records: 952,381 lUSDC (26,455 more than actually minted)
```

4. Exploit the Discrepancy
```javascript
// Protocol's internal accounting vs reality:
totalInvestment[attacker][lUSDC] = 952,381  // Protocol thinks
ERC20(lUSDC).balanceOf(coreRouter) = 925,926  // Actual lTokens held

// Attacker can now borrow against inflated balance
uint256 maxBorrow = calculateMaxBorrow(952,381);  // Based on wrong balance
CoreRouter.borrow(maxBorrow, ETH_ADDRESS);  // Over-borrow against phantom collateral
```


### Impact

Protocol records more lTokens than actually minted, Users can borrow against tokens that don't exist, which can lead to protocol insolvency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Call `accrueInterest`() before retrieving the exchange rate to ensure consistency
