# User will over-leverage across chains as protocol accepts already-utilized collateral

### Summary

Cross-chain borrowing incorrectly uses **total collateral** from Chain A to authorize a borrow on Chain B. This causes **collateral already used for borrows on other chains** (e.g., Chain C or local Chain A) to be **double-counted**. As a result, a user can **over-leverage** and **borrow more than allowed**, leading to potential insolvency.

### Root Cause

- In `CrossChainRouter.sol: 147 borrowCrossChain()` function, the `collateral` passed to Chain B is calculated using `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` which **includes all of Chain A’s collaterals** - even those backing same-chain or other cross-chain borrows.

```solidity
function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
    ...
    (, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

    // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
    // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
    _send(
        _destEid,
        _amount,
        0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
147     collateral,
        msg.sender,
        destLToken,
        address(0), // liquidator
        _borrowToken,
        ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
    );
}
```

- Then on Chain B(`CrossChainRouter.sol: 622 handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`), this `collateral` is compared against `totalBorrowed` - which **includes borrows from all chains against Chain B's collateral**, not just those using Chain A’s collateral.

```solidity
function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    ...
    // Get existing borrow amount
    (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );

    // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
622    require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

    // Execute the borrow on destination chain
    CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, destUnderlying);
```

- This breaks the principle that each cross-chain borrow should be backed by **isolated collateral** from its own `srcEid`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User supplies collateral on Chain A
2. User borrows on Chain C (using Chain A’s collateral)
3. User initiates a new cross-chain borrow on Chain B

### External Pre-conditions

- Chain A’s liquidity check must not reject multiple cross-chain borrows using the same collateral.

### Attack Path

1. User supplies $100 collateral on Chain A
2. Borrows $60 on Chain C
3. Again borrows $60 on Chain B
4. Both borrows are independently approved using the same $100 collateral, leading to $120 total exposure
5. The protocol is undercollateralized and may face bad debt if liquidation fails

### Impact

-  **Protocol risk of under-collateralized positions**
-  Users may borrow **more than allowed**, bypassing loan-to-value safety
-  Total exposure exceeds declared collateral, leading to **losses on liquidation**

### Mitigation

On Chain A:
- Pass **only available collateral**: `availableCollateral = collateral - totalBorrowed` when sending the LayerZero message.
```solidity
function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
    ...
-    (, uint256 collateral) =
+    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

    // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
    // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
    _send(
        _destEid,
        _amount,
        0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
-       collateral,
+       collateral - borrowed
        msg.sender,
        destLToken,
        address(0), // liquidator
        _borrowToken,
        ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
    );
}
```

On Chain B:
- Compare against **only the total borrow amount backed by Chain A’s collateral**, which can be calculated by summing all `crossChainCollaterals` entries where `srcEid == Chain A`, across all `userBorrowedAssets`' lTokens, plus the new requested `payload.amount`.
