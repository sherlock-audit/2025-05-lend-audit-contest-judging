# LToken Transfers Bypass TotalInvestment Tracking

### Summary

A critical accounting inconsistency in the Lend-V2 protocol will cause incorrect investment tracking for users as LToken transfers are not reflected in the LendStorage.totalInvestment mapping, leading to potential fund loss, incorrect reward distribution, and manipulation of protocol mechanisms.

### Root Cause

The protocol uses `lendStorage.totalInvestment` to track user investments and make critical decisions about redemptions, liquidations, and rewards. However, LTokens are ERC20 tokens that can be freely transferred between addresses, and these transfers do not update the `totalInvestment` mapping.
In `CoreRouter.sol`, the redeem function checks:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L107
This check assumes that `totalInvestment` accurately reflects a user's LToken balance. However, if a user transfers their LTokens to another address, the `totalInvestment` value remains unchanged, creating a disconnect between actual token ownership and recorded investment amounts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User A has supplied assets and received LTokens, with their `totalInvestment` correctly recorded
2. User A transfers some or all of their LTokens to User B using the standard ERC20 transfer function
3. No mechanism exists to update `totalInvestment` values for either user during this transfer

### External Pre-conditions

None required.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Unauthorized Redemption
1. User A supplies 100 tokens and receives 100 LTokens
2. User A's `totalInvestment` is set to 100
3. User A transfers all 100 LTokens to User B
4. User A's `totalInvestment` remains at 100, despite having 0 LTokens
5. User A can still call `redeem(100, lTokenAddress)`, which will check `totalInvestment` (still 100) and allow the redemption
6. The protocol attempts to redeem tokens that User A no longer owns, potentially causing transaction failures or incorrect asset transfers

Scenario 2: Reward Manipulation
1. User A supplies a large amount of assets and receives LTokens
2. User A transfers these LTokens to multiple addresses they control
3. Each address maintains the original `totalInvestment` value
4. When rewards are distributed based on `totalInvestment`, the same investment is counted multiple times
5. User A receives disproportionate rewards compared to their actual investment



### Impact

This vulnerability has severe implications:
1. Accounting Inconsistencies: The protocol's internal accounting becomes detached from actual token ownership
2. Unauthorized Redemptions: Users can redeem assets they no longer own
3. Reward Manipulation: Users can artificially inflate their reward allocations
4. Liquidation Failures: Incorrect collateral calculations may prevent proper liquidations
5. Protocol Insolvency: In extreme cases, this could lead to protocol insolvency if multiple users exploit this vulnerability
The severity is high because it undermines the fundamental accounting system of the protocol and can lead to direct financial losses.
