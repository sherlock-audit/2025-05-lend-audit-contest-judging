# LEND rewards can be drained due to accounting mistake.

### Summary

The Lend protcol is a Compound fork and it gives out LEND as rewards just like with COMP. The difference is, the CoreRouter.sol receives all the LEND rewards from the Lendtroller and distribute them to borrower and suppliers based on their activity. The reward of each individual user is stored in a mapping in LendStorage.sol. After the user claim his rightful amount of rewards, this mapping is not rest nor the claim amount deducted. ITs not done anywhere else either, allowing the user to claim multiple time and drain all the rewards. 

### Root Cause

The reward amount of a user is stored in [LendStorage.sol::lendAccrued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L76), which is updated with [distributeSupplierLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L303) and [distributeBorrowerLend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L342) based on their activity. There is no other function that updates the mapping beside these two. When users claim their reward in [CoreRouter.sol::claimLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L370), the CoreRouter first claim all the rewards of all the users from the Lendtroller via [Lendtroller.sol::claimLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/Lendtroller.sol#L1437), then the stored `lendAccrued` amount is transfered via [grandLendInternal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L416). Since the stored amount is not reset nor deducted and the claimed amount is not stored, this allows for unlimited claim of LEND rewards as long as the CoreRouter.sol has enough.

```solidity 
    function claimLend(address[] memory holders, LToken[] memory lTokens, bool borrowers, bool suppliers) external {
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).claimLend(address(this));
        ...
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
@>          uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
            if (accrued > 0) {
                grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
            }
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
    }

    function grantLendInternal(address user, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        address lendAddress = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).getLendAddress();
        uint256 lendBalance = IERC20(lendAddress).balanceOf(address(this));

        if (amount > 0 && amount <= lendBalance) {
@>          IERC20(lendAddress).safeTransfer(user, amount);
            return 0;
        }
        return amount;
    }

```


### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users must accrue LEND rewards.

### Attack Path

1. 10 Users are eligible for 100 LEND each. Total LEND rewards is 1000.
2. A user claim lend 10 times. Theres nothing stopping him from doing this. He can call claimLend() 10 times or put his address 10 times in holders[].
3. The other 9 users lose their eligible reward.

### Impact

The LEND rewards of users can be drained. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a function to update the `lendAccrued` mapping after a user claim or keep track of his claimed amount and deduct it from `lendAccrued` during claiming. The point is to stop a user from draining all the LEND rewards.
