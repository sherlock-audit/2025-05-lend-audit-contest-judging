# Incorrect payload data is sent to dest chain after liquidation executed on src chain

### Summary

Incorrect arguments used for the function `CrossChainRouter::_send()` causes payload sent to dest chain to be invalid

### Root Cause

The function [`CrossChainRouter::_handleLiquidationExecute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L312-L366) handles the liquidation execution on src chain (collateral chain) of a cross chain borrow liquidation. The function has logics to seize borrower's collateral and update total investment for both borrower and liquidator. At the end of the function, it sends a `LiquidationSuccess` message back to the dest chain. The payload is below with the comments
```solidity
        _send(
            srcEid,
            payload.amount, // <<<<<<< `payload.amount` is actually the amount of collateral token to be seized
            0,
            0,
            payload.sender,
            payload.destlToken, // <<<<<<<< `payload.destlToken` is actually LToken on collateral chain
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.srcToken,
            ContractType.LiquidationSuccess
        );
```

On the dest chain, the [function `_handleLiquidationSuccess()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443-L471) is used to handle the `LiquidationSuccess` sent from the function `_handleLiquidationExecute()` on src chain. The problem arises when on dest chain, `payload.destlToken` is used to retrieve the underlying token address and `payload.amount` is used to repay. This is totally incorrect because `payload.destlToken` is LToken on src chain, which does not exist on this dest chain and `payload.amount` is the seized collateral token amount, not the borrowed asset amount to be repaid.
```solidity
    function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
@>        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken); // like unable to retrieve the asset

        // Find the specific collateral record
        (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
            payload.sender,
            underlying,
            currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
            0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        );

        require(found, "Borrow position not found");

        LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCollaterals = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(payload.sender, underlying);
        uint32 srcEid = uint32(userCollaterals[index].srcEid);

        // Now that we know the borrow position and srcEid, we can repay the borrow using the escrowed tokens
        // repayCrossChainBorrowInternal will handle updating state and distributing rewards.
        repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
            payload.sender, // The borrower
            payload.liquidator, // The liquidator (repayer)
@>            payload.amount, // Amount to repay
@>            payload.destlToken, // lToken representing the borrowed asset on this chain
            srcEid // The chain where the collateral (and borrow reference) is tracked
        );
    }
```

##
The same pattern also exists at the function [`_sendLiquidationFailure()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L491-L503)
```solidity
    function _sendLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        _send(
            srcEid,
@>            payload.amount,
            0,
            0,
            payload.sender,
@>            payload.destlToken,
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.srcToken,
            ContractType.LiquidationFailure
        );
    }

    function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
@>        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Refund the liquidator
@>        IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

        emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. A cross chain borrow executed
2. After some time, the position is underwater
3. A liquidator tries to liquidate by calling `liquidateCrossChain()`
The whole process of cross chain liquidation will be:
`liquidateCrossChain()` on dest chain -> succeeds
`_handleLiquidationExecute()` on src chain -> succeeds
`_handleLiquidationSuccess()` on dest chain -> fails

### Impact

- Unable to liquidate cross chain borrows
- Break core functionality
- Wasting LZ message fees

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider
- Update payload data for the message `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` first
- Then update the logics in the function `_handleLiquidationExecute()` according to the payload update above
- Update payload data for the message `ContractType.LiquidationSuccess`
