# Incorrect Reward Distribution Order for First‐Time Suppliers

### Title
Incorrect Reward Distribution Order for First‐Time Suppliers

### Severity
High

### Impact
High
•	Every new supplier calling CoreRouter.supply(...) triggers this code path, so all first‐time suppliers are affected.
•	It requires no special conditions beyond being the first supply on a given market.

### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol, Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol

## Description
In CoreRouter.supply(...), the code currently does:
```solidity
// Mint lTokens and compute how many were created
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

// Distribute any LEND rewards for this supplier
lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);

// THEN update their totalInvestment for the newly minted lTokens
lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
    msg.sender, 
    _lToken, 
    lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
);
```
But distributeSupplierLend calculates LEND owed as:
```solidity
uint256 supplierTokens = totalInvestment[supplier][lToken];
uint256 supplierDelta = supplierTokens × (supplyIndex – supplierIndex);
lendAccrued[supplier] += supplierDelta;
```
When totalInvestment[supplier][lToken] is zero (the first time a user supplies), supplierTokens is zero, so supplierDelta is zero—effectively awarding no LEND for that initial supply. Only after updateTotalInvestment sets the new balance do rewards begin accumulating on subsequent index increases.

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	Alice is the first user to supply DAI into Market X. She expects to earn LEND from the moment she supplies.
	2.	She calls CoreRouter.supply(100 DAI, DAI).
	3.	Inside supply(), the code mints 100 lDAI, then calls distributeSupplierLend(lDAI, Alice) while totalInvestment[Alice][lDAI] == 0. Therefore, Alice’s accrued LEND remains 0.
	4.	Next, updateTotalInvestment sets totalInvestment[Alice][lDAI] = 100. From now on she will earn LEND on her 100 lDAI—but she has already missed out on whatever rewards had been accruing prior to her supply.

If rewards had been accumulating before Alice’s supply (e.g. because other markets were active), she permanently loses LEND for that initial period. Even if she supplies at block N and the supply‐index is already higher than LEND_INITIAL_INDEX, supplierTokens is zero at distribution time, so none of that index gap is credited to her.

## Recommendations
Swap the two calls so that totalInvestment is updated first, then distributeSupplierLend runs against the correct (nonzero) balance. For example:
```solidity
         // Mint lTokens and compute how many were created
         require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
         uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

         lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);

-        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender); // distributes on zero balance
-
-        // Update total investment using calculated mintTokens
-        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
-            msg.sender, 
-            _lToken, 
-            lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
-        );
+        // First update the user’s balance, so supplyIndex applies to mintTokens
+        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
+            msg.sender,
+            _lToken,
+            lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
+        );
+
+        // Now distribute LEND rewards based on the new nonzero investment
+        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
```
This change ensures that on a first supply, totalInvestment is set to mintTokens before distributeSupplierLend computes supplierTokens × deltaIndex. As a result, new suppliers immediately receive any LEND that has accrued up to that block.
