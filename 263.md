# _handleLiquidationSuccess() will always reverts leading to data desync accros chains

### Summary

CrossChainRouter.sol _handleLiquidationSuccess()'s callback lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral() expected to find relevant collateral within destination endpoint, meanwhile it heavily relies on it itself 
```solidity
    function findCrossChainCollateral(
        address user,
        address underlying,
        uint256 srcEid,
        uint256 destEid,
        address borrowedlToken,
        address srcToken
    ) public view returns (bool, uint256) {
        Borrow[] memory userCollaterals = crossChainCollaterals[user][underlying];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userCollaterals.length;) {
            if (
                userCollaterals[i].srcEid == srcEid && userCollaterals[i].destEid == destEid
                    && userCollaterals[i].borrowedlToken == borrowedlToken && userCollaterals[i].srcToken == srcToken
            ) {
                return (true, i);
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return (false, 0);
    }
```
The field we trying to find here is index, based in destEId. But as we see. destEid were provided as 0 inside _handleLiquidationSuccess() 
```solidity
        // Find the specific collateral record
        (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
            payload.sender,
            underlying,
            currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
            0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        );
```



### Root Cause

Wrong architecture of findCrossChainCollateral() as you trying to find field, which must be know for that callback

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

will happens for every cross chain liquidation

### Impact

data desync, loan not repaid

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

_No response_
