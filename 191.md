# Lack of locking mechanism when dealing crossChainBorrowing

### Summary

Due to the lack of locking mechanism and the non-atomic nature of cross-chain operations, attackers could send borrow requests to different chains and also borrow assets on the source chain at the same time and get values beyond his collateral.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L155

When calling `borrowCrossChain()` function, the value of collateral on the source chain will be sent to the destination chain. 
On the destination chain, if the collateral number passes the check, the token will sent directly to user. After sending the borrow request, on the source chain, the collateral is not locked which gives the chance to request  `borrowCrossChain()` again for different chains. 



Moreover, before receiving the message from the destination chain, attackers could also borrow tokens on the source chain base on the same collateral. By this method, users get more value than his collateral and run away.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Attackers supplied token

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Attacker supply 100 USDC on chain A
2. Attacker call `borrowCrossChain()` for 60 USDC to chain B and C in the same block
3. Attacker call `borrow()` for 60 USDC on chain A in the same block above
4. Attacker brings these 180 USDC away

### Impact

The attacker gains token and the protocol lose token.
