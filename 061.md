# Cross-Chain Borrowing Exploit

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the multi-chain lending protocol that leverages LayerZero for cross-chain messaging. The system allows users to supply collateral on one chain and borrow on others. However, due to the absence of a unified cross-chain collateral verification mechanism, an attacker can reuse the same collateral across multiple chains to borrow far beyond their allowed limit.

This results in a severe over-leveraging exploit: by supplying collateral on a single chain (e.g., Base), the attacker can perform independent borrow actions across all other chains (Ethereum, Sonic, Monad, BNB), each of which recognizes the same collateral in isolation. The protocol fails to account for previous cross-chain borrowings during new loan calculations, enabling systemic insolvency and potential multi-chain fund drains.



### Root Cause

The protocol relies on per-chain state and does not maintain a globally synchronized collateral-to-debt mapping. Each chain independently calculates collateral sufficiency without awareness of borrowings that have occurred elsewhere. This gap is exploited via LayerZero messages that initiate isolated borrow transactions on different chains. When a borrowing operations happen only the target chain is acknowledged about it by messaging.

#### **Collateral Calculation Isolated Per Chain**

The protocol initiates a [borrowing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) request using locally available collateral data, without querying other chains for existing debts:

```solidity
// Source: Cross-chain borrow initiation
(, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

...
// getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length;) {
            LToken asset = LToken(suppliedAssets[i]);
            uint256 lTokenBalanceInternal = totalInvestment[account][address(asset)];

            // Get collateral factor and price for this asset
            vars.collateralFactor =
                Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).getCollateralFactorMantissa(address(asset))});
            vars.exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: asset.exchangeRateStored()});

            vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset);
            vars.oraclePrice = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissa});
            vars.tokensToDenom = mul_(mul_(vars.collateralFactor, vars.exchangeRate), vars.oraclePrice);

            // Add to collateral sum
            vars.sumCollateral =
                mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.tokensToDenom, lTokenBalanceInternal, vars.sumCollateral);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

This `collateral` value is embedded in the outbound LayerZero message and trusted by the destination chain, which has no way to validate whether this amount has already been used for borrowing elsewhere.

#### **Lack of Global State Synchronization**

Upon receiving a borrow request, the destination chain validates the request against only its *local* view of the account’s debts:

```solidity
(uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
    payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
);
require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

Here, `totalBorrowed` is derived solely from the local `lendStorage`, ignoring any borrowings the attacker already performed on other chains. This allows the attacker to meet the collateral requirement repeatedly on each chain.

#### **Borrow State Is Fragmented**

Each chain stores borrowings independently and updates them without verification of other chains’ borrow states:

```solidity
function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    ...
    if (found) {
        userBorrows[index].principle += payload.amount;
        ...
        lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(...);
    } else {
        lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(...);
    }
    ...
}
```

This local record-keeping design is inherently unsafe in a multi-chain lending context, as it permits parallel borrow operations with stale or incomplete collateral data.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

* Attacker supplies \$10,000 worth of collateral on **Base**.
* Each chain allows up to 85% LTV.
* The attacker performs separate crosschain borrow transactions on:

  * **Ethereum**: Borrows \$8,500
  * **Sonic**: Borrows \$8,500
  * **Monad**: Borrows \$8,500
  * **BNB**: Borrows \$8,500

**Total Collateral Used**: \$10,000
**Total Borrowed Across Chains**: \$34,000

The attacker walks away with \$34,000 using \$10,000 collateral, realizing a 240% over-borrow.

### Impact

* **Affected Chains**: All chains where the lending protocol is deployed (Base, Ethereum, Sonic, Monad, BNB).
* **Exploit Outcome**: Full protocol drain using the attack path described above


Without a shared collateral accounting system or synchronized borrow tracking across chains, the protocol is vulnerable to catastrophic fund loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When user supplies from one chain, all the other chains should be acknowledged about this collateral and same for the borrows.
