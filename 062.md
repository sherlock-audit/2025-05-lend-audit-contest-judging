# Missing withdraw function will lock ETH in CoreRouter.sol Contract

### Summary

The missing withdraw function will lock ETH sent to [`CoreRouter.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol) Contract

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:46`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L46), it appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which results in the Ether being locked in the contract. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract needs to hold ETH for LayerZero cross-chain operations
2. The contract has no function to withdraw ETH, even for the owner
3. The contract inherits from Ownable but doesn't implement any ETH withdrawal functionality

### External Pre-conditions

1. The contract must receive ETH through the receive() function
2. This can happen through:
      - Direct ETH transfers to the contract
      - LayerZero operations that require ETH for fees
      - Any other contract interactions that send ETH to this contract

### Attack Path

1. Anyone can sends ETH e.g 2 ETH
2. There is no way of Recovering it.

### Impact

If too much ETH is sent to the contract, there is no way of recovering it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add this function to [`CoreRouter.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol) contract:
```sol
function withdrawEth() external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No ETH to withdraw");
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
    require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
}
```
