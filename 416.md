# Redeem Function Uses Stale Exchange Rate, Underpaying Users

### Summary

The `redeem` function fails to call `accrueInterest()` on the underlying lending token `(lToken)` before reading the exchange rate used to calculate the amount of underlying tokens to return to the user. This results in the use of a stale exchange rate that does not reflect the most recent interest accrued.

As a result, users may receive fewer underlying tokens than they are actually entitled to, because the exchange rate used in the calculation is lower than the up-to-date rate. This leads to inaccurate accounting, underpayment to users, and potential trust issues for the protocol.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    // Get exchange rate before redeem
@> uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

    // Calculate expected underlying tokens
@> uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

    // Perform redeem
@> require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed"); // accrued interest called here 

    // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
@> IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```


The protocol calculates how many underlying tokens to return based on a stale exchange rate. While the `redeem()` function inside the `lToken` does call `accrueInterest()` internally, the value of `expectedUnderlying` is already calculated by then â€” using the outdated exchange rate.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `redeem(100 lTokens)` expecting equivalent underlying tokens.

2. Protocol reads exchange rate before interest is accrued.

3. Exchange rate is e.g., 1.00, while the true current rate is 1.10.

4. expectedUnderlying = 100 * 1.00 = 100 tokens.

5. Internally, the call to redeem() triggers `accrueInterest()`, and the `lToken` transfers 110 tokens.

6. Protocol sends only 100 tokens to the user, keeping 10 tokens unintentionally.

This discrepancy is due to the early read of a stale exchange rate and results in users receiving less than theyâ€™re entitled to.

### Impact

Letâ€™s assume:

Real current `exchangeRateStored()` after interest accrual is: 1.10

Stale exchange rate used in calculation: 1.00

User redeems 100 `lTokens`

Expected return with fresh rate:
```solidity
expectedUnderlying = 100 * 1.10 = 110 tokens
```

With stale rate:
```solidity
expectedUnderlying = 100 * 1.00 = 100 tokens
```
ðŸ”» The protocol underpays the user by 10 tokens, while the `lToken` contract has already redeemed the correct amount (110), causing an accounting mismatch and value leakage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should explicitly call:

```solidity
LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
```
before:

reading `exchangeRateStored()`

performing any calculations involving the exchange rate

executing balance updates or redemptions

This ensures that all exchange rateâ€“based calculations reflect the most recent interest accrual and match the actual behavior of the underlying` lToken` contract.
