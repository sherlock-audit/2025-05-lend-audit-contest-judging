# unfair liquidation due to incorrect calculation of borrowed funds

### Summary

when liquidators want to liquidate a user they call coreRouter::liquidateBorrow function which internally calls liquidateBorrowInternal function which calls liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function which checks that borrower is eligible to liquidate or not.
liquidateBorrow function calls lendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function which returns collateral(with considering collateral factor) and borrowed(with considering interest ). 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L238-L239

```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);
```

it gives these  (collateral,borrowed) as inputs to liquidateBorrowInternal function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L241-L244

```solidity
        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }
```

which give them as input to liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L266-L268

```solidity
    liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(borrowedlToken, borrower, repayAmount, collateral, borrowed) == 0,
      "Borrow not allowed" );
```

in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal function when  isDeprecated=false, it uses below lines of code to check wheather borrower is eligible to liquidate or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L342-L350

```solidit
    } else {
      // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
       uint256 borrowedAmount;
     // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
      borrowedAmount =
       (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
    require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

here they are using borrowedAmount instead of borrowed in below check 

```solidity
  require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

here, 

```solidity
 LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex() > borrowBalance.borrowIndex  => borrowedAmount > borrowed.
```

so we are using amount ( borrowedAmount) greater than what should be used (borrowed) in above check.
which we allow malicious liquidators to liquidate borrowers who has sufficient collateral backing there borrows and are not eligible to liquidate.

### Root Cause

using borrowedAmount in place of borrowed, in below lines of code.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L350

```solidity
            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

let's say a borrower has collateral (with considering collateral factor) =100, borrowed = 80 ( with considering interests).
and

```solidity
  uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex = 1.5 
```
for token he borrowed.
liquidator should be unable to liquidate this borrower because 100 > 80.( he has more collateral to back his borrows).
but due to this wrong  check used,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L347-L350

```solidity
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;


            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```


borrowedAmount = 80*1.5=120,
borrowedAmount > collateral (120 >100) // true, malicious liquidator is able to liquidate a borrower who is not eligible to // liquidate.

### Impact

borrowers positions  can be liquidated even if they have enough collateral and  not eligible to liquidate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

remove below lines of code,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L344-L349

```solidity
            uint256 borrowedAmount;


            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```

and modify this,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L350

```solidity
            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```

to this 

```solidity
            require(borrowed> collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```
