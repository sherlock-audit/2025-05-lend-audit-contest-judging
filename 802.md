# Reentrancy Vulnerability in redeem and borrow Functions of CoreRouter

### Summary

The lack of reentrancy protection in the redeem and borrow functions of CoreRouter.sol will cause a significant loss of funds for the protocol as an attacker will repeatedly call these functions to drain assets.

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol, the redeem function and borrow function make external calls to the lToken contract and underlying token contract before updating state variables in lendStorage. In redeem, the redeem call to lToken and transfer call to the underlying token occur before updating totalInvestment.In borrow, the borrow call to lToken and transfer call to the underlying token happen before updating the borrow balance. This violates the checks effects interactions pattern, enabling reentrancy.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call setFee() to set fee to be exactly 1 ETH.
lendingRate to be other than 1.0.
Number of ETH in stake.sol to go from 10 ETH to 100 ETH within 24 hours.

### External Pre-conditions

ETH oracle needs to go from 4000 to 5000 within 2 minutes.
Gas price needs to be exactly 100 wei.

### Attack Path

For redeem:

Attacker supplies tokens to the protocol and receives lTokens.
Attacker calls redeem, triggering an external call to the lToken contract.
During the external call, attacker reenters redeem before state updates, repeating the process to drain funds.

For borrow:

Attacker supplies collateral and calls borrow.
During the external call to lToken, attacker reenters borrow.
Attacker borrows more than allowed before state updates, accumulating excessive debt.

### Impact

In redeem, attackers can redeem more tokens than entitled, draining protocol funds.
In borrow, attackers can borrow beyond allowed limits, leading to undercollateralized loans. The attacker gains the excess tokens or borrowed assets, severely impacting the protocol’s financial integrity.

    }
}

### Mitigation

Apply OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard with the nonReentrant modifier to redeem and borrow
