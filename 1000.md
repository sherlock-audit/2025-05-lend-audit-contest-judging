# Reverts during cross chain messaging are not handled.

### Summary

Reverts may occur at any stage of cross chain messaging. In that case, data structure changes in source chain are not undone.

### Root Cause

LayerZero is a non-atomic, asynchronous messaging protocol. That means:
Once a message is sent and state is changed on the source chain, it’s done.
If the destination chain reverts, the source chain won’t know — unless you explicitly send a message back.

There are many provisions for reverts during cross chain communications in the protocol. What if a message from source chain is reverted on destination chain? The data structure changes on source chain must be undone. The `_lzReceive()` and `lzSend` must have try-catch implementation to notify failure for each type of payloads.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User on chain A borrows on chain B.
2. Liquidator tries to liquidate on chain B.
3. Calls `liquidateCrossChain()`.
4. Chain B sends message of type `CrossChainLiquidationExecute()` to chain A.
5. Chain A sends back `LiquidationSuccess` and seizes borrower assets and updates `totalInvestments` of borrower and liquidator.
6. Now chain B reverts.

### Impact

The protocol enters an irreversible inconsistent state across chains.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use some mechanism to inform the source chain in case of reverts. Also, make all state changes on destination chain   after the final message in the communication.
