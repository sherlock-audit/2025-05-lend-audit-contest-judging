# LEND rewards may get stucked due to unhandled return value in grantLendInternal

### Summary

The `claimLend()` function in `CoreRouter.sol` fails to handle the return value from `grantLendInternal()`, potentially causing permanent loss of LEND token rewards for users when the contract has insufficient LEND balance.


### Root Cause

In [grantLendInternal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L416-#L424), if the contract does not have enough LEND token balance to fulfill the amount, it returns the untransferred amount

However, in [claimLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L370), 

``uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);``
``if (accrued > 0) {``
    ``grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued); //audit: return value ignored``
``}``


The return value is silently ignored, meaning any LEND tokens that couldn't be transferred to the user (due to insufficient balance) are not re-accrued, retried, or recorded elsewhere but will get stucked in the contract

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users may permanently lose accrued rewards if the contract lacks sufficient LEND balance

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `claimLend()` to handle the return value from `grantLendInternal()` and preserve the unclaimed amount for future withdrawals
