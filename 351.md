# Cross-Chain Borrowing State Corruption Due to Improper Mapping Updates

### Summary

The protocol's cross-chain borrowing system becomes unusable when a user borrows across multiple chains due to an invariant violation in the borrowWithInterest function. The issue occurs when both crossChainBorrows and crossChainCollaterals mappings get populated on the same chain, causing the function to revert and effectively locking the user's position.

### Root Cause

1. Incorrect State Management:

When Alice borrows on Chain A from Chain B, Chain A updates crossChainCollateral and Chain B updates crossChainBorrow

When Alice then borrows on Chain C from Chain A, Chain A updates crossChainBorrow while already having crossChainCollateral entries

This violates the protocol's invariant that only one mapping (crossChainBorrows OR crossChainCollaterals) should be populated per token per user

This is possible because when updating the state the protocol doesn't check if the entry already exist on the opposite  state

2. Overly Strict Invariant Check:

The require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0) check fails when both mappings have entries

[This check is meant to prevent accounting errors but doesn't account for legitimate multi-chain borrowing scenarios](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L485)

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice borrows on Chain A using Chain B as collateral source

* Chain A: crossChainCollaterals[alice][token] populated

* Chain B: crossChainBorrows[alice][token] populated

2. Alice then borrows on Chain C using Chain A as collateral source

* Chain A: Now has both:

crossChainCollaterals[alice][token] (from Chain B borrowing)

crossChainBorrows[alice][token] (from Chain C borrowing)

* Chain C: crossChainCollaterals[alice][token] populated

3. Any attempt to query Alice's position on Chain A via borrowWithInterest() reverts

* Both mappings are now populated on Chain A

* The invariant check fails

* Protocol functionality is effectively frozen for Alice on Chain A

### Impact

Increase risk of protocol insolvency because such position can't be liquidated or repay or redeem. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the invariant check or refactor the logic.
