# Repayment logic incorrectly updates same-chain borrow balances for cross-chain borrows.

### Summary

In the `repayBorrowInternal `function of `CoreRouter`, the code updates or removes the borrow balance in storage after every repayment, regardless of whether the borrow is a same-chain or cross-chain borrow. If the borrow is actually a cross-chain borrow, this results in incorrect state updates and can corrupt the protocol’s accounting.



### Root Cause

The function `repayBorrowInternal `determines whether the borrow is same-chain or cross-chain using the `_isSameChain` flag to select the correct interest calculation. However, after repaying the borrow, it always updates or removes the borrow balance in storage:
```solidity
if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
    lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
} else {
    lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
        borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
    );
}
```

This logic is only correct for same-chain borrows(`borrowBalance `mapping). For cross-chain borrows, the borrow balance should be updated through cross-chain messaging and not directly on the source chain(`crossChainBorrows` mapping). Updating it here can lead to double accounting, protocol state corruption.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User has a crosschain borrow.

### External Pre-conditions

The user repays a borrow that was originated as a cross-chain borrow.

### Attack Path

1. User opens a cross-chain borrow.
2. User repays the borrow and `repayBorrowInternal` is called.
3. The function updates or removes the borrow balance on the same chain, even though the borrow is cross-chain.
4. The protocol’s accounting is corrupted, and the user’s debt may be lost or double-counted.

### Impact

Cross-chain borrow balances may be incorrectly updated or removed on the wrong chain. This can lead to double accounting or protocol state corruption. The protocol may lose track of outstanding debt, leading to bad debt or loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only update or remove borrow balances in storage for same-chain borrows.

```solidity
// Update same-chain borrow balances only if this is a same-chain borrow
if (_isSameChain) {
    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
        lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
            borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
        );
    }
}
```
