# `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` can be evaluated with stale pricing

### Summary

[`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L407) is used to calculate whether a user's overall account is in good standing or has a shortfall, it calculates the value of their collateral (discounted by the collateral factor) and borrows to compare.

### Root Cause

However it uses the `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset)` to get the underlying price of the `asset` as shown below

```sol
File: Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol
385:     function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
386:         address account,
387:         LToken lTokenModify,
388:         uint256 redeemTokens,
389:         uint256 borrowAmount
390:     ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {

///SNIP
407:      @>     vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset);
408:             vars.oraclePrice = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissa});

```
The problem is that the price not updated first or confirmed to be up to be valid before it is used hence a stale price could be used for evaluation and this function is used widely within the contract leading to inaccurate results.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

NIL

### Impact

Use of wrong price in the evaluation of collateral and borrowed amount when `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is called.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider validating the fetched price for before use in the evalution of borrows and collateral
