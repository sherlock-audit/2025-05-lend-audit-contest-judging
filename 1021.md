# User will lose sent ETH in `borrowCrossChain()` if insufficient for Fees

### Summary

Missing validation of `msg.value` against LayerZero fees in `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` will cause a loss of sent ETH for **User**. If **User** sends ETH that, even with the contract's balance, is not enough for the LayerZero fee, the transaction reverts after the ETH transfer, trapping **User's** ETH in the contract.

### Root Cause

- In [CrossChainRouter.sol:113](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113), the `borrowCrossChain()` function is `payable` but lacks a pre-check to ensure `msg.value` (plus contract balance) is sufficient for the LayerZero fee before the LayerZero `_send()` operation.
- The overridden `_payNative()` function uses `address(this).balance` to pay fees, and if this (now including `msg.value`) is insufficient, it reverts, but the `msg.value` has already been transferred to `CrossChainRouter`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `CrossChainRouter` contract has an ETH balance that, even when combined with **User's** `msg.value`, is less than the required LayerZero messaging fee for the `borrowCrossChain` operation.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The LayerZero messaging fee for the specific cross-chain transaction is greater than `address(CrossChainRouter).balance + msg.value` provided by **User**.

### Attack Path

1.  **User** calls `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` providing some ETH via `msg.value`.
2.  The `msg.value` is transferred to the `CrossChainRouter` contract.
3.  The function proceeds to call `_send()` for LayerZero messaging.
4.  Inside the LayerZero logic, `_payNative()` is called.
5.  `_payNative()` checks if `address(this).balance` (which now includes the user's `msg.value`) is sufficient for `_nativeFee`.
6.  If `address(this).balance < _nativeFee`, `_payNative()` reverts.
7.  The entire `borrowCrossChain()` transaction reverts.

### Impact

**User** suffers a direct loss of the ETH sent via `msg.value`, as it becomes trapped in the `CrossChainRouter` contract with no mechanism for automatic refund. Recovery would require manual intervention by the contract owner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Estimate the fee and verify `address(this).balance` (including `msg.value`) is sufficient *before* LayerZero calls, reverting early if not.
