# redeem doesnt call accure interest

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100

### Summary

The `redeem` function is used by users to redeem ltokens for underlying token. however the current implementation does not call ` LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();` which is responsible for updating interests. meaning when users call redeem, they redeem based on old interest, this could lead to redeem more than theyre allowed to if this user has debt vice versa.

### Root Cause

Accure isnt called on redeem
```javascript
  function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);
//@audit accure interest not called
        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;


```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. interest is accrued after a while 

### External Pre-conditions

no-cooment

### Attack Path

1. users deposit
2. system accrues interest
3. users borrow
4. system accrues interest
5. user goes to redeem
6. accrue isnt called, users uses old interest

### Impact

Users redeem based on old interest, this allows users to withdraw more if they have debt

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

call ` LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();` on redeem
