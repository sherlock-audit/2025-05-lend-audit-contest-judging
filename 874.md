# The max repayable amount is calculated incorrectly using the principal borrow amount instead of the current debt including accrued interest.

### Summary

The liquidation validation process incorrectly calculates the maximum repayable amount (`maxClose`) using the principal borrow amount instead of the current debt including accrued interest. This results in artificially low liquidation limits, preventing liquidators from repaying the full allowed portion of the debt. This deviates from the expected behavior, reducing the maximum liquidation amount available to liquidators and potentially impacting their profits.

### Root Cause

The core issue is in [CoreRouter.sol#L352-355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L352-L355):
```solidity
// CoreRouter.sol: liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
            uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
                Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
            );
```

1. `borrowBalance.amount` represents the principal debt without accrued interest
2. The close factor should be applied to the current debt (principal + interest)
3. This results in an understated `maxClose` value
4. Liquidators are prevented from repaying the full protocol-allowed amount

The correct calculation should use the current debt including interest (`borrowed`) instead of the principal amount.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower becomes undercollateralized

### External Pre-conditions

1. Liquidator attempts to maximize liquidation within protocol limits

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

This issue results in artificially low liquidation limits, preventing liquidators from repaying the full allowed portion of the debt, which deviates from the expected behavior, reducing the maximum liquidation amount available to liquidators and potentially impacting their profits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the current debt including accrued interest (`borrowed`) to calculate the max repayable amount (`maxClose`).
```solidity
// CoreRouter.sol: liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
            uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
-               Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
+               Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowed
            );
```
