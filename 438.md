# Users will receive double LEND rewards when having cross-chain positions

### Summary

The cross-chain lending system incorrectly calculates LEND rewards for borrowers by double counting cross-chain collateral positions as both collateral and borrowing positions, as the `LendStorage::distributeBorrowerLend()` function adds cross-chain collateral records to the borrower amount calculation even though these represent the same economic position.

### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol:365-368` the `distributeBorrowerLend()` function calculates borrower rewards by adding both `borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken)` and `borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken)`. For cross-chain borrowing, cross-chain collateral records created on the destination chain are incorrectly included in the `borrowWithInterest()` calculation, effectively counting the user's collateral position from Chain A as a borrowing position on Chain B for reward purposes.

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:641-651` the `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` function adds a cross-chain collateral record via `lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral()`. This record is then used in `LendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend()` to calculate borrower rewards.

So a user that has collateral on Chain A and borrows on Chain B will receive LEND rewards for the following positions:
- Supplier Rewards for collateral on Chain A
- Borrower Rewards for the cross-chain borrow on Chain A
- Borrower Rewards for the cross-chain collateral on Chain B (this represent the same economic position as the collateral on Chain A)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have collateral on Chain A and use it to borrow on Chain B via cross-chain borrowing
2. LEND reward distribution needs to be active on both chains  

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **User supplies collateral on Chain A** and receives LEND supplier rewards for their collateral position
2. **User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()`** to borrow tokens on Chain B using Chain A collateral
3. **`CrossChainRouter::_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` executes on Chain B**, adding a cross-chain collateral record via `lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral()`
4. **`CrossChainRouter::_handleValidBorrowRequest()` executes on Chain A**, adding a cross-chain borrow record via `lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow()`
5. User accrues borrower rewards for the collateral recorded on chian B, and the borrow on Chain A and accrues supplier rewards for the collateral on Chain A. Double counting the supply/collateral values.

### Impact

Users with cross-chain positions receive approximately double LEND rewards compared to single-chain users with equivalent positions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `LendStorage::distributeBorrowerLend()` function to avoid double counting cross-chain positions. The function should only include actual borrowing positions in the reward calculation, not collateral records that represent the backing for borrows on other chains.
