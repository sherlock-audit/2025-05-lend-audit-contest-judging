# Users may receive less underlying tokens on redeem due to the protocol ignoring pending accrued rewards

### Summary

The `redeem()` function in CoreRouter fetches the exchange rate before calling the underlying LToken's redeem operation, which internally calls `accrueInterest()` and updates the exchange rate, leading to incorrect underlying token transfer amounts.

### Root Cause

In the [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118) function, the exchange rate is fetched too early, before the actual redemption occurs:

```solidity
// Get exchange rate before redeem
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Calculate expected underlying tokens
uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

// Perform redeem
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

// Transfer underlying tokens to the user
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

However, the `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem()` call internally executes `redeemInternal()`, which calls `accrueInterest()` before processing the redemption. This `accrueInterest()` call updates the exchange rate to reflect newly accrued interest, making the previously fetched `exchangeRateBefore` stale.

**How `accrueInterest()` affects the exchange rate:**

The exchange rate is calculated as:
```solidity
exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalSupply
```

When `accrueInterest()` executes, it:
1. Calculates `interestAccumulated = borrowRate * blockDelta * totalBorrows`
2. Updates `totalBorrows` to `totalBorrowsNew = interestAccumulated + totalBorrows`
3. Updates `totalReserves` to `totalReservesNew = interestAccumulated * reserveFactor + totalReserves`

Since `totalBorrows` increases by the full `interestAccumulated` amount, while `totalReserves` only increases by `interestAccumulated * reserveFactor` (where reserveFactor < 1), the net effect is:

**Net increase in numerator = `interestAccumulated * (1 - reserveFactor)`**

This means the exchange rate **increases** after `accrueInterest()`, as suppliers capture the interest earned minus the protocol's reserve portion. The longer the time since last accrual, the larger this increase.

The LToken's `redeemFresh()` function then calculates the actual redemption amount using the updated exchange rate, but CoreRouter transfers tokens based on the old rate, creating a mismatch where users receive fewer tokens than the LToken actually released.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Time has passed since the last interest accrual for the lToken
2. The market has accrued interest that would change the exchange rate
3. User calls the redeem function

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Wait for a period where significant interest has accrued but hasn't been applied to the lToken yet
2. Call `redeem()` function when the stored exchange rate is stale
3. CoreRouter calculates expected underlying tokens using the old exchange rate
4. LToken's `redeem()` call accrues interest and uses the updated exchange rate internally
5. User receives either more or fewer tokens than the LToken released, creating an accounting mismatch

### Impact

Accounting inconsistencies between CoreRouter and the underlying LToken, where the transferred amount doesn't match the actual redemption amount. This can lead to either users receiving fewer tokens than they should (if the exchange rate increases) or the protocol losing funds by over-transferring tokens (if the exchange rate decreases due to bad debt). Over time, these discrepancies accumulate and can cause protocol insolvency.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Accrue interest explicitly before fetching the exchange rate, or fetch the exchange rate after the redemption.

```solidity
// Accrue interest first to get current exchange rate
LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

// Get current exchange rate after accrual
uint256 exchangeRateCurrent = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Calculate expected underlying tokens
uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / 1e18;

// Perform redeem
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

// Transfer underlying tokens to the user
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

This ensures the exchange rate used for calculations matches the one used internally by the LToken during redemption.
