# supply and redeem functions are using outdated exchangeRate.

### Summary

The `supply()` function in `CoreRouter.sol` uses the `exchangeRateStored()` method to compute how many `lTokens` (e.g., cTokens) to credit a user after minting. However, `exchangeRateStored()` simply returns the last stored exchange rate and does not account for interest accrued since the last update. This makes the rate stale when used in real-time calculations.

Instead, the function should call `exchangeRateCurrent()`, which updates and returns the latest exchange rate, accounting for all accrued interest. Failing to do so allows a user to receive more lTokens than they should, enabling them to drain lTokens from the `CoreRouter` contract by supplying a large amount of funds by using a flash loan.


The `CoreRouter.redeem()` function also has this issue. But, in this case, users receive fewer underlying tokens than their lTokens are actually worth, resulting in a loss for the users.


### Root Cause

Using `exchangeRateStored()` instead of using `exchangeRateCurrent()` for calculating `lToken` amounts. 

```solidity
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
     
        ...
        // Get exchange rate before mint
        // @audit-issue uses outdated rate here
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored(); 

        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

        ...

        // Update total investment using calculated mintTokens
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
        );
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. CoreRouter holds 30,000 USDC worth of lUSDC.
2. `exchangeRateStored()` = 0.022 (stale; not updated since last accrual).
3. Actual current rate due to interest accrual: `exchangeRateCurrent()` = 0.025.
4. Attacker supplies 250,000 USDC via a flash loan.
5. lUSDC market mints `250000 / 0.025 = 10,000,000` lUSDC.
6. CoreRouter uses stale rate and calculates:
    ```solidity
    mintTokens = (250000) / 0.022 = 11,363,636
    ```
7. CoreRouter credits attacker with 11,363,636 lTokens, while it actually only received 10,000,000 from the lUSDC market.
8. So the attacker gains 1,363,636 lTokens out of thin air.
9. The attacker can now redeem 11,363,636 lTokens, which returns their original 250,000 USDC plus the additional 30,000 USDC ,effectively draining all the lUSDC held by the CoreRouter.




### Impact

The attacker can drain lTokens from the `CoreRouter` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace exchangeRateStored() with exchangeRateCurrent() to ensure lToken minting uses up-to-date exchange rates:
```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateCurrent(); 
```

This ensures accurate accounting that reflects accrued interest and prevents this attack vector.
