# Incorrect Liquidation Failure Refund Logic

## Summary
In the CrossChainRouter contract, the `_handleLiquidationFailure` function attempts to refund liquidators with tokens on the debt chain (Chain B), but the contract does not hold these tokens before the liquidation succeeds, causing liquidators to lose their funds if a cross-chain liquidation fails.

## Root Cause
In the [_handleLiquidationFailure](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L478-L486) function incorrectly attempts to transfer tokens to the liquidator that don't exist in the contract:

```solidity
function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
    address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

    // Refund the liquidator
    IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

    emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
}
```

The liquidator deposits repayment tokens on Chain B, but this function executes on Chain A where those tokens were never escrowed. This causes the refund transaction to revert or steal funds from other users if the contract happens to have those tokens.

## Internal pre-conditions
1. A user must have a cross-chain borrow position (collateral on Chain A, debt on Chain B)
2. A liquidator must execute a cross-chain liquidation that fails (e.g., due to price changes during execution)

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User supplies collateral on Chain A and borrows on Chain B
2. User's position becomes eligible for liquidation (health factor < 1)
3. Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain on Chain B, providing repayment tokens
4. The cross-chain message is sent to Chain A to seize collateral
5. The liquidation fails on Chain A (e.g., due to price recovery, concurrent liquidation, etc.)
6. Chain A sends a failure message back to Chain B
7. The `_handleLiquidationFailure` function on Chain A attempts to refund tokens that were actually deposited on Chain B
8. The transaction reverts or uses unrelated funds from the contract, causing liquidators to lose their deposit

## Impact
The impact of this bug is severe:

1. Liquidators permanently lose funds when cross-chain liquidations fail
2. This creates a significant disincentive for liquidators to participate in the protocol

## Mitigation
Implement proper cross-chain refund handling:

1. On Chain B (where the liquidation starts), escrow the repayment tokens until liquidation confirmation
2. On liquidation failure, handle the refund on Chain B where the tokens are actually held
3. Modify the contract architecture to ensure tokens are properly tracked across chains
