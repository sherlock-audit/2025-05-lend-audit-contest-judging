# Interest for cross-chain borrow is calculated with wrong index.

### Summary

Interest for cross-chain borrows should be calculated using the borrow index from the destination chain’s borrow market. However, the current implementation incorrectly uses the borrow index from the corresponding market on the source chain. These indexes can differ significantly due to variations in market launch times, borrow activity, and interest rates across chains. As a result, this bug can lead to either over-accrual or under-accrual of interest. In the case of under-accrual, borrowers may be able to withdraw collateral they shouldn't be entitled to, potentially putting the protocol at risk of bad debt.

```solidity
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
    Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

    require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");

    if (borrows.length > 0) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
            if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                // @audit-issue: Uses source chain's market index, which is incorrect
                borrowedAmount +=
                    (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

### Root Cause

The borrow interest is calculated using the borrow index from the source chain, rather than the borrow index of the market on the destination chain where the borrow actually occurs.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice takes a $1,000 cross-chain borrow.  
   - Source Chain (Chain A): Initial borrowIndex = 1.0  
   - Destination Chain (Chain B): Initial borrowIndex = 2.0  
   - The borrow is stored with:  
     - principle = $1,000  
     - borrowIndex = 2.0 (from destination chain)

2. Over time, borrow indexes change:  
   - Chain B borrowIndex increases from 2.0 to 2.2  
   - Chain A borrowIndex increases from 1.0 to 1.05

3. Alice attempts to  withdraw  collateral on Chain A, but during this Chain A incorrectly uses its own index:  
   - Incorrect borrow amount calculation:  
     $1,000 × (1.05 / 2.0) = **$525**

4. Correct borrow amount  calculation should be:  
   $1,000 × (2.2 / 2.0) = **$1,100**

5. Debt is underestimated by **$575**

6. Alice has $1,300 worth of ETH collateral.

7. With correct accounting, allowable withdrawal:  
   $1,300 - $1,100 = **$200**

8. With incorrect accounting, allowable withdrawal:  
   $1,300 - $525 = **$775**

9. Alice withdraws $775, which is **$575 more** than she should be allowed.

10. The protocol incurs **$575 in bad debt**.

  

### Impact

- Users may accrue less or more interest than intended.  
- Borrowers can unfairly withdraw more collateral than allowed.  
- The protocol becomes vulnerable to bad debt due to under-accrual.  
- Protocol will accrue bad debt (effecting protocol solvency)

### Mitigation

### Mitigation

Use the borrow index from the **destination chain’s market** when calculating interest on cross-chain borrows. 

To reliably obtain the correct borrow index from the destination chain, consider implementing a **cross-chain state-reading mechanism**, such as **LayerZero’s `lzRead`**, to fetch the current `borrowIndex` from the destination market.

During all **liquidity-consuming operations** (e.g., `borrow`, `redeem`,`crosschainBorrow`), follow this process:

1. Use `lzRead` or an equivalent cross-chain read method to **fetch the current `borrowIndex`** from the destination chain’s corresponding market.
2. Recalculate the user's actual borrow amount using the fetched current index:
   ```solidity
   actualBorrow = storedPrincipal × (destinationBorrowIndex / storedBorrowIndex)
   ```
3. Use this `actualBorrow` value in any liquidity/solvency check before allowing the operation.

This ensures accurate accounting of borrow interest and protects the protocol from undercollateralization  and bad debts.
