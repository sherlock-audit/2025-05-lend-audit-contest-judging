# Liquidation Affects Only a Small Subset of Users

### Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract allows users to borrow against their supplied assets, which exposes the protocol to liquidation risk. Unfortunately, it doesn’t handle liquidations well—losses only affect a small subset of users, and whoever redeems first gets their funds.

### Root Cause

The protocol currently lacks a mechanism to manage and distribute bad debt among users. When the protocol borrows from the `ltoken`, it becomes exposed to liquidation risk.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A supplier needs to borrow against their collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The price of collateral fluctuates or drop, making it exposed to liquidation.

2. Liquidation of the protocol’s collateral.

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

As a result, only a small subset of suppliers would bear the loss.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

I suggest adding functionality to distribute bad debt across all users instead of placing the entire loss on a small group of them.
