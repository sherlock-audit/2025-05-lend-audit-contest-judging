# Broken Logic In Redeem Functionality of the CoreRouter leads to profit for the redeemer

### Summary

In the [CoreRouter::redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100)


```solidity
  function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;  //@audit Integer division causing loss of funds

        // Perform redeem
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

        // Update total investment
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
        uint256 newInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) - _amount;
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, newInvestment);

        if (newInvestment == 0) {
            lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        }

        emit RedeemSuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, expectedUnderlying, _amount);

        return 0;
    }
```


We are updating the state variables correctly but we are not taking the corresponding lToken before transferring the underlying collateral token back to them that they supplied.

This means they can redeem their assets back without giving back the corresponding minted assets that have been minted to them in the `CoreRouter::supply()` function.
The underlying redeem transfers token to the protocol and the protocol transfers to the user. (The flow of the redeem functionality)

They can't redeem again as the state variables are updated but they have the minted lTokens.

This also causes a price discrepancy/price depeg betweenn the underlying collateral token and the lToken that's been minted,



### Root Cause

- Funds (LtOKEN) not being taken from the msg.sender before performing the underlying redeem function on `Lerc20.sol`
- Broken redeem functionality.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- User redeems their underlying collateral without paying the minted lTokens back.

### Impact

- Price discrepancy between lTokens and the Token leading to a huge depeg and a price fluctuation.
- Loss of funds for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement a safeTransfer function to take back the lTokens from the redeemer.
