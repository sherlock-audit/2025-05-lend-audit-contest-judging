# Unable to borrow cross chain despite collateral sufficiency

### Summary

The current mechanism is flawed that can cause the cross chain borrow to be failed even borrower has enough collateral

### Root Cause

The function [`CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113) is used to initiate a cross chain borrow from the source chain side. The function calculates the user's collateral on the source chain and then pass the collateral amount to the dest chain to proceed.

On the dest chain, the function [`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L581) handles the borrow request. It check the borrower's collateral `payload.collateral` with the existing borrow amount returned from `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. If the collateral is enough then it calls `CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain()` to execute borrow.
```solidity
    function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");

        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");

@>        require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

        IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    }
```
Here, the function can fail because indeed the collateral is provided on the source chain, then on dest chain the total collateral of `CoreRouter` contract (tracked by `LToken` and `Lendtroller`) remains. The call `LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount)` can revert because of many reasons, such that [`BorrowCashNotAvailable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L574-L577) or [shortfall of collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/Lendtroller.sol#L423-L425) from `CoreRouter` contract (as `CoreRouter` contract is the borrower of `LToken` contract), etc. So in the cases, the process of cross chain borrow will fail

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. Alice provides $2000 collateral on chain A
2. Bob provides $1000 collateral on chain B. Note that this collateral is actually credited to `CoreRouter` contract address, on chain B
3. Assume collateral factor = 80%, Alice borrows cross chain A->B with value $1200 by calling `borrowCrossChain()` and the transaction succeeds
4. LZ message received on chain B, and the function `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` is executed but it fails because it is unable to borrow $1200 with 1000$ collateral of `CoreRouter` contract.

### Impact

- Waste LZ message fees
- Core functionality broken

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider updating the cross chain borrow mechanism
