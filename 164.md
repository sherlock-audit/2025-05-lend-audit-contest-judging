# Cross-Chain Liquidation Token Address Mismatch Vulnerability

### Summary

A token address mismatch in cross-chain liquidation handling will cause a complete failure of the liquidation process for borrowers as liquidators will be unable to finalize liquidations after collateral has been seized, resulting in an inconsistent state across chains.


### Root Cause

In `src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol` the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function uses `payload.destlToken` (the collateral token from Chain A) as the borrow token parameter when calling `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` on Chain B:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to borrow assets cross-chain using the `borrowCrossChain` function
2. The collateral value on Chain A must fall below the required threshold for the loan on Chain B
3. A liquidator must attempt to liquidate the underwater position by calling `liquidateCrossChain`


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User borrows tokens on Chain B using collateral on Chain A
2. Collateral value drops, making the position eligible for liquidation
3. Liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B to initiate liquidation
4. System correctly seizes collateral on Chain A and sends a success message back to Chain B
5. On Chain B, `_handleLiquidationSuccess` is called with the Layer Zero payload
6. The function attempts to repay the borrow using `payload.destlToken` as the loan token
7. This operation will revert because `payload.destlToken` is the Chain A collateral token, not the Chain B loan token
8. The liquidation fails to complete, leaving the protocol in an inconsistent state

### Impact

The protocol suffers a critical failure in its liquidation mechanism. Borrowers' debt positions remain active even after their collateral has been seized, creating bad debt in the system. Liquidators suffer a loss of gas fees and opportunity cost, and may also have tokens locked in the contract. In extreme market conditions, this could lead to protocol insolvency as underwater positions cannot be properly liquidated.

### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect token address in the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function by either:

1. Looking up the correct borrow token using the source token and chain information:
```solidity
address borrowToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(payload.srcToken);
repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(
    payload.sender,
    payload.liquidator,
    payload.amount,
    borrowToken, // Corrected token address
    srcEid
);
```
