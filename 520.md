# `CrossChainRouter##repayCrossChainBorrow` allows for repaying on behalf- can lead to unfavorable conditions for the borrower

### Summary

Unlike the CoreRouter.sol or same chain for eg- The `CrossChainRouter.sol`'s allows for anyone to come and repay for the borrower. THIS in very likely situations and scenarios might not prove very favorable to the borrower.  [click here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L156C1-L162C6) See that there are different fields for the `borrower` and the `sender`. 

The unfavourable conditions can be for example lets say, a user supplies colllateral and then decides to borrow tokens for that that supplied collateral. This the user will do because in order to earn and accrue LEND rewards for him.

Lets just take a very simple and crisp example for understanding this issue:
1. A user as mentioned above supplies some amount of collateral asset. (Also lets say that this user doesnt borrow that much of a huge amount)
2. Then for that supply he borrows some tokens too
3. Why does this user is interacting with the protocol? Simply to borrow and along with that mostly he wants to accrue and earn his LEND rewards
4. Now after all this happens, Lets say that a malicious user comes and immediately after the borrower borrowed the tokens, the attacker repays his amount right in the next block.
5. Again there is not that big loss here for the borrower as his loan just got repaid. But however in case of a wealthy attacker , he can repeatedly repay the debt and make it so that borrower's LEND never gets accrued that much
That is due to the fact that the repayment will me done within very next block, so the delta will not be that big.

Note that there is some loss to the attacker here too, but at least he will end up greifing the borrower anyway



### Root Cause

Allowing of other users to repay the loans on behalf of the borrowers

### Internal Pre-conditions

User borrows using the cross chain functionality but not a  very big amount, as it else it might be expensive for attacker to even perform the greifing

### External Pre-conditions

Considering the borrower was not very rich and got a small amount of loan, after this the malicious user just need to repay and make the borrower avoid getting his LEND rewards accrued and claimed

### Attack Path

See summary/description

### Impact

Greifing of the borrower. the issue/attack leads to him not getting any LEND rewards for himself

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider something like whitelisting or only allowing for the borrowers who need someone to liquidate on their behalf, Moreover some access control in regards to this can also be implemented
