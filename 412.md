# Users can claim lendToken by borrowing

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L342

In LendStorage.sol

```solidity
function distributeSupplierLend(address lToken, address supplier) external onlyAuthorized {
        // ...
        // Update the accrued LEND for the account
        uint256 supplierAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[supplier], supplierDelta);
        lendAccrued[supplier] = supplierAccrued;
}

function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external onlyAuthorized {
        // ...        
        uint256 borrowerAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[borrower], borrowerDelta);
        lendAccrued[borrower] = borrowerAccrued;
}
```

The current reward distribution logic allows users to earn LEND tokens both as suppliers and as borrowers. When a user supplies assets and then borrows against them, their lendAccrued balance is increased from both the distributeSupplierLend() and distributeBorrowerLend() functions. 

As a result, when claimLend() is called, the user receives more rewards - one for supplying and another for borrowing.

### Impact

A user can receive more rewards without contributing any funds, resulting in unfair reward distribution.
As a consequence, other suppliers receive significantly reduced rewards.

So it's high impact


### PoC

In TestLendAccrual.t.sol

- Add following function

```solidity
function test_claim_by_borrow() public {

        address user3 = address(uint160(0x5555));
        // Supply different amounts with two users
        uint256 user1Supply = 50e18;
        uint256 user2Supply = 100e18;
        uint256 user3Supply = 50e18;
        
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(user1Supply, user1);
        _supply(user2Supply, user2);
        _supply(user3Supply, user3);


        address lendToken = lendtroller.getLendAddress();

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        coreRouter.borrow(50e18, token);
        

        vm.stopPrank();

        // Advance time
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1000);

        

        // Claim for both users
        address[] memory holders = new address[](3);
        holders[0] = user1;
        holders[1] = user2;
        holders[2] = user3;
        LToken[] memory lTokenArray = new LToken[](1);
        lTokenArray[0] = LToken(lToken);

        vm.prank(user1);
        coreRouter.claimLend(holders, lTokenArray, true, true);

        console2.log("token balance of user1 = ", IERC20(token).balanceOf(user1));
        
        console2.log("lend balance of user1 = ", IERC20(lendToken).balanceOf(user1));
        console2.log("lend balance of user2= ", IERC20(lendToken).balanceOf(user2));
        console2.log("lend balance of user3= ", IERC20(lendToken).balanceOf(user3));
        
    }
```

- Run comman

forge test --mt test_claim_by_borrow -vv

- Result

[PASS] test_claim_by_borrow() (gas: 1563727)
Logs:
  token balance of user1 =  50000000000000000000
  lend balance of user1 =  125000000000000000
  lend balance of user2=  50000000000000000
  lend balance of user3=  25000000000000000

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 7.24ms (1.99ms CPU time)



As result shows, user1 supply 50e18 and borrow 5018 again.  So deposit nothing.

But he received 2.5x reward than user2(supply 2x) and 5x reward than user3(supply 1x)


### Mitigation

Need to change claim logic so that borrower receives small reward.
