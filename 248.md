# Missing slippage protection in `supply()` and `redeem()` results in loss of funds

### Summary

During supply and redeem then `mintTokens` and `expectedUnderlying` are caclulated based on `exchangeRateBefore`. However, there is no check enforced to ensure that the calculated amounts are positive. This potentially results in situations where users supply funds or attempt to redeem but end up with `0` amounts in return.


### Root Cause

During [supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118) and [reddem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118) then `mintTokens` and `expectedUnderlying` are caclulated as follows:
```solidity
        // Get exchange rate before mint
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
>>      // @audit Misssing slippage protection: require(mintTokens > 0);
```
```solidity
        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

>>      // @audit Missing slippage protection: require(expectedUnderlying > 0);
```
However, as seen, these functions do not enforce any slippage.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Missing slippage enforcement

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User attempts to supply tokens or redeem their investments
2. Due to missing slippage handling, they wind up with no investment or underlying tokens in return
3. Funds are permanently lost

### Impact

Users stand to lose funds to the protocol during supply and redeem


### PoC

1. Add the following tests in `test/TestRedeeming.t.sol` and `test/TestSupplying.t.sol` respectively:
```solidity
    function test_loss_of_funds_in_redeem_due_to_mising_slippage_protection(uint256 amount) public {
        amount = 1e20;
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // First supply tokens
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

        // Asser user has positive invetsment
        uint256 userInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        assertGt(userInvestment, 0);

        uint256 redeemAmount = 1e8;

        coreRouter.redeem(redeemAmount, payable(lToken));

        // assert that user's investment reduced by 1e8
        assertEq(lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken), userInvestment - redeemAmount);

        // retrive undelying tokens received by user
        uint256 userTokenBalance = IERC20(lToken).balanceOf(deployer);
        // assert that user received 0
        assertEq(userTokenBalance, 0);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
```solidity
    function test_loss_of_funds_in_supply_due_to_mising_slippage_protection(uint256 amount) public {
        amount = 1e8;
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        address token = supportedTokens[0];
        address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

        // mint tokens
        ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, amount);

        // user current balance of token
        uint256 userTokenBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer);

        IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);

        // supply tokens as collateral
        coreRouter.supply(amount, token);

        // assert that user has been debited tokens
        assertEq(IERC20(token).balanceOf(deployer), userTokenBalance - amount);

        // However, user's investment is 0
        uint256 userInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
        assertEq(userInvestment, 0);    

        // user attempts to redeem: expect revert with Zero redeem amount
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Zero redeem amount"));
        coreRouter.redeem(userInvestment, payable(lToken));

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Enforce slippage protection as follows:
```diff
        // Get exchange rate before mint
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
+       require(mintTokens > 0, "Zero mint tokens");
```
```diff
        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
+       require(expectedUnderlying > 0, "Zero Underlying tokens");
```
