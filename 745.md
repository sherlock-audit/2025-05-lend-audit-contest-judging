### Attack Path

The protocol team will transfer ETH to the router to be used as gas for LayerZero's cross-chain messaging. All cross-chain operations (e.g., `borrowCrossChain`, `liquidateCrossChain`, `repayCrossChainBorrow`) in the `CrossCahinRouter` contract require ETH residing in the contract in order for the LayerZero's `_lzSend` cross-chain messaging to work because any cross-chain message send requires a fee.

However, the problem with this design is that a malicious user can drain all the ETH residing on the `CrossChainRouter` contract intended for LayerZero fee by making many unnecessary cross-chain operations, likely with a very small amount (e.g., opening a dust cross-chain borrow position or dust repayment)

When no ETH is residing in the router, all Cross-Chain operations on the router will be fail/revert and be DOSed.

```

### Impact

Loss of assets and core feature broken. It can lead to the loss of assets because if liquidation can be blocked or delayed, it will result in a loss for the protocol. If repayment cannot be performed or delayed by malicious user, users cannot repay or cannoty repay their debt in a timely manner, causing their debt to accumulate and their account eventually get liquidated unfairly.
