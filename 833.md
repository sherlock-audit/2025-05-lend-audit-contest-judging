# Supplier will receive incorrect `lTokens`, impacting their total supplied balance and rewards

### Summary

The supply function estimates `mintTokens` using a stale rate from `exchangeRateStored()`. Since that rate doesn’t include interest accrued up to the current block, the computed `mintTokens = _amount × 1e18 / exchangeRateStored` can be too high or too low. This leads to misstated `totalInvestment`, causing subsequent reward distributions and liquidity checks to be off.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);
        require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");
        require(_amount > 0, "Zero supply amount");
        // Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);
        // Get exchange rate before mint
        @> uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
        lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken);
        lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(_lToken, msg.sender);
        // Update total investment using calculated mintTokens
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + mintTokens
        );
        emit SupplySuccess(msg.sender, _lToken, _amount, mintTokens);
    }
```

Relying on `exchangeRateStored()` returns the last checkpointed exchange rate, which may be outdated if no interaction (e.g. borrow, redeem, or explicit accrueInterest) has occurred recently. Meanwhile, `mint()` itself calls `accrueInterest()`, updating the true rate before minting. The mismatch between the stale snapshot and the post-accrual rate causes the manual calculation to diverge from the actual `lTokens` issued.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Precondition: The market’s `exchangeRateStored()` is stale (e.g., hasn’t been updated in several blocks), so it underreports the true underlying-per-`lToken` value.
2. Snapshot Rate: The router reads `exchangeRateStored()` (say it’s 0.010 underlying per `lToken`).
3. Mint Call: `mint(amount)` calls `accrueInterest()` and updates the rate to, say, 0.0101. It then mints `amount / 0.0101 lTokens`.
4. Manual Calc: The router computes `mintTokens = amount / 0.0100` (the stale rate), yielding more lTokens than actually minted (≈1% extra).
5. Update Investment: `totalInvestment` is incremented by the inflated `mintTokens`.
6. Effect: The user’s recorded `lToken` balance exceeds their on-chain balance, causing over-distribution of rewards or erroneous liquidity calculations.

### Impact

1. **Reward Over-Distribution**: The supplier appears to hold more `lTokens` than they do, so `distributeSupplierLend` grants them additional LEND rewards on phantom tokens.
2. **Liquidity Miscalculations**: Functions that rely on `totalInvestment` (e.g., `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`) treat the user as having more collateral, potentially allowing unsafe borrows or withdrawals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the up-to-date exchange rate by calling `exchangeRateCurrent()` (which performs `accrueInterest()`) before computing `mintTokens`, or better yet, compute `mintTokens` exactly via the change in `lToken balanceOf` around the `mint()` call.
