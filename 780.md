# Cross-Chain Transactions May Fail Due to Incorrect Assumption of Address Ownership Across Chains

### Summary

The `CrossChainRouter` contract assumes that the `msg.sender` address on the source chain will correspond to a valid and controllable address on the destination chain. While this assumption holds true for EOAs, it does not hold for smart contract wallets (e.g., multisig or Account Abstraction wallets), whose addresses may not exist or be under the same ownership on the destination chain. This design flaw may cause cross-chain transactions attempts from such wallets to fail, or worse, succeed with funds being sent to an address not controlled by the original initiator.


### Root Cause

For example, in `borrowCrossChain()` function, which sends a payload to the destination chain via `_send()` using `msg.sender` as the borrower address. This assumes that the same address will be valid and under the userâ€™s control on the destination chain. 

```solidity
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
            collateral,
@>            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
```

```solidity
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
@>      address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
@>          abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }
```

However, this assumption does not hold in all cases:

- For smart contract wallets such as multisigs (e.g., Gnosis Safe) or Account Abstraction wallets (e.g., ERC-4337-based), the address is typically the result of a deterministic or factory-based deployment and may not exist or be deployed at the same address on other chains. These contracts must be explicitly deployed on each chain and may use different salts, owners, or factory contracts, leading to different addresses.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. User uses smart contract wallets for cross chain operations

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The issue particularly affecting users who utilize smart contract wallets, such as multisig or Account Abstraction wallets. These users may encounter significant challenges when engaging in cross-chain operations due to the assumption that the `msg.sender` address on the source chain is valid and controllable on the destination chain. 

This issue will leads to potential transaction failures if the corresponding address does not exist or is not under the same control on the destination chain.

A major consequence of this flaw is the potential loss of funds. If funds are sent to an address that is not controlled by the original initiator, users could face financial losses. Additionally, operational disruptions may occur, as users experience unexpected behavior or failures in cross-chain transactions.

**Mainly Affected functions:**

- [borrowCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L148): Initiates a cross-chain borrow operation, assuming `msg.sender` is valid on the destination chain.
- [liquidateCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L281): Initiates cross-chain liquidation, assuming the liquidator's address is valid across chains.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow the sender to specify the destination wallet address explicitly and add a signature check scheme to verify that the destination wallet address is indeed controlled by the user on the destination chain.
