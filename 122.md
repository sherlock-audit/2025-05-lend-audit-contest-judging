# CrossChainRouter will use incorrect collateral amount and token for debt repayment during cross-chain liquidation, disrupting the process for the protocol, liquidators, and borrowers

## Details

The `_handleLiquidationSuccess` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443) in `CrossChainRouter` is executed on Chain B after a successful collateral seizure on Chain A is reported via a LayerZero message. This function is intended to finalize the liquidation by settling the borrower's debt on Chain B, using funds provided by the liquidator. However, it contains critical flaws in how it identifies the debt and processes the repayment:

1.  **Incorrect Repayment Amount (`payload.amount`):**
    The function uses `payload.amount` from the LayerZero message as the amount to repay the debt on Chain B. This `payload.amount` actually represents `seizeTokens` â€“ the quantity of *collateral LTokens* seized on Chain A. The correct amount should be the original `repayAmount` (the quantity of *borrowed asset on Chain B*) that the liquidator specified when initiating the liquidation on Chain B. This original `repayAmount` is not available in the `LZPayload` received by `_handleLiquidationSuccess`.

2.  **Incorrect Repayment Token (`payload.destlToken`):**
    The function uses `payload.destlToken` as the LToken address for the debt being repaid on Chain B. This `payload.destlToken` is the address of the *collateral LToken on Chain A*. The repayment mechanism on Chain B (`repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` and subsequently `CoreRouter.repayCrossChainLiquidation`) expects the LToken address of the *borrowed asset on Chain B*.

3.  **Incorrect Borrow Position Lookup Key:**
    Before attempting the repayment, `_handleLiquidationSuccess` tries to locate the borrower's debt position on Chain B using `lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral`. The `underlying` token key for this lookup is derived from `lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken)` (i.e., the underlying of the *collateral LToken from Chain A*). The `crossChainCollaterals` mapping on Chain B is keyed by the *underlying of the borrowed asset on Chain B* (which is correctly available in `payload.srcToken`). This mismatch in lookup keys will most likely cause the `findCrossChainCollateral` call to fail and the entire `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function to revert with a "Borrow position not found" error.

## Root Cause

The `LiquidationSuccess` LayerZero message, sent from Chain A to Chain B, carries `payload.amount = seizeTokens` (quantity of collateral seized on Chain A) and `payload.destlToken = collateral_LToken_address_on_Chain_A`. The `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function on Chain B incorrectly:

1.  Uses `payload.destlToken` to derive the key for looking up the local debt record in `crossChainCollaterals`, instead of using `payload.srcToken` (which correctly identifies the borrowed asset's underlying on Chain B).
2.  Interprets `payload.amount` (collateral quantity) as the amount of borrowed asset to repay on Chain B.
3.  Interprets `payload.destlToken` (collateral LToken address from Chain A) as the LToken address for the debt on Chain B.

The fundamental issue is that the original `repayAmount` (of the borrowed asset on Chain B, specified by the liquidator) is not propagated through the LayerZero messages to `_handleLiquidationSuccess`.

## Internal Pre-conditions

*   A user has an active cross-chain borrowing position, with collateral deposited on Chain A and debt incurred on Chain B.
*   `LendStorage` correctly maps tokens and tracks the `crossChainCollaterals` (on Chain B) and `crossChainBorrows` (on Chain A) for this position.
*   `CoreRouter` and `CrossChainRouter` contracts are deployed and configured on both chains.

## External Pre-conditions

*   The borrower's position becomes undercollateralized and eligible for liquidation.
*   A liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B, providing the `repayAmount` (of borrowed asset on Chain B), the `srcEid` (Chain A's endpoint ID), `lTokenToSeize` (collateral LToken on Chain A), and `borrowedAsset` (on Chain B).
*   The `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message is successfully relayed via LayerZero from Chain B to Chain A.
*   Collateral seizure (`_handleLiquidationExecute`) on Chain A is successful.
*   The `LiquidationSuccess` message is successfully relayed via LayerZero from Chain A back to Chain B and triggers `_handleLiquidationSuccess`.

## Attacker Path (Illustrates the bug flow, not necessarily a malicious actor)

1.  A liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B for a borrower's position, specifying `repayAmount_B` (amount of borrowed asset on Chain B) and `lTokenCollateral_A` (collateral LToken on Chain A).
2.  `CrossChainRouter` on Chain B calculates `seizeTokens_A` (amount of `lTokenCollateral_A` to seize) based on `repayAmount_B`. It sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to Chain A with `payload.amount = seizeTokens_A`, `payload.destlToken = address_of_lTokenCollateral_A`, and `payload.srcToken = underlying_of_borrowed_asset_B`.
3.  `CrossChainRouter` on Chain A receives the message and successfully seizes `seizeTokens_A` of `lTokenCollateral_A` from the borrower.
4.  `CrossChainRouter` on Chain A sends a `LiquidationSuccess` message back to Chain B with the same `payload.amount = seizeTokens_A`, `payload.destlToken = address_of_lTokenCollateral_A`, and `payload.srcToken = underlying_of_borrowed_asset_B`.
5.  `CrossChainRouter` on Chain B receives this `LiquidationSuccess` message, and `_handleLiquidationSuccess` is executed:
    a.  It calculates `underlying_lookup_key = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken /* address_of_lTokenCollateral_A */)`. This key becomes the underlying of the collateral on Chain A.
    b.  It calls `lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral` using this incorrect `underlying_lookup_key`. The `crossChainCollaterals` map on Chain B is keyed by `underlying_of_borrowed_asset_B`. The lookup fails, causing the function to revert (typically with "Borrow position not found").
    c.  **Hypothetically, if the lookup succeeded** (e.g., if the borrowed asset's underlying on Chain B coincidentally matched the collateral's underlying on Chain A and other parameters in `findCrossChainCollateral` matched):
        i.  `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal` would be called with `_amount = seizeTokens_A` (quantity of collateral) and `_lToken = address_of_lTokenCollateral_A`.
        ii. This would attempt to repay `seizeTokens_A` units of `underlying_of_lTokenCollateral_A` by transferring them from the liquidator on Chain B, and then call `repayBorrow` on a contract (on Chain B) at `address_of_lTokenCollateral_A`. This process would almost certainly fail due to incorrect token types, amounts, or target LToken contract addresses.

## Impact

*   **Failure of Cross-Chain Liquidations:** The most direct impact is that cross-chain liquidations will systematically fail during the final debt repayment step on Chain B. The incorrect lookup key will likely cause a revert before the faulty repayment logic is even reached. This renders the cross-chain liquidation mechanism ineffective.
*   **Protocol Risk (Bad Debt):** If liquidations cannot be completed, undercollateralized cross-chain positions may accumulate bad debt, posing a financial risk to the protocol.
*   **Incorrect Accounting and Fund Mismanagement (if initial revert is bypassed):** In the unlikely scenario where the initial lookup succeeds, the subsequent attempt to repay the debt using the collateral's amount and token type would lead to severe accounting inconsistencies for the borrower's debt and the liquidator's payment. It could also lead to funds being stuck or misdirected if token transfers are attempted with mismatched assets.
*   **Liquidator Deterrence and Gas Loss:** Liquidators will be unable to perform their function for cross-chain borrows and will lose gas on transactions that inevitably fail, potentially deterring liquidation activity crucial for protocol health.
*   **Borrower's Debt Not Settled:** The borrower's debt on Chain B would remain outstanding or be incorrectly processed, leaving their financial position in an inconsistent state.
