# borrowCrossChain Incorrectly Adds Borrowed Asset to Supplied Assets Without Market Entry

### Summary

The [`borrowCrossChain`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L130) function calls `lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken)` where _lToken represents the borrowed token's lToken, not the user's actual collateral. This creates two issues: 1) The user is marked as having supplied an asset they're actually borrowing, and 2) Unlike CoreRouter.borrow(), no market entry occurs for the borrowed asset, creating inconsistent behavior between same-chain and cross-chain borrows.


### Root Cause

In `borrowCrossChain,` the `_lToken` variable is derived from the borrowed token, not the collateral token, however the token is added to the `userSuppliedAssets` this means that 
```javascript
/**
     * @notice Checks if a market is entered
     */
    function isMarketEntered(address user, address asset) internal view returns (bool) {
        address[] memory suppliedAssets = lendStorage.getUserSuppliedAssets(user);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length;) {
            if (suppliedAssets[i] == asset)  return true;
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
``` 
will return true and the protocol won't enter the market because:
```javascript
function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
    // _borrowToken is what user wants to borrow (e.g., USDC)
    address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_borrowToken); // Gets lUSDC
    
    //  BUG: Adds borrowed token's lToken to supplied assets
    lendStorage.addUserSuppliedAsset(msg.sender, _lToken); // Adds lUSDC as "supplied"
    
    if (!isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)) {
            enterMarkets(_lToken);
        }
}
```
Compare this to `CoreRouter.borrow()` which correctly enters the borrowed asset's market:
```javascript
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ... validation and health checks ...
    
    // Correctly enters the borrowed asset's market
    enterMarkets(_lToken);
    
    // Executes borrow and updates state correctly
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

User must initiate a cross-chain borrow via borrowCrossChain


### External Pre-conditions

Cross-chain infrastructure (LayerZero) must be operational



### Attack Path

No attack path, the protocol loses rewards on the token.

### Impact

This issue causes a mistracking of the user supplied assets, wasted gas as this array is looped through in `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` and more importantly protocol is subject to losing rewards since the token isn't taken into account. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Cross-chain borrowers miss out on Ltoken rewards.
