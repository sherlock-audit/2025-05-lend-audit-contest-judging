# Incorrect Double Application of Collateral Factor in Withdrawable Amount Calculation

### Summary

The `getMaxWithdrawable` function incorrectly applies the collateral factor twice when computing the maximum amount of `lTokens` a user can withdraw. This results in an underestimation of the user's withdrawable amount, limiting withdrawals unnecessarily and degrading user experience.

### Root Cause

The collateral factor is already applied during the computation of `sumCollateral` in the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` call. However, the same factor is applied again during the conversion from USD to tokens:

```solidity
uint256 tokensToDenom = (collateralFactor * exchangeRate * oraclePrice) / 1e36;
```
This causes the withdrawable amount to be scaled down twice, leading to incorrect behavior.



üõ†Ô∏è Correct Logic Comparison:

In a correct implementation, the collateral factor should only be applied once:

`sumCollateral` returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` already includes the collateral factor.

Therefore, when converting USD value back to tokens, the formula should be:

```solidity
tokensToDenom = (exchangeRate * oraclePrice) / 1e36;
```
This avoids applying the collateral factor again.

### Attack Path

Assume the user has:

1 ETH supplied as collateral

ETH price = $2,000

collateralFactor = 75% (i.e., 0.75e18)

exchangeRate = 1e18 (1:1 for simplicity)

No outstanding borrows

üßÆ Expected Behavior (correct logic)
getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() returns:

sumCollateral = 1 ETH * $2,000 * 0.75 = $1,500 (already includes collateral factor)

sumBorrowPlusEffects = $0 (no borrow)

So maxRedeemInUSD = $1,500

Conversion from USD back to lTokens (ETH):

```solidity
tokensToDenom = (exchangeRate * price) / 1e18
              = (1e18 * 2000e18) / 1e18 = 2000e18

redeemableLTokens = ($1,500 * 1e18) / 2000e18 = 0.75 ETH
```
‚úÖ This result is correct ‚Äî the user can withdraw 0.75 ETH safely.




‚ùå With the Bug (double applying collateral factor)
```solidity
tokensToDenom = (collateralFactor * exchangeRate * price) / 1e36
              = (0.75e18 * 1e18 * 2000e18) / 1e36
              = 1500e18
```
Then:

```solidity
redeemableLTokens = (1500e18 / 1500e18) = **1 ETH**
maxWithdrawUnderlying = (1 ETH * 1e18) / 1e18 = 1 ETH
```
‚ö†Ô∏è This appears incorrectly more favorable, but wait ‚Äî you‚Äôre using:

sumCollateral = $1,500 (already includes 0.75)

tokensToDenom = 0.75 applied again ‚Üí means you divide by a smaller number ‚Üí get more tokens than you should

This logic overstates the tokens a user can withdraw, potentially allowing them to exceed collateral limits and cause protocol insolvency.

But in your case, the current implementation is:

```solidity
uint256 redeemableLTokens = (maxRedeemInUSD * 1e18) / tokensToDenom;
```
With maxRedeemInUSD = 1,500, and tokensToDenom = 1500e18, so:

```solidity
redeemableLTokens = (1500e18) / 1500e18 = 1 ETH
```
And finally:

```solidity
maxWithdrawUnderlying = (1 ETH * 1e18) / 1e18 = 1 ETH
```
Now compare it to what it should be:

Realistic tokensToDenom = 2000e18

So redeemableLTokens = (1500e18 / 2000e18) = 0.75 ETH

‚ùóÔ∏èConclusion
You're accidentally letting the user redeem 1 ETH instead of 0.75 ETH, bypassing collateral safety. That could lead to undercollateralized positions, especially if followed by borrowing.

### Impact

Users are prevented from withdrawing the full amount of tokens they are entitled to.

This can:

Cause confusion and trust issues with the platform.

Harm integrations that rely on `getMaxWithdrawable()` for UX and liquidity routing.

Cause false assumptions of liquidity shortfall.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the calculation to remove the redundant application of the collateral factor:

```solidity
// Fix:
uint256 tokensToDenom = (exchangeRate * oraclePrice) / 1e36;
```
