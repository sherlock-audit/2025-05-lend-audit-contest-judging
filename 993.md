# Flawed State Cleanup Logic in `_updateRepaymentState`



## Finding description and impact

The `_updateRepaymentState` function manages borrower repayment processing and state updates. When a repayment fully satisfies the outstanding debt (`repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount`), the function eliminates the borrow position from `crossChainCollaterals` and conditionally removes the user from `userBorrowedAssets`.

**Current implementation:**
```solidity
lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
}
```

This implementation assumes that if `userCrossChainCollaterals` contained exactly one element before removal, the array will be empty afterward. Although this assumption is typically valid, the logic fails to verify the actual post-removal array state.

## Code snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L518-L522

**Root cause:**

The state validation relies on a pre-removal measurement of `userCrossChainCollaterals.length` rather than confirming the array's actual state following the `removeCrossChainCollateral` operation.

**Impact:**

* Users may be erroneously removed from `userBorrowedAssets` despite maintaining active borrowing positions
* Creates potential inconsistencies in the protocol's borrowing position tracking system
* Could compromise reward distribution mechanisms, collateral validation processes, or critical protocol safety features

## Mitigation

Modify the logic to evaluate the actual post-removal array state:

```solidity
lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);

if (lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(borrower, _token).length == 0) {
    lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
}
```

This approach guarantees that cleanup operations execute only when the user's borrowing positions are completely eliminated.
