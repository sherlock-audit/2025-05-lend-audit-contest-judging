# Cross-Chain Liquidation can lead to Collateral Seizure without Debt Repayment, harming the Borrower

### Summary

The incorrect sequencing of operations in the cross-chain liquidation process will cause a potential loss of collateral for the Borrower as a Liquidator will have their collateral seized on one chain before the Liquidator's repayment is confirmed on another chain, allowing for scenarios where repayment fails post-seizure

### Root Cause

 In CrossChainRouter.sol (specifically within the liquidateCrossChain function and its internal calls like _executeLiquidationCore), the LayerZero message to seize collateral on Chain A is sent before the liquidator's repayment funds are secured on Chain B. The repayment on Chain B is only attempted after Chain A confirms successful collateral seizure and sends a LiquidationSuccess message back

[CrossChainRouter.sol#L280-L290](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L264-L284) (_executeLiquidationCore sending LZ message before repayment)
[CrossChainRouter.sol#L438-L467](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443-L471) (_handleLiquidationSuccess attempting repayment after Chain A's success message)

This is a conceptual mistake in the design of the cross-chain liquidation flow. The choice to defer the liquidator's repayment on Chain B until after collateral seizure on Chain A is confirmed introduces a critical window where the protocol can enter an inconsistent and unfair state if the deferred repayment fails

### Internal Pre-conditions

1- A borrower has an active cross-chain loan, with collateral on Chain A and debt on Chain B

2- The borrower's position on Chain B becomes eligible for liquidation (e.g., health factor drops below the liquidation threshold)

### External Pre-conditions

A condition arises on Chain B that causes the liquidator's repayment transaction to fail after collateral has been seized on Chain A

### Attack Path

1- A Liquidator identifies a borrower's cross-chain position (collateral on Chain A, debt on Chain B) that is eligible for liquidation.

2- The Liquidator calls CrossChainRouter.liquidateCrossChain(borrower, repayAmount, srcEid_ChainA, lTokenToSeize_ChainA, borrowedAsset_ChainB) on Chain B.

3- CrossChainRouter on Chain B, via _executeLiquidationCore, calculates seizeTokens and sends a CrossChainLiquidationExecute LayerZero message to Chain A to seize seizeTokens of lTokenToSeize_ChainA. Crucially, no repayAmount has been transferred from the Liquidator on Chain B yet.

4- CrossChainRouter on Chain A receives the message, executes _handleLiquidationExecute, successfully seizes the borrower's collateral, and sends a LiquidationSuccess LayerZero message back to Chain B. The borrower's collateral on Chain A is now effectively under the control of the protocol/liquidator.

5- CrossChainRouter on Chain B receives the LiquidationSuccess message and calls _handleLiquidationSuccess.

6- _handleLiquidationSuccess calls repayCrossChainBorrowInternal, which eventually calls CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal on Chain B to attempt to transfer repayAmount of borrowedAsset_ChainB from the Liquidator.

7- This token transfer from the Liquidator on Chain B fails (e.g., due to insufficient funds, lack of approval, or the liquidator front-running/revoking approval after initiating the liquidation but before this step). The transaction processing the LiquidationSuccess message on Chain B reverts.

8- The LayerZero message might be retried by a relayer, but if the underlying condition causing the repayment failure persists (e.g., liquidator intentionally ensuring funds/approval are missing), all retries will fail.

### Impact

The Borrower suffers a complete loss of their seized collateral on Chain A, while their debt on Chain B remains unpaid. The protocol is left in an inconsistent state

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The cross-chain liquidation process in CrossChainRouter.sol must be redesigned to ensure atomicity, specifically that the liquidator's repayment on the debt chain (Chain B) is secured before a command is sent to seize collateral on the collateral chain (Chain A)
