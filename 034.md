# Inaccurate Removal of Borrowed Asset Causes Incorrect Liquidity Calculation

### Summary

Missing validation of total (same-chain + cross-chain) debt before removing borrowed asset tracking will cause an inaccurate debt calculation for the protocol as a malicious user will repay only one type of debt, trigger asset removal, and exploit getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral to borrow more or redeem excess collateral


### Root Cause

The protocol maintains a list of borrowed assets per user using userBorrowedAssets. This list is used in getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() to compute the user's borrow value and collateral ratio by iterating through the assets in this list.

However, in the repayBorrowInternal() function:

```solidity
repayBorrowInternal(){
...
        if (_isSameChain) {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(borrower, _lToken);
        }

      if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
          lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
          lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken); //<--- Problematic
      }
```

removeUserBorrowedAsset is called whenever the repaid amount equals the borrowedAmount passed to the function, regardless of whether that amount accounts for both same-chain and cross-chain borrows.

Since borrowWithInterestSame and borrowWithInterest are used separately based on the _isSameChain flag, only one component of the total debt is considered. If a user has debt on both chains, repaying one and triggering this logic will prematurely remove the borrowed asset from the tracking list, despite debt still remaining on the other chain.

As a result, in getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral, the asset is no longer present in userBorrowedAssets:

```solidity
...
address[] memory borrowedAssets = userBorrowedAssets[account].values();
...
   // Second loop: Calculate borrow value from borrowed assets
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length;) {
            LToken asset = LToken(borrowedAssets[i]);

            // Get borrow balance for this asset
            uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));

            // Add cross-chain borrows if any
            totalBorrow += borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset));

}
```

This omission causes the function to underestimate the user’s borrow total.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Same borrow tokens are added to protocol for different chains
User borrows the same tokens for both current chain and another chain

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. User A borrows 100 units of asset X on Chain A and 100 units on Chain B (cross-chain).
2. Total borrow: 200 units.
3. userBorrowedAssets includes asset X.
4. User repays only the same-chain debt (100 units) 
5. Since repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount, the contract:
     Calls removeUserBorrowedAsset and removes asset X from the borrow tracking list.
6. In a later collateral check (getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral):
    Cross-chain borrow of 100 units is ignored.
7. User appears to have less dept than real amounts
8. User borrows more or redeems more than allowed.

### Impact

the getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() function, which checks a user’s total borrow and collateral values, skips this asset entirely because it’s no longer tracked in userBorrowedAssets.
 The protocol ignores remaining real debt, and the user might:
- Be allowed to borrow more,
- Redeem more collateral,

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update repayBorrowInternal logic to:
- Check combined borrow amounts (same-chain + cross-chain).
- Only call removeUserBorrowedAsset after confirming all debt is cleared:
