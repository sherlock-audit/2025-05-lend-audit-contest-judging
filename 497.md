# Users can receive duplicate LEND rewards due to missing claim status checks

### Summary

The lack of claim status validation in `CoreRouter::claimLend()` will cause duplicate token distributions as the function always processes rewards for all holders without checking if they've already claimed.

### Root Cause

the [claimLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L370) function distributes LEND tokens to holders without checking if they have already claimed their rewards for the given period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. LEND rewards must be available
2. Multiple holders must exist
3. Someone calls claimLend() multiple times with same holders

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. LEND rewards accumulate for holders
2. Someone calls claimLend() with list of holders
3. Rewards are distributed through [grantLendInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L421) function
4. Same call can be made again immediately
5. Holders receive duplicate rewards

### Impact

- Incorrect distribution of protocol rewards
- Some users receive more LEND tokens than entitled

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add claim status tracking.
