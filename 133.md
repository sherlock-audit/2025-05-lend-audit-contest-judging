# Gas fee is not estimated correctly while sending cross chain message

### Summary

When sending a cross-chain message using `_lzSend`, the `nativeFee` must be provided as a parameter. In this implementation, it is passed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) via the `MessagingFee` struct.  

The issue is that the entire contract balance is being used as the native gas fee, rather than estimating the required fee using LayerZeroâ€™s `quote` function.  

This can lead to a potential loss of excess value and cause DoS.  

Relevant documentation can be found [here](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#estimating-gas-fees).

### Root Cause

The entire contract balance is sent as a gas fee when sending a cross-chain message using `_lzSend` instead of estimating the gas fee using LayerZero's `quote` function


### Impact

If the contract balance is not enough to cover gas fees on the destination chain, the entire call will be reverted, causing DoS to many important cross-chain functions like `borrowCrossChain`, `liquidateCrossChain` and `repayCrossChainBorrow`

Also, if an excess amount is sent as a gas fee, then it will be permanently lost. Generally,LayerZero refunds unused fees to the specified refund address. But in this case, the refund address is [CrossChainRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L820) contract address. 

According to the layerzero [docs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#implementing-_lzsend) - 

> If your refund address is a smart contract, you will need to implement a fallback function in order for it to receive the refund.

However, the `CrossChainRouter` contract lacks a `fallback` function implementation

This could potentially lead to the loss of excess fees, as LayerZero will be unable to refund them.

Taking into consideration all this factors I think it is a valid high.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Estimate gas fees using LayerZero's quote function - 

```solidity 
/* @dev Quotes the gas needed to pay for the full omnichain transaction.
 * @return nativeFee Estimated gas fee in native gas.
 * @return lzTokenFee Estimated gas fee in ZRO token.
 */
function quote(
    uint32 _dstEid, // Destination chain's endpoint ID.
    string memory _message, // The message to send.
    bytes calldata _options, // Message execution options
    bool _payInLzToken // boolean for which token to return fee in
) public view returns (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 lzTokenFee) {
    bytes memory _payload = abi.encode(_message);
    MessagingFee memory fee = _quote(_dstEid, _payload, _options, _payInLzToken);
    return (fee.nativeFee, fee.lzTokenFee);
}
