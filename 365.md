# Costly Loops and Gas Limit Risk in Borrow and Collateral Operations

### Summary

Several functions in the Lend protocol perform loops over user-specific arrays (Borrow[]), potentially leading to gas limit exhaustion when the array size grows significantly. This vulnerability affects functions such as getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral, borrowWithInterest, findCrossChainBorrow, and findCrossChainCollateral.

Without safeguards, users with a large number of entries in Borrow[] arrays can inadvertently or maliciously cause transactions to fail due to excessive gas consumption.



### Root Cause

The system utilizes unbounded loops over arrays stored in mappings (mapping(address => Borrow[])).

No limits are imposed on the number of entries a user can create in these arrays, allowing unchecked growth.

Functions dependent on these loops can exceed the blockchain's gas limit, rendering them unusable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Functions like borrowWithInterest and findCrossChainBorrow iterate over Borrow[] arrays without constraints on their size.

No mechanism exists to break down or batch-process these operations.

The system assumes that the size of the arrays will remain within manageable limits.



### External Pre-conditions

Users are allowed to perform multiple cross-chain borrow or collateral actions without restriction, leading to large Borrow[] arrays.

High network gas prices or network congestion exacerbate the risk by reducing the effective number of operations that can be processed within a transaction.



### Attack Path

A malicious user repeatedly invokes actions such as addCrossChainBorrow or addCrossChainCollateral, populating Borrow[] arrays for a specific token and user address.

The attacker grows the array to a size where operations like borrowWithInterest or findCrossChainBorrow exceed the gas limit.

As a result, the attacker causes denial of service for the affected functions, disrupting protocol operations.



### Impact

Gas Limit Exhaustion: Functions fail for users with large Borrow[] arrays, resulting in a denial of service.

Operational Risk: Critical features such as borrow calculations and collateral validation become unusable for affected users.

Security Risk: A malicious actor could intentionally exploit this to target specific functions or users.

### PoC

The following example demonstrates how large Borrow[] arrays can lead to gas limit exhaustion:

```solidity
// Setup
address user = 0x123; // Example user
address token = 0xABC; // Example token

// Add excessive entries
for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    Borrow memory borrowEntry = Borrow({
        srcEid: 1,
        destEid: 2,
        principle: 100e18,
        borrowIndex: 1e18,
        borrowedlToken: address(0xDEF),
        srcToken: token
    });
    lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(user, token, borrowEntry);
}

// Trigger function
uint256 borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterest(user, address(0xDEF));
// Result: Transaction fails due to gas limit exhaustion.
```

### Mitigation

Entry Limitations:

Introduce a maximum limit on the number of entries per user for Borrow[] arrays. For example:

```solidity
uint256 constant MAX_BORROW_ENTRIES = 100;
require(crossChainBorrows[user][underlying].length <= MAX_BORROW_ENTRIES, "Exceeds max entries");
```
Batch Processing:

Refactor functions to process entries in smaller, manageable chunks:

```solidity
function processBorrowsInBatch(address user, uint256 startIndex, uint256 batchSize) external {
    Borrow[] storage borrows = crossChainBorrows[user];
    uint256 endIndex = startIndex + batchSize > borrows.length ? borrows.length : startIndex + batchSize;
    for (uint256 i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
        // Process borrow entry
    }
}
```
Optimized Data Structures:

Replace arrays with mappings for faster and more scalable access.

Early Validation:

Perform gas cost estimation during entry addition to prevent operations that might exceed gas limits.

User Notifications:

Inform users of the limitations and provide tools to manage or clean up old entries.
