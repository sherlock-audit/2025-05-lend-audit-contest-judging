# Max Borrow Amount Bug in LendStorage

### Summary

The incorrect return value in `LendStorage.getMaxBorrowAmount` will cause an undercollateralized position for the lending protocol as an attacker will borrow excessive tokens by misinterpreting the USD-based borrow amount as a token amount.


### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol:524` there is an incorrect return value in the `getMaxBorrowAmount` function, which returns the maximum borrow amount in USD terms (scaled to 18 decimals) instead of the underlying token's units, leading to excessive borrowing when misinterpreted as a token amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `addSupportedTokens` to set `underlyingTolToken[token]` to a valid `lToken` address.
2. User needs to supply collateral to set `totalInvestment[user][lToken]` to be at least `1000e18` tokens.
3. Collateral factor in `Lendtroller.getCollateralFactorMantissa(lToken)` to be other than `0`.
4. Exchange rate in `LTokenInterface.exchangeRateStored()` to be exactly `1e18` initially.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price oracle needs to set the token price to go from `1e18` to `2e18` within the same block or transaction sequence.
2. Gas price needs to be at least sufficient to execute `coreRouter.borrow` (e.g., 20 gwei).

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `coreRouter.supply(1000e18, token)` to supply 1000 tokens as collateral, valued at $1000 with an initial token price of $1.
2. The admin or oracle updates the token price to $2 by calling `priceOracle.setDirectPrice(token, 2e18)`.
3. The user calls `lendStorage.getMaxBorrowAmount(deployer, lToken)`, which returns `1500e18` (in USD terms, due to a collateral factor or exchange rate effect).
4. The user calls `coreRouter.borrow(1000e18, token)`, interpreting the `1500e18` USD as 1000 tokens, borrowing $2000 worth of tokens against $750-$1000 collateral capacity.

### Impact

The lending protocol suffers an approximate loss of up to 100% of the collateral value due to undercollateralized positions. The attacker gains excessive tokens (e.g., $2000 worth against $1000 collateral).

**Test Result**:

[FAIL: Max borrow amount should be in USD terms: 1500000000000000000000 != 1000000000000000000000] test_max_borrow_amount_bug() (gas: 472362)
```

The test fails because `getMaxBorrowAmount` returns `1500e18` (USD terms, possibly due to a collateral factor > 1 or exchange rate effects), but the borrowing of `1000e18` tokens (worth $2000 at $2/token) succeeds, exceeding the collateral capacity (e.g., $750-$1000), confirming the bug

### Mitigation

Update `getMaxBorrowAmount` to return the borrow amount in the underlying tokenâ€™s units by converting the USD-based value using the oracle price and token decimals
