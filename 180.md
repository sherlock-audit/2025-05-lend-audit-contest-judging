# A malicious user can withdraw his collateral in between a cross-chain borrow.

### Summary

In a cross-chain borrow operation, the current flow allows the user’s collateral to remain unlocked until the `ValidBorrowRequest` message is processed on the source chain. This opens a critical window during which the user can withdraw their collateral after receiving borrowed funds on the destination chain, but before their debt is recorded on source chain. As a result, the protocol becomes vulnerable to bad debt.

### Root Cause

During the cross-chain borrow process, the user's collateral is **not locked at the time of borrow initiation**. Instead, collateral is locked only when the `ValidBorrowRequest` message is processed, which happens after the funds have already been disbursed to the user on the destination chain. This delay allows the user to withdraw their collateral before the borrow is accounted for, bypassing protocol checks and creating bad debt.

**Current Flow:**

1. User initiates a cross-chain borrow request.
2. Destination chain validates the collateral and sends borrowed tokens to the user.
3. Destination chain sends a `ValidBorrowRequest` message back to the source chain.
4. Source chain records the borrow and locks collateral.

**Expected Flow:**

1. Collateral is locked immediately upon borrow initiation on the source chain.
2. Borrow is executed on the destination chain.
3. If borrow fails, collateral is unlocked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.


### Attack Scenario

1. Alice supplies 1000 USDC as collateral on Ethereum.
2. She initiates a cross-chain borrow of 950 USDC on Arbitrum.
3. On Arbitrum, the liquidity check passes (collateral = 1000 > borrow = 950).
4.  950 USDC  will be transferred to Alice  on Arbitrum and a `ValidBorrowRequest` message will be sent to Ethereum.
5. Before `CrossChainRouter` on Ethereum processes the request and records the borrow, Alice withdraws her 1000 USDC collateral.
6. Later, the `ValidBorrowRequest` is executed and adds a 950 USDC borrow to Alice's account, but her collateral is already gone.
7. The protocol is now left with 950 USDC of unbacked debt, i.e., bad debt .

### Impact

This vulnerability allows users to obtain under-collateralized loans and results in irreversible bad debt to the protocol. 

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

_Not provided._

###  Mitigation

To prevent this issue:

- **Collateral must be locked immediately** upon initiation of the cross-chain borrow request.
- Introduce a temporary "pending borrow" state on the source chain where the user’s collateral is locked.
- Once the destination chain confirms the borrow via a `ValidBorrowRequest`, the borrow is finalized.
- If the destination chain fails or reverts the borrow, unlock the user’s collateral on the source chain.
