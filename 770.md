# Max repay amount calculation is wrong during liquidation

### Summary

During liquidation maxClose amount is calculated based on the principal only, interests are not being included. Thus full liquidation is not possible

### Root Cause

[close factor mantissa is applied to the principal only](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L354)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.user borrowed
2. interest accrued on the loan

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

1. Honest liquidators can experience DoS when trying to fully liquidate a bad loan.
2. Protocol will still incur bad debt, because only the initial principal amount will be liquidated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
                Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), (borrowBalance.amount * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex
            );
```
