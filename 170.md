# LEND Rewards Not Reset After Claim, Allowing Indefinite Reclaims

### Summary

`CoreRouter.sol#claimLend()` calls `grantLendInternal()` to transfer accrued LEND tokens to users but does not reset the accrued balance after transfer. As a result, users can repeatedly claim the same rewards indefinitely.

### Root Cause

`grantLendInternal()` transfers the accrued LEND tokens to the user but does not reset the transferred amount from the user’s accrued balance (`lendAccrued`). Consequently, the accrued rewards remain unchanged, allowing repeated claims of the same amount. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L421).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has a non-zero accrued LEND balance.

2. The contract holds a sufficient LEND token balance to cover the transfer.

3. `claimLend()` function is called with the user’s address included in holders.

4. The system relies on lendAccrued to track claimable rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `claimLend()`, triggering the calculation and accumulation of their accrued LEND.

2. `grantLendInternal()` transfers the accrued LEND tokens but does not reset the user’s accrued balance to zero.

3. Since the accrued balance remains unchanged, the user can repeatedly call `claimLend()` to claim the same rewards multiple times, effectively receiving LEND tokens indefinitely.

### Impact

Users can indefinitely claim LEND rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

After successfully transferring LEND tokens in `grantLendInternal()`, reset the user’s accrued LEND balance to zero to prevent repeated claims of the same rewards.
