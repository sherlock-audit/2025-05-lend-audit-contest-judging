# Unexpected Revert Due to Lack of Checks for Supported Token Addresses in the `CoreRouter` Contract

## Vulnerability Details
There are mapping variables defined in the `LendStorage` contract named `lTokenToUnderlying` and `underlyingToLToken`. The primary purpose of these variables is to establish the pairing between underlying tokens and their corresponding cTokens, ensuring only supported tokens are used. This mechanism helps prevent interactions with unsupported tokens, as demonstrated in the `supply` function:

```solidity
require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");
```

However, **similar checks are not present in other functions**. As a result, if a user mistakenly calls these functions with an unsupported token as an input, it can lead to unexpected reverts.

## POC

In the test below, calling the `redeem` function with a random `cToken` address as input reverts due to insufficient balance at ([CoreRouter.sol, Line 124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124)), not because of an unsupported token.


```solidity
function testRedeemUnexpectedRevert() public {
    // @auditor: the test bellow fails due to insufficient balance not 
    uint256 amount = 5e18;
    vm.startPrank(deployer);

    (address token, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

    uint256 initialLTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);

    address randomTokenAddress = makeAddr("randomTokenAddress");
    // @auditor: instead of lToken, random address is the input. 
    coreRouter.redeem(initialLTokenBalance, payable(randomTokenAddress));
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

Copy the above code into the `TestRedeeming.t.sol` file.

## Impact
Potential unexpected reversion without any message displayed to users.

## Mitigation
Similar to the `supply` function, add a check for the zero address in other functions of the `CoreRouter` contract.
