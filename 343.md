# Cross-chain Borrow Is Added Before Distributing LEND

### Summary

In `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`, the cross-chain borrow is added to storage before distributing LEND rewards. This causes the new borrow to be included in the reward calculation. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L659)

### Root Cause

The function `distributeBorrowerLend()` is called after the user's borrow is added to storage (`addUserBorrowedAsset()`), which causes the newly added borrow to be included in the reward calculation within the same transaction. This results in premature reward accrual based on a borrow that has not yet been finalized.

### Attack Path

1. Let LEND rewards accumulate over time without calling `distributeBorrowerLend()`. The borrower's index (`lendBorrowerIndex`) remains outdated.

2. When enough rewards have accumulated, call `borrowCrossChain()` with a large borrow amount.

3. On the destination chain, the function `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`:

Adds the new borrow to storage immediately (`addUserBorrowedAsset()`).

Then calls `distributeBorrowerLend()`, which:

Uses the new, inflated borrow amount as the borrower's balance.

Calculates `deltaIndex` based on the time that has passed since the last distribution.

4. This results in LEND rewards being accrued on the full borrow amount, as if it was held the entire time.

5. The user gets significantly more LEND than they should have, effectively farming historical rewards using a new borrow.

### Impact

Users can accrue excessive LEND rewards on new large borrows, resulting in unearned emissions and unfair reward distribution that harms the protocolâ€™s incentive integrity.
