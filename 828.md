# Stale `borrowIndex` in `redeem()` Leads to Incorrect Liquidity Checks

## Title (submitted)
Stale `borrowIndex` in `redeem()` Leads to Incorrect Liquidity Checks

## Summary
The `redeem()` function fails to accrue interest before calling `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function, potentially using a stale `borrowIndex` when calculating borrowed amounts. This can result in incorrect liquidity checks, allowing users to redeem collateral even when they should be liquidated.

## Root Cause
The fundamental issue stems from the [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100-L138) function's failure to call `accrueInterest()` before processing redemption requests. In lending protocols, the borrow index continuously grows to reflect accumulated interest over time. When interest is not accrued before liquidity calculations, the system uses outdated borrow index values, creating a temporal discrepancy between actual and calculated debt positions.

## Internal Pre-conditions
User must have an open borrow position.
Interest must have accrued since the last `borrowIndex` update.
User attempts to redeem collateral while undercollateralized (but stale data hides this).

## External Pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. User calls the `redeem()` function
2. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is called to validate redemption safety
3. Function uses outdated `borrowIndex` from the last accrual event
4. Borrowed amounts are calculated using stale index, underestimating actual debt
5. Protocol allows redemptions that should be restricted based on current debt levels

## Impact
Users can redeem more collateral than what they should actually redeem hence the protocol exposure to bad debt increases

## POC
None

## Mitigation
Call `accrueInterest()` at the start of `redeem()`
```diff
        function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
+       LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
    }
```
