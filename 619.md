# Wrong Redeem Amount Transferred

### Summary

The `redeem()` function in `CoreRouter` calculates the amount of underlying tokens to transfer to the user (`expectedUnderlying`) using the exchange rate **before** the redeem call. However, the actual amount of underlying tokens received by the contract after redeeming lTokens may differ, because the `redeem()` function in the LToken contract first accrues interest (via `accrueInterest()`) and then computes the exchange rate. This mismatch can result in the user receiving less (or more) than they should, leaving tokens stranded in the contract or causing overpayment.

### Root Cause

- `CoreRouter.redeem()` calculates `expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18` using the exchange rate **before** calling `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)`.
- Inside `LErc20.redeem()`, the LToken contract calls `redeemInternal()`, which in turn calls `accrueInterest()` before calculating the actual amount of underlying tokens to redeem.
- If interest has accrued since the last update, the exchange rate after `accrueInterest()` will be higher, so redeeming the same number of lTokens will yield **more** underlying tokens than estimated by `CoreRouter`.
- As a result, `CoreRouter` transfers only the pre-calculated (lower) amount to the user, leaving the surplus in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The LToken contract's `accrualBlockNumber` is less than the current block, so `accrueInterest()` will update the exchange rate.
- The user calls `CoreRouter.redeem()` with a nonzero `_amount` of lTokens.
- The contract calculates `expectedUnderlying` using the old exchange rate.

### External Pre-conditions

- There is a time gap between the last interest accrual and the current redeem transaction, so the exchange rate will increase when `accrueInterest()` is called.
- The protocol allows users to redeem lTokens at any time.

### Attack Path

1. A user holds 100 lTokens. The last exchange rate was 1.00, so `expectedUnderlying = 100 * 1.00 = 100`.
2. The user calls `CoreRouter.redeem(100, ...)`.
3. `CoreRouter` calculates `expectedUnderlying = 100`.
4. `LErc20.redeem(100)` is called, which triggers `accrueInterest()`. Suppose the new exchange rate is now 1.05.
5. The LToken contract redeems 100 lTokens for 105 underlying tokens and sends them to `CoreRouter`.
6. `CoreRouter` transfers only 100 tokens to the user, leaving 5 tokens stranded in the contract.

### Impact

- Users receive less than the correct amount of underlying tokens when redeeming, with the surplus accumulating in the contract.
- Over time, this can lead to a significant amount of stranded tokens, which are not easily recoverable.
- Alternatively, if the exchange rate decreases (unlikely in lending protocols), users could be overpaid, causing protocol losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of pre-calculating the amount to transfer, `CoreRouter` should measure the contract's underlying token balance **before and after** the redeem operation, and transfer the **actual** difference to the user:
    1. Record `balanceBefore = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))`.

    2. Call `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)`.

    3. Record `balanceAfter = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))`.

    4. Transfer `balanceAfter - balanceBefore` to the user.
