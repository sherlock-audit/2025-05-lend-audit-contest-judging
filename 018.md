# Borrower will over-borrow beyond collateral limits affecting lending protocol

### Summary

Incorrect liquidity check in borrow function will cause insolvency risk for the lending protocol as borrowers will exceed their borrowing capacity due to improper collateral verification.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol` the liquidity check uses pre-borrow debt amount (`borrowAmount`) instead of post-borrow debt amount (`borrowed`) for collateral verification. The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` call properly calculates the post-borrow debt (`borrowed` parameter) which includes the new borrow amount, but the subsequent check incorrectly uses the pre-borrow debt value (`borrowAmount`).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower must have an existing borrow position where `currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0`
2. Borrower's collateral value must be between `borrowAmount` (pre-borrow debt) and `borrowed` (post-borrow debt) values
3. `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` must return `collateral > borrowAmount` but `collateral < borrowed`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Asset prices must remain stable during the borrow operation (no significant price fluctuations between liquidity check and actual borrow)

### Attack Path

1. Borrower calls `borrow()` with amount `X`
2. System calculates hypothetical liquidity:
   - `borrowed` = (current debt + `X`) in USD terms
   - `collateral` = current collateral value in USD terms
3. System incorrectly checks `collateral >= borrowAmount` (pre-borrow debt) instead of `collateral >= borrowed` (post-borrow debt)
4. Borrow operation executes successfully even when `borrowed > collateral`
5. Borrower's position becomes undercollateralized immediately after borrowing

### Impact

The protocol suffers increased insolvency risk as undercollateralized positions cannot be liquidated profitably. Repeated exploitation could lead to protocol bankruptcy where bad debt exceeds reserve funds. Each successful attack directly converts protocol assets into non-recoverable bad debt.

### PoC

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDC (collateral factor 80%) as collateral → $800 borrowing power
2. Alice borrows 500 DAI → current borrow: $500
3. Alice attempts to borrow 400 DAI more:
   - `borrowed` = $500 (existing) + $400 (new) = $900
   - `collateral` = $800
   - `borrowAmount` = $500 (existing debt)
4. System checks `$800 >= $500` → passes
5. Alice successfully borrows despite $900 > $800 collateral coverage
6. Position is immediately undercollateralized by $100

### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect collateral check with proper post-borrow debt verification:

```solidity
// CoreRouter.sol
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = 
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            msg.sender, 
            LToken(payable(_lToken)), 
            0, 
            _amount
        );
    
    // Remove borrowAmount calculation and incorrect check
    // uint256 borrowAmount = ... // DELETE THIS LINE
    
    // Add proper collateral verification
    require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    // ... rest of function ...
```
