# Users can borrow new assets with zero collateral due to skipped checks and flawed debt scaling

### Summary

In `CoreRouter.borrow`, the collateral check is effectively bypassed on a user’s first borrow of any given token and, on subsequent borrows, mixes unrelated debt values with a per-market index ratio. Specifically:

- If the user has never borrowed the target asset before, the code sets the required borrow value to 0, allowing unlimited, under-collateralized borrowing.

- Even after the first borrow, the contract compares “all‐market borrowed USD value” (including debts from other tokens) scaled by the new/old borrow‐index of this one market against total collateral—an incorrect formula that has nothing to do with isolating this market’s debt.

As a result, a user can open a fresh borrow in any market without collateral, and any subsequent borrow check remains logically unsound.

### Root Cause

```solidity
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(user, this_lToken);
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? (allBorrowedUSD * newIndex) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex
    : 0;
require(collateralUSD >= borrowAmount);
```

When `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0` (i.e. user has never borrowed this lToken), the code forces `borrowAmount = 0` → `require(collateralUSD ≥ 0)` always passes. Thus, no collateral is checked at all on a first‐time borrow in any market.


Also on any subsequent borrow of the same asset (when `borrowIndex ≠ 0`), `allBorrowedUS`D (which includes debts from every other token the user has borrowed) is multiplied by `newIndex / oldIndex` of the target lToken.

That formula makes no sense: “other‐token USD debt” should not be scaled by “this token’s `borrowIndex` ratio.” It neither isolates this market’s existing debt nor enforces a correct total‐collateral check.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None required to exploit the zero‐check path. However, if a user already has debt in other markets, the subsequent‐borrow formula remains incorrect (although “first borrow” already breaks the protocol).

### Attack Path
**Zero‐Collateral First Borrow**
1. Alice has never borrowed DAI before (so `getBorrowBalance(Alice, lDAI).borrowIndex == 0`) and she holds zero collateral in every market.
2. Alice calls CoreRouter.borrow(1 DAI, addressOfDAI).
3. Internally:
- `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(Alice, lDAI, 0, 1 DAI)` returns `(allBorrowedUSD + newBorrowUSD, totalCollateralUSD)`, but `allBorrowedUSD = 0` and `totalCollateralUSD = 0`.
- `currentBorrow = getBorrowBalance(Alice, lDAI) has borrowIndex == 0`.
- Because `borrowIndex == 0`, the code sets `borrowAmount = 0`.
- It checks `require(collateralUSD ≥ 0)`, which trivially passes.
4. The function mints 1 DAI to Alice with no collateral.

**Subsequent Borrow (Still Unsound)**
1. Suppose Alice now has an outstanding 1 DAI borrow, so `getBorrowBalance(Alice, lDAI).borrowIndex != 0`. She then also takes out a 50 USDC borrow on the same chain.
2. Internally
`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(Alice, lETH, 0, 10 ETH)` computes:

- `allBorrowedUSD = USD value of (1 DAI + 50 USDC + 10 ETH)`.
- `totalCollateralUSD = 0` (because she never provided collateral).

`currentBorrow = getBorrowBalance(Alice, lETH)` is (`amount = 0`, `borrowIndex = 0`) since she’s never borrowed ETH. But actually, in this exact scenario, `borrowIndex == 0` again → zero‐check path → she gets 10 ETH for free.

Even if she had borrowed ETH before, the check would be:

```solidity
borrowAmount = (allBorrowedUSD × newETHIndex) / oldETHIndex
require(0 ≥ borrowAmount) → fails unless oldETHIndex is infinite.
```
But since she had no ETH borrow originally, she still hits the “zero” branch.

Hence, on every first borrow of any market, the contract gives out tokens against zero collateral. After that, any next borrow in that same market is protected only by a nonsensical formula that multiplies ALL of Alice’s USD‐denominated debt (DAI, USDC, ETH, etc.) by the ETH borrowIndex ratio and still checks that against total collateral (which she may never have provided).

### Impact

Any address that has never borrowed a particular token can instantly borrow arbitrarily large amounts of that token with zero collateral. This effectively allows draining of the entire market’s liquidity. For example, a fresh account can call `borrow(BigNumber, lToken)` and pull out millions of tokens if the pool has liquidity.

Even if an attacker tries to borrow a second time in the same market, the check still fails to enforce the correct condition (it compares `totalCollateralUSD` against `allBorrowedUSD × (newIndex/oldIndex)` instead of the proper “market‐specific borrow + new borrow must be ≤ collateral in USD”).

The usual invariant is “you must deposit collateral in proportion to the USD value of your clearance loan”—is broken. Any token market is vulnerable to a free‐loan exploit on the very first `borrow(...)` call from an address.

Because of this, protocol liquidity can be entirely drained by iterating over every supported asset and calling `borrow(...)` once for each, with zero collateral required.
