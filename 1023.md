# Hardcoded gas limit may cause Transaction Failures across Different Blockchain Networks



## Description

The `_send()` function in the LayerZero cross-chain messaging implementation contains a hardcoded gas limit of `1,000,000` gas units for the executor option. This static gas allocation fails to account for the varying gas costs and different destination chains may require different amount of gas and also the message itself can cause different amount of gas.

```solidity
function _send(
    uint32 _dstEid,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _borrowIndex,
    uint256 _collateral,
    address _sender,
    address _destlToken,
    address _liquidator,
    address _srcToken,
    ContractType ctype
) internal {
    bytes memory payload =
        abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

    // @audit: Hardcoded gas value of 1,000,000
    bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

    _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
}
```

## Impact
Transactions may fail due to insufficient gas allocation when the message is sent to different blockchain networks with higher gas cost and the operation is also costly with multi-step. Cross-chain transfers may become stuck if execution fails on destination chain if operation is multi-step such as liquidation etc.

## Recommendation
Have some mechanisms to estimate the require gas amount or let user to specify gas
