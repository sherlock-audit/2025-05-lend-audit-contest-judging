# Incorrect `borrowedAmount` in `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function

### Summary

In `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function of `CoreRouter.sol`, incorrect `borrowedAmount` is calculated and used.\
This leads to incorrect comparison between collateral and borrow amount.

### Root Cause

In [`liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L344-L350) function, `borrowedAmount` is calculated with `borrowed`:
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        ...
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
@>          borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

            ...
        }

        return 0;
    }
```
Looking into `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function call in `liquidateBorrowInternal` function, you can notice that `borrowed` is from `liquidateBorrowInternal` function:
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowInternal(
        ...
@>      uint256 borrowed
    ) internal {
        require(
@>          liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(borrowedlToken, borrower, repayAmount, collateral, borrowed) == 0,
            "Borrow not allowed"
        );
        ...
    }
```
And also looking into `liquidateBorrowInternal` function call in `liquidateBorrow` function, you can notice that `borrowed` is calculated with `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function:
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
        external
    {
        ...
        LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
@>          lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);
        liquidateBorrowInternal(
@>          msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }
```

This means that `borrowed` in `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`, is already updated with `lTokenBorrowed.borrowIndex` and `borrowBalance.borrowIndex`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

`borrowedAmount` is increased twice incorrectly and this value is compared with `collateral` .\
This means that when `borrowed` is less than `collateral`, incorrect liquidation could occur.

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Simple use `borrowed` instead of `borrowedAmount`:
```diff
--   require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
++   require(borrowed > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```
