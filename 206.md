# Users can repeatedly claim the same LEND rewards due to lack of reset after claim.

### Summary

The protocol does not reset a user’s accrued LEND rewards to zero after a claim, allowing users to call `claimLend `multiple times and receive the same rewards repeatedly, resulting in draining of LEND rewards of the contract.



### Root Cause

In the `LendStorage `contract, the functions `distributeSupplierLend `and `distributeBorrowerLend `update the `lendAccrued `mapping by adding newly accrued rewards to the existing value. However, after a user claims their LEND rewards (via `claimLend `in `CoreRouter`), the accrued amount in `lendAccrued[user]` is not set to zero. As a result, users can call `claimLend `multiple times and continue to receive the same rewards, since the accrued value persists in storage. There is no mechanism in the claim or distribution logic to reset the accrued amount after a successful transfer.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User and the whole `CoreRouter `contract is eligible for LEND rewards and/or have some LEND balance.

### External Pre-conditions

There is a nonzero accrued LEND balance for the user.

### Attack Path

1. User accrues LEND rewards through supplying or borrowing.
2. User calls `claimLend`(which calls `grantLendInternal `to transfer the rewards) and receives their accrued LEND.
3. Because `lendAccrued[user]` is not zeroed, the user can call `claimLend `again and receive the same rewards.
4. The user repeats this process, draining the contract’s LEND balance.

### Impact

Users can repeatedly claim the same LEND rewards, extracting all LEND tokens from the contract balance and undermine the protocol’s reward system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

After transferring LEND tokens to the user in the claim logic, set `lendAccrued[user] = 0 ` to prevent multiple claims of the same rewards.
