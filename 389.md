# Free Transaction Exploitation via Trapped ETH

### Summary

The overridden fee validation logic will cause unfair value transfer for paying users as subsequent users will exploit trapped ETH in the contract to get free cross-chain transactions without paying any fees.

### Root Cause

In [CrossChainRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L794-L799) the fee validation uses `address(this).balance` instead of `msg.value`, allowing users to bypass payment requirements when the contract has accumulated ETH from previous users.

```solidity
function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual override returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
    if (address(this).balance < _nativeFee) {  // Uses contract balance instead of msg.value
        revert NotEnoughNative(address(this).balance); 
    }
    return _nativeFee;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to have ETH balance from previous users' trapped funds (from the refund issue)
2. User needs to call `borrowCrossChain()` with `msg.value = 0` or insufficient payment
3. Contract balance needs to be at least equal to the LayerZero messaging fee
4. User needs to have valid collateral for the cross-chain borrow operation

### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero messaging fee needs to be less than or equal to the contract's accumulated ETH balance

### Attack Path

1. User A calls `borrowCrossChain()` with 0.1 ETH when LayerZero fee is only 0.02 ETH
2. User A's excess 0.08 ETH gets trapped in the contract due to wrong refund address
3. User B calls `borrowCrossChain()` with `msg.value = 0` (pays no ETH)
4. `_payNative()` validates: `address(this).balance` (0.08 ETH) >= `_nativeFee` (0.02 ETH) âœ…
5. User B's transaction succeeds using User A's trapped funds
6. User B receives full cross-chain borrow service without paying any fees
7. Process can repeat with User C, D, etc. until trapped funds are exhausted

### Impact

Paying users suffer unfair value transfer as they subsidize non-paying users' transactions. Sophisticated users can monitor the contract balance and exploit this to get free cross-chain transactions worth the LayerZero messaging fees (typically $1-50 per transaction depending on the chain and message complexity). This undermines the protocol's fee model and creates an economic incentive for exploitation.

### Mitigation

Fix fee validation to use user payment or Implement proper fee quoting and validation
