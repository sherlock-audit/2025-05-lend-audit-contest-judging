# Different Token Decimals on different chains are not accounted for when borrowing or repaying across chains, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol and users

### Summary

This exploit affects all connections between the Binance Smart Chain (BSC/BNB) and any other Blockchain where the deployed `USDC` contract stores amounts with 6 decimals instead of 18. The protocol plans to deploy to BNB/BSC

When a user borrows an amount of N `USDC` on Chain A (Base, Ethereum Mainnet), where token X has 6 Decimals and supplies their collateral on Chain B (BSC), where `USDC` has 18 Decimals, the user receives $N*10^{12}$ tokens on the target chain. Any attacker can use this exploit to drain the contract of all its `USDC`, leading to a loss of Funds for the protocol. Further, an unsuspecting user might borrow `USDC` on Chain B using collateral supplied on Chain A and receive $N/10^{12}$ `USDC` instead of N `USDC`

### Root Cause

The root cause of this exploit is the different decimals `USDC` has on the chains the protocol wants to deploy to. On BSC/BNB, `USDC` has 18 decimals, while on almost all other chains, `USDC` only has 6 decimals. The difference in decimals is not accounted for in the protocol, as the amount transferred is specified in the message payload sent using LZ and not scaled when transferring between chains.

### Attack Path

User calls `CoreRouter::supply` on BSC with an amount of 1e18 `USDC` e.g., 1 `USDC` Token, to receive the corresponding lToken and supply the required collateral

User calls `CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain` on BSC with an amount of 1e18 `USDC` Tokens 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L154

The message is transferred to the Ethereum Mainnet using `lzSend`. The `payload. _amount` parameter now contains the amount of `USDC` the user wants to borrow (1e18)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L804-L822

`CrossChainRouter::lzReceive` is called on  Ethereum Mainnet in turn calling `_lzReceive` which then calls `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`

`CrossChainRouter::_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` calls `CoreRouter::borrowForCrossChain`, which transfers the amount specified in the payload ($1*10^{18}$ `USDC`) if the collateral is sufficient, which in this case it is

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L195C1-L205C6

The user has now received  $1*10^{12}$ their collateral in `USDC` as `USDC` only uses 6 decimals on Ethereum Mainnet

In the opposite case, a user supplying  one  `USDC`, which on most chains is represented using 6 decimal places as collateral on Mainnet, would only receive the same amount on BSC, where its actual  value is $1^{-12}$ `USDC` instead of one `USDC`


### Impact

High -- loss of funds

The protocol can be drained of all `USDC` funds owned by the protocol's implementation on all chains connected to the Binance Smart Chain

Users receive significantly less `USDC` than expected on the Binance Smart Chain when borrowing across chains

This vulnerability afflicts all functions that send or receive `USDC` across chains 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Since only specific whitelisted Chains and Tokens are allowed, and as far as i am aware this vulnerability only effects `USDC` and only when transferred from or to BSC, a simple check of the `_destEid` parameter would allow up scaling or down scaling the amount based which Chain the tokens are from before encoding the amount in the  payload variable which is passed to `lzSend`
