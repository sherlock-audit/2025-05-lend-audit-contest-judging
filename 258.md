# _send forwards the contracts whole balance to the destination chain

### Summary

_send forwards all of the contract balance as the native gas fee but the excess won't be always returned 

### Root Cause

As per the LayerZero documentation: 

"a quote paid in advance on the source chain by the msg.sender for the equivalent amount of native gas to be used on the destination chain. If the actual cost to execute the message is less than what was set in _options, there is no default way to refund the sender the difference. Application developers need to thoroughly profile and test gas amounts to ensure consumed gas amounts are correct and not excessive."

The refund address specified mostly serves to refund the native fee if the transaction fails, also as per LZ's documentation:

"The refund address in case the send call reverts."

Instead of forwarding the whole contract balance to every call (which will consume different amount depending on the destination chain), quote the needed gas amount and include that one with a small buffer on top.

    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

        _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }

### Internal Pre-conditions

Taking in consideration the varying costs of gas, possible accumulation of native tokens in the contract, different destination endpoints will cost differently in terms of gas, and a lot of other variables - forwarding the whole balance would cause unintended excess losses.

### External Pre-conditions

N/a

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Without first quoting to see how much native fee will the transaction/payload consume, we're risking two things:

Constantly over-sending native gas which won't get refunded, thus causing excess transaction cost for the protocol
The transaction failing due to sending less than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of forwarding the whole balance of the contract, implement and use a quote() function to estimate how much native gas needs to be forwarded in accordance with the message settings that we've included as the options, and forward the amount specified, or just above it.
