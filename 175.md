# Double Interest Calculation Bug in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal Function

## Summary
A double interest calculation in the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function will cause an incorrect shortfall assessment for borrowers, putting them at risk of premature liquidation as liquidators can liquidate positions that should still be sufficiently collateralized.

## Root cause
In `CoreRouter.sol` the borrowedAmount calculation applies interest scaling twice. The `borrowed` parameter (from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`) already includes accrued interest, but the function applies the interest scaling factor again, resulting in an inflated debt value.

### Internal Pre-conditions
N/A
### External Pre-conditions
None significant.

### Attack Path
1. A liquidator identifies a borrower whose position appears undercollateralized due to this bug
2. The liquidator calls `liquidateBorrow()` which triggers `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()`
3. Inside `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()`, the borrowedAmount is incorrectly calculated by double-applying interest:
   ```solidity
   borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
   ```
4. The function incorrectly determines that `borrowedAmount > collateral`, allowing the liquidation to proceed
5. The liquidator seizes the borrower's collateral at a discount despite the borrower's position being properly collateralized

### Impact
Borrowers suffer incorrect liquidations of properly collateralized positions. Since liquidations typically involve a discount (liquidation incentive), this results in borrowers losing a portion of their collateral value that should have been protected. The magnitude of loss depends on:
1. The liquidation incentive percentage (typically 5-10%)
2. The size of the position being liquidated
3. The difference between current borrow index and user's last borrow index
### POC
Similar to #8 
### Mitigation
The fix should remove the double interest calculation by modifying the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function:

```solidity
// INCORRECT (current implementation)
borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

// CORRECT (fixed implementation)
borrowedAmount = borrowed; // The 'borrowed' parameter from getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral already includes accrued interest
```
