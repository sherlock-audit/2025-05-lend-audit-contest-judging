# Double Counting Interest in Liquidation Shortfall Check

### Title
Double Counting Interest in Liquidation Shortfall Check

### Severity
High

### Impact 
The shortfall calculation for liquidation becomes overly stringent because the borrower’s debt is scaled by the borrow‐index twice. As a result, a borrower who is actually under‐collateralized may appear solvent, preventing legitimate liquidations. Conversely, a marginal borrower could be flagged under‐collateralized even when fully healthy, leading to wrongful liquidation attempts.

## Likelihood
Moderate
•	Any liquidation on a market where the borrower has nonzero debt invokes this logic.
•	Occurs whenever liquidateBorrow is called for a borrower with existing interest owed.

### Type


### Target
Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol

## Description
In `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow`, the code first calls:
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);
```

Within `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, the helper `borrowWithInterest` (or borrowWithInterestSame) already returns the borrower’s outstanding debt including accrued interest by computing:
```solidity
currentBorrow = (storedPrincipal × currentBorrowIndex) ÷ storedBorrowIndex;
```

Thus, the returned borrowed value equals “principal × (currentIndex ÷ storedIndex).”
Immediately afterward, `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` recomputes:
```solidity
borrowedAmount =
    (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) 
      / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
```
Because borrowed already includes one factor of (currentIndex ÷ storedIndex), multiplying it again by (currentIndex ÷ storedIndex) yields “principal × (currentIndex ÷ storedIndex)²,” effectively counting accrued interest twice. This inflated borrowedAmount makes the protocol believe the borrower owes more than they actually do, causing require(borrowedAmount > collateral) to fail for many borrowers who are in fact under‐collateralized or allowing liquidation of healthy accounts.



## Exploit Scenario


## Recommendations
Remove the redundant index scaling so that debt is only converted “principal → up-to-date debt” exactly once. For example, in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal replace:
```solidity
// Current (incorrect): borrowed already has interest applied
borrowedAmount =
    (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```
with:
```solidity
// Correct: use 'borrowed' directly, since it already equals principal × (currentIndex ÷ storedIndex)
borrowedAmount = borrowed;
```

Alternatively, modify `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` so that it returns purely the raw principal (no index applied), and then in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal perform exactly one index‐scale
