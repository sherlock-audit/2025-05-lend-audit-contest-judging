# Missing forceResumeReceive() in CrossChainRouter Leading to DoS

### Summary

The CrossChainRouter contract lacks the forceResumeReceive function, which is essential for unblocking stuck LayerZero messages. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, halting cross-chain operations like borrowing or liquidation and locking user funds.

### Root Cause

The choice to omit the ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig interface implementation, specifically forceResumeReceive, in CrossChainRouter is a mistake as it prevents manual recovery of stuck cross-chain messages, a critical feature for LayerZero integration.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Deployer needs to deploy CrossChainRouter without implementing forceResumeReceive.
2. Protocol needs to process a cross-chain message (e.g., borrow request) that fails or gets stuck due to internal logic errors.

### External Pre-conditions

LayerZeroâ€™s messaging layer needs to experience a failure or delay, causing messages to remain undelivered.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker triggers a message failure e.g by sending wrong data, sending low gaslimit or any other failure.
2. This causes a cross-chain message to get stuck, blocking the message queue in CrossChainRouter.
3. Without forceResumeReceive, the protocol cannot unblock the queue, halting all cross-chain operations.

### Impact

The users cannot execute cross-chain borrows, repayments, or liquidations, locking their funds indefinitely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig interface in CrossChainRouter, including forceResumeReceive, to enable manual unblocking of the message queue:
```solidity

function forceResumeReceive(uint16 srcChainId, bytes calldata srcAddress) external override {
    // Logic to resume message processing
    lzEndpoint.forceResumeReceive(srcChainId, srcAddress);
}
```
