# Users will lose ETH sent to CoreRouter as there is no withdrawal mechanism

### Summary

The lack of a withdrawal function in CoreRouter will cause a permanent loss of ETH for users as any ETH sent to the contract via the receive() function will be permanently locked.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol` the [receive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L46) function accepts ETH but there is no corresponding withdrawal mechanism, unlike `CrossChainRouter.sol` which has a `withdrawEth()` function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. CoreRouter contract must be deployed
2. receive() function must be able to accept ETH

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User accidentally sends ETH to CoreRouter contract via receive() function
2. ETH becomes permanently locked in the contract as there is no withdrawal mechanism
3. Even the contract owner cannot recover the funds

### Impact

Users suffer a permanent loss of any ETH sent to the contract. The ETH becomes permanently locked with no way to recover it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `withdrawEth()` function similar to `CrossChainRouter`
