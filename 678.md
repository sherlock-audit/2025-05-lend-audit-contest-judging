# Lack of minimum position size can lead to bad debt for the protocol

### Summary

There is no minimum supply amount enforced so attackers can create many small positions so it becomes financially disincentivizing to liquidate them and bad debt occurs

### Root Cause

Supplying and borrowing lack any minimum collateral checks so bad debt can occur with positions that are not profitable to liquidate

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attackers supply small amounts of collateral and borrow against them
2. With time their positions become underwater but the liquidation incentive is too small so they are not getting liquidated
Bad debt keeps compounding so the protocol and the users take losses

### Impact

Bad debt for the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a minimum collateral amount
