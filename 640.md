# Incorrect Use of the `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` Function

### Summary
In the current implementation, cross-chain liquidation begins on Chain B. If the seize operation succeeds on Chain A (the source chain), the underlying tokens are transferred to the liquidator, and repayment is executed on Chain B (the destination chain). However, when liquidation begins on Chain B, the `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` function is incorrectly utilized.

### Root Cause
The root cause is that when starting cross-chain liquidation, there is an incorrect use of the `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` function.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### PoC
The following code illustrates how the `borrowWithInterest` function calculates the total borrow using the collateral of the current chain:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504
```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
        uint256 borrowedAmount;

        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
        if (borrows.length > 0) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
                if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
                // Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
                if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
                    borrowedAmount +=
                        (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
                }
            }
        }
        return borrowedAmount;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L582
```solidity
    function getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(address borrower, address lToken, bool isSameChain)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // Get the current borrow balance including interest
        uint256 currentBorrow = 0;

        // Calculate same-chain borrows with interest
582:    currentBorrow += isSameChain ? borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lToken) : borrowWithInterest(borrower, lToken);

        // Get close factor from lendtroller (typically 0.5 or 50%)
        uint256 closeFactorMantissa = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa();

        // Calculate max repay amount (currentBorrow * closeFactor)
        uint256 maxRepay = (currentBorrow * closeFactorMantissa) / 1e18;

        return maxRepay;
    }
```
As can be seen, the `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` function calculates the maximum repayment amount based on the current chain's collateral. In other words, this function is only applicable for same-chain liquidation.

The `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function calls `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` incorrectly during cross-chain liquidation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L227
```solidity
    function _validateAndPrepareLiquidation(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private view {
        ...
        // Validate liquidation amount against close factor
        uint256 maxLiquidationAmount = lendStorage.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(
            params.borrower,
            params.borrowedlToken,
            false // cross-chain liquidation
        );
        require(params.repayAmount <= maxLiquidationAmount, "Exceeds max liquidation");
    }
```
As a result, even if a user is liquidatable, they could not be liquidated due to this incorrect use of the function.

Consider the following scenario:
Collateral factor = 0.85, closeFactorMantissa = 0.5
1. Alice has 1000 USDT on Chain A.
2. Alice performs a same-chain borrow on Chain B for 800 USDC.
3. Alice has no assets on Chain B, so there is no borrowing based on Chain B's assets.
4. Over time, her debt increases to 900 USDC due to interest.
5. Bob start a cross-chain liquidation of Alice on chainB.
At this time, the `borrowWithInterest` returns zero and `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` also returns zero.
As a result, Alice cannot be liquidated.

### Impact
Even if there is under-water user, they could not be liquidated, resulting in a loss for the protocol.
