# The `CoreRouter` contract has `receive` function, but doesn't have `withdraw`

## Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract has `receive` function that allows the users to send ETH to the contract, but the received amount of funds is locked in the contract, because there is no `withdraw` function.

## Root Cause

The [`CoreRouter::receive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L46) function allows the user to send native currency to the contract, but there is no mechanism to withdraw these funds:

```solidity

receive() external payable {}

```

## Impact

The users can mistakenly send ETH to the contract. Locked funds in the `CoreRouter` contract.

## Mitigation

Add a `withdraw` function like this one in the `CrossChainRouter` contract.
