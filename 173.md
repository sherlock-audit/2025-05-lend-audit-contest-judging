# Lack of `msg.value` check enables griefing

### Summary

`CrossChainRouter.sol#borrowCrossChain()` does not check if `msg.sender` sends a sufficient `msg.value` to cover the gas costs for the LayerZero message.

### Root Cause

`CrossChainRouter.sol#borrowCrossChain()` does not check if `msg.sender` sends a sufficient `msg.value` to cover the gas costs for the LayerZero message.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol holds a non-zero ETH balance.

2. The user is not required to supply `msg.value`, or the supplied amount is not enforced to cover gas for the LayerZero message.

The `borrowCrossChain()` call successfully passes all checks and triggers `_send()` without requiring economic commitment from the user.

The destination chain borrow execution reverts, either due to invalid collateral, malicious manipulation, or any condition that fails post-message dispatch.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `borrowCrossChain()` with no ETH (msg.value == 0).

2. The function proceeds and sends a LayerZero message, funded by the protocol’s own ETH.

3. On the destination chain, the borrow fails (`e.g., collateral insufficient`), and the entire cross-chain operation reverts.

4. Since the malicious user spent no ETH, they can repeat this infinitely, draining the protocol’s ETH.

### Impact

A malicious user can drain the entire ETH balance held by the protocol for cross-chain messaging.
