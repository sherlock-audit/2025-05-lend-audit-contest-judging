# Incorrect Liquidation Validation Adds to User’s Debt, Leading to Unfair Liquidations

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidation, the source chain mistakenly adds the liquidation payload.amount to the user’s debt when validating if liquidation is allowed. This artificially increases the user's borrow amount and can trigger liquidation even if the user’s account is still healthy.

### Root Cause

To start cross chain liqudation users send message from destination to source chain with payload amounts. 

When message received in the source chain `_checkLiquidationValid` function is called to check if it is a  valid liquidation. `_checkLiquidationValid` uses getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral with `payload.amount`. Internally, this function adds payload.amount to the user’s borrow balance when computing liquidity, causing a false debt increase. since 
` payload.amount` is the ltokens that would be removed from user this value sholnt be added to total user dept.

```solidity
   function _executeLiquidationCore(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private {
        // Calculate seize tokens
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(params.borrowedAsset);

        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
            .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, params.lTokenToSeize, params.repayAmount);

        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Seize calculation failed");

        // Send message to Chain A to execute the seize
        _send(
            params.srcEid,
            seizeTokens,
            params.storedBorrowIndex,
            0,
            params.borrower,
            lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to Chain A version before sending
            msg.sender,
            params.borrowedAsset,
            ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
        );
    }

    function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );
        return borrowed > collateral;
    }

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user has cross-chain collateral and borrow positions.
The user is not undercollateralized in reality.
A liquidator triggers liquidation on the destination chain.



### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator initiates a liquidation on the destination chain.
2. The _send function dispatches a CrossChainLiquidationExecute message to the source chain.
3. On the source chain, _checkLiquidationValid is called with payload.amount 
4. getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral incorrectly adds this amount to the user's borrow.
5. This makes the system believe the user is undercollateralized.
6. Liquidation proceeds, even though the user is actually healthy.

### Impact

Healthy users may be unfairly liquidated.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that liquidation checks do not add the amount to the user’s borrow balance
