# Silent Failure Due to Unchecked ERC20 `transfer` Return Values

### Summary

The protocol directly uses `IERC20.transfer()` for transferring whitelisted underlying tokens (such as USDC, WBTC, WETH, and USDT) to users in `redeem`, `borrow`, and `borrowForCrossChain` functions. This approach does not check the boolean return value of `transfer()`. For tokens like **USDT**, whose `transfer()` function might not return a boolean and can fail without reverting, this leads to a critical silent failure where tokens are not transferred, but the protocol's state is incorrectly updated. This results in user funds being inaccessible or the protocol holding a false accounting of its token balances.

The ERC20 token standard (EIP-20) specifies that `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions should return a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the operation. The EIP-20 specification explicitly states: "Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that false is never returned!"

The issue in this protocol arises because the affected functions directly call `IERC20(_token).transfer()` without verifying the boolean return value. While some whitelisted tokens like USDC, WBTC, and WETH typically return `true` on success and revert on critical failures, certain tokens, most notably **older or specific versions of USDT**, exhibit non-standard behavior. Their `transfer()` function might **not return a boolean value at all**. In such specific scenarios, if the return value is not explicitly handled or checked, the call can fail **silently without reverting the transaction**, leading to a state inconsistency.

**Affected Code Blocks:**

* **`redeem` function:**
    ```solidity
    // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
    ```
* **`borrow` function:**
    ```solidity
    // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
    IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    ```
* **`borrowForCrossChain` function:**
    ```solidity
    IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    ```


### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

* The specific ERC20 token being transferred (e.g., certain versions of USDT) has a `transfer()` function that, upon failure, behaves in a non-standard way:
    * It returns `false` (in compliance with EIP-20's success indicator, but this `false` is not acted upon).
    * OR it does not return a boolean value at all, and the current Solidity/EVM environment allows the call to fail silently without reverting the entire transaction.
* The underlying token transfer operation itself would have failed if its success were properly checked.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

This unchecked return value leads directly to **Funds Stuck / Inconsistent State (Silent Failure)**:

* For tokens like **USDT**, where the `transfer()` function may not return a boolean value but can still fail silently (without reverting), the protocol will not detect the failed transfer due to the absence of a return value check.
* The transaction will then proceed to completion, and the protocol's internal state (e.g., updated `totalInvestment` or `borrowBalance` records) will incorrectly reflect a successful token transfer, even though the recipient never actually received the tokens.
* This results in user funds becoming irretrievable from the protocol's contract, or a critical discrepancy between the user's expected token holdings and their actual received tokens. This type of silent failure is particularly dangerous as it can go unnoticed, leading to accumulating bad debt or user dissatisfaction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is strongly recommended to use a robust ERC20 wrapper library, such as OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20`, for all ERC20 interactions. The `SafeERC20` library provides wrappers like `safeTransfer()` and `safeTransferFrom()` that:
* Automatically handle the boolean return value check for standard-compliant tokens.
* Safely interact with non-standard tokens (like older USDT versions) by using low-level calls that explicitly account for scenarios where no return value is present, ensuring that transactions revert in case of failure, preventing silent failures.

**Recommended Change Example:**

Instead of:
`IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);`

Use:
`IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);`

This approach should be applied to all instances of `IERC20(_token).transfer()` within the protocol to ensure consistent, secure, and resilient token handling, especially for tokens like USDT.
