# Potential Underflow in `repayBorrow`

### Summary

In the [repayBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L212) and [repayCrossChainLiquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L216) functions—which both internally call [repayBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459)—there is no validation to prevent _amount from exceeding the user's actual borrowed amount.

The ternary check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L480) caps the repayment amount to the borrowed amount only if the input _amount is type(uint256).max. Otherwise, it proceeds with the full input _amount unconditionally.

Later in the function, there's a conditional to check if the repayment fully covers the borrowed amount:

```solidity

if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) { ... } else { ... }
```
If true, the borrow state is cleared. But if _amount is less than or greater than the actual debt, the else branch is triggered.

If _amount < borrowedAmount: this behaves as expected — a partial repayment.

If _amount > borrowedAmount: the subtraction borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal underflows, 
Note in [CrossChainRouter.repayCrossChainBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L384) the require statement to enforce repayment does not exceed the borrowAmount is checked, but not done on the `CoreRouter.repayBorrowInternal`

The resulting operation reverts and causes DOS for users repaying

### Root Cause

In [repayBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L459) an edge case scenario where a user repays with an `repayAmountFinal > borrowedAmount` is not accounted for which will result in underflow

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

1. User borrows token A
2. decides to repay with an amount slightly greater than initial borrow.
3. Underflow occurs and DOS's the user from performing the transaction

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Underflow occurs for users, DOS and revert

### PoC

1. Alice borrows 2ETH while supplying collateral say 10000 DAI (collaterization ratio of 80%).
2. time passed and Alice decides to repay debt and get her collateral back.
3. Alice pays back here 2.1 ETH or a number slightly above 2 ETH making the (repaymentAmountFinal > borrowedAmount)
4. hence since the else branch gets executed for `updateBorrowBalance` making the new updated  to be `borrowedAmount -repaymentAmountFinal`
5. underflows occurs, DOS the transaction 

### Mitigation

consider capping the repayment

```solidity
repayAmountFinal = _amount > borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : _amount;
  ```
