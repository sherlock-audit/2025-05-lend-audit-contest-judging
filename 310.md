# ChainB will refund tokens to liquidator without ever receiving them, causing protocol fund loss

#### **Summary**

A missing repayment step in the initial liquidation process will cause an invalid refund on Chain B. Specifically, in the `_handleLiquidationFailure()` function, the protocol refunds tokens to the liquidator despite never actually receiving those tokens in the first place. This causes a direct and unbacked outflow of tokens from the protocol’s treasury, leading to potential fund loss.

#### **Root Cause**

In `CrossChainRouter.sol: 482 _handleLiquidationFailure()` on Chain B:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-sylvarithos/blob/551944cd87d138620b89c11674a92f1dcbe0efbe/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L482
```solidity
function _handleLiquidationFailure(LZPayload memory payload) private {
    address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

    // Refund the liquidator
482    IERC20(underlying).safeTransfer(payload.liquidator, payload.amount);

    emit LiquidationFailure(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, payload.sender, underlying);
}
```

Tokens are refunded to the liquidator under the assumption that they were initially transferred in during the liquidation call. However, in `liquidateCrossChain()` and its downstream logic (`_executeLiquidationCore()`), no actual token transfer occurs from the liquidator. The liquidation request is only a cross-chain message, and the liquidator never sends any tokens. 
As a result, the protocol is refunding tokens it never received.

#### **Internal Pre-conditions**

1. Liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain()` on Chain B.
2. Protocol sends a cross-chain liquidation execution message to Chain A, including a `repayAmount`.
3. Chain A performs validation and finds liquidation invalid (e.g., not undercollateralized).
4. Chain A returns a `LiquidationFailure` message back to Chain B.

#### **External Pre-conditions**

None — no dependencies on oracles or third-party protocols.


#### **Attack Path**

1. Attacker triggers `liquidateCrossChain()` with a `repayAmount` of X tokens.
2. No actual transfer is made from the attacker to the protocol.
3. Chain A rejects the liquidation via validation.
4. Chain B calls `_handleLiquidationFailure()` and blindly sends X tokens to attacker.
5. Attacker receives funds without any input.

#### **Impact**

- **The protocol loses tokens directly.**
- **The attacker gains the full `repayAmount` without depositing anything.**
- If this is repeatable, the protocol could be drained via spoofed liquidation attempts.

#### **Mitigation**

- Require actual token transfer from the liquidator before initiating `liquidateCrossChain()`.
    - Hold funds in escrow until validation returns success or failure.
- If validation fails, return escrowed funds.
- Only call `safeTransfer` if the protocol actually holds the funds on behalf of the liquidator.
