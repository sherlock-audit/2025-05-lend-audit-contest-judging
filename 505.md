# Stale Exchange Rate Used for `redeem` token calculation

### Summary
The [`CoreRouter::redeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L115-L124) function caches the exchange rate before calling the internal redeem logic that updates the exchange rate by accruing interest. This causes a mismatch between the cached (stale) exchange rate used for calculating the expected underlying tokens and the actual updated exchange rate applied internally.

### Root cause
The function stores `exchangeRateBefore = exchangeRateStored()` before calling the internal redeem method, which itself calls `accrueInterest()` and updates the exchange rate. The external calculation for the expected underlying tokens uses the cached `exchangeRateBefore`, which may be outdated relative to the newly accrued interest.
```javascript
//CoreRouter.sol

  function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored(); <@ //stale price 
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18; <@ // _amount * stale price 
    
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed"); <@ //updated price

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying); <@ //transferred incorrect price

        ...
  }
```

### Attack Path
- User calls redeem(_amount, _lToken) with a specific amount of lTokens.

- The function stores the stale exchange rate in exchangeRateBefore:
```javascript
 uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
```

- Internal redeem(_amount) executes, triggering `accrueInterest()` that increases the exchange rate.

- Internal redeem calculates underlying tokens based on the updated exchange rate.

- The external function calculates expected underlying tokens to send using the stale cached rate as:
```javascript
 uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
```
- User receives tokens based on `expectedUnderlying` (stale rate), but the actual redeemed amount may be higher or lower due to the updated rate internally used.

This causes discrepancies between transferred tokens and user balances updated based on stale values.

**Example with Real Values:**

- exchangeRateBefore = 1e18 (representing 1.0)

- _amount = 100e18 lTokens (100 lTokens with 18 decimals)

- Internal `accrueInterest()` updates exchange rate to 1.05e18 (5% interest accrued)

- Internal redeem calculates underlying tokens:
```javascript
actualUnderlying = 100 * 1.05e18 / 1e18 = 105Â tokens
```

- External function calculates expected underlying tokens as:
```javascript
expectedUnderlying = 100 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 100 tokens
```

- User receives only 100 tokens transferred by the external function, while the internal accounting assumed 105 tokens.

- This mismatch leads to inconsistent balances and potential token loss or user disadvantage.


### Impact
Contract internal accounting of total investment becomes inconsistent with actual tokens transferred.



### Recommendation
1. Consider calling `accrueInterest()` before calling `exchangeRateStored()` 
2. Or use `exchangeRateCurrent()`  instead of `exchangeRateStored()` since `exchangeRateCurrent()` internally calls `accrueInterest()`.
