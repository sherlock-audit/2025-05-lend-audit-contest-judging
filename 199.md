# Empty Market Attack Vulnerability in `CoreRouter` Contract Due to No Minimum Deposit and Precision Loss During `lToken` redemption

### Summary

The `CoreRouter` contract is vulnerable to an **empty market attack**, similar to the Onyx and Hundred Finance Protocol exploit, where an attacker can manipulate the exchange rate of an empty or low-liquidity market by depositing a small amount of tokens, inflating the cash by donating `lToken` to the contract minting a minimal number of `lTokens` , then redeeming `lTokens` to withdraw a disproportionate amount of underlying tokens due to precision loss in the `ExponentialNoError.div_` function Inherited by `CoreContract`. The absence of a minimum deposit amount and precision loss in redemption calculations allow attackers to exploit markets with zero or low `totalSupply`.


### Root Cause

1) In `CoreRouter.sol` [Line 61 - 92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61-#L92) for supply does not enforce a minimum deposit amount (any amount above 0).  

2) In `CoreRouter.sol` [Line 121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L121) for redeem, the CoreRouter contract calls redeem function on the `Ltoken` Contract which calls `redeemFresh` and does an integer division using `div_`  used in redemption calculations leading to precision loss when a `ltoken` is redeemed

### Internal Pre-conditions

An attacker identifies an empty market where the totalSupply is zero

The attacker has a supplies a small amount of the underlying token and is minted few `lToken` 

He then manipulates the exchange rate since it hasn`t been set (defaults to 1e18) and redeems an lToken e.g 3.9999, which rounds down to 3 and manipulates exchange rate, and can then redeem more collateral for what he deposited




### External Pre-conditions

Empty Market, where the totalSupply is 0

### Attack Path

A detailed attack is shown here in a blog: https://mixbytes.io/blog/aave-and-compound-forking-empty-pool-attacks
Below is just a quick example scenario

The attacker identifies an lToken market with totalSupply = 0.

The attacker calls supply(_amount = 3, _token) to deposit 3 tokens into the empty market.

The supply function retrieves the exchange rate via LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored(). With totalSupply = 0, the deposit increases totalCash, inflating the exchange rate (e.g., to 1e18 or a default high value).

The supply function calculates mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore using div_ from ExponentialNoError.sol. Due to the high exchange rate and integer division, mintTokens is small (e.g., 1 lToken) because of precision loss.

The attacker calls redeem(_amount = 2.99999, _lToken) to redeem the 2.9999 lTokens

The redeem function calculates expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18 using div_. Precision loss in div_ may result in expectedUnderlying being rounded down, allowing the attacker to withdraw the entire totalCash
The attacker receives more underlying tokens than deposited, draining the market.



### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of the entire totalCash in the targeted empty market, which could include the attackerâ€™s deposit plus any existing funds. The attacker gains the excess underlying tokens withdrawn, potentially profiting significantly if the market contains additional liquidity.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Avoid empty markets from existing:  This can be addressed by depositing a minimum amount into a new pool immediately after deployment (within the deployment transaction). If this is done in separate transactions, a malicious user could insert themselves between the transactions and drain the entire protocol.
- Enforce a Minimum Deposit Amount:
