# Cross-chain repayment impossible due to incorrect chain ID validation in `borrowWithInterest()`

### Summary

`borrowWithInterest()` incorrectly requires both the source and destination chain IDs to match the current chain ID for cross-chain collateral borrows. This condition can never be true, causing the function to return zero borrowed amount. As a result, cross-chain repayments always fail due to the “Borrowed amount is 0” check, making it impossible to repay cross-chain debt.

### Root Cause

`borrowWithInterest()` uses a flawed condition requiring both srcEid and destEid to equal the current chain ID for cross-chain collateral borrows. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L497). Since cross-chain borrows have different source and destination chain IDs, this condition never holds, causing the function to incorrectly report zero `borrowedAmount` and block repayments.
