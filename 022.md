# cross-chain liquidators can steal funds without actually repaying debt

### Summary

During cross-chain liquidation, a vulnerability exists due to the absence of upfront token escrow from the liquidator. Currently, liquidation starts on chain B (where the debt exists), and after validations, `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message is sent to chain A (where the collateral resides). Chain A then seizes the collateral and transfers it to the liquidator. Only afterward does chain B attempt to pull the repay amount from the liquidator to repay the borrow. This opens up an attack vector where the liquidator can receive collateral without repaying any debt if they fail to approve or lack sufficient tokens during the final repayment step.

Currently the `_handleLiquidationFailure` function on Chain B attempts to refund the repay tokens to the liquidator in case the liquidation process fails. This logic assumes that the repay tokens were previously escrowed from the liquidator. However, in reality, no such escrow mechanism is implemented, the tokens are never pulled or held in custody before the liquidation process begins.

### Root Cause

The protocol does not escrow the repay tokens from the liquidator at the beginning of the cross-chain liquidation. Instead, it allows the collateral to be transferred first and then attempts to collect the repay amount, which can fail.

The current flow is:

1. Liquidation initiated on Chain B.
2. Collateral seized and transferred to liquidator on Chain A.
3. Repayment attempted on Chain B.

But it should be:

1. Repay tokens collected and escrowed from the liquidator on Chain B.
2. Liquidation proceeds with collateral seizure on Chain A.
3. Repayment is executed using escrowed tokens, or refunded if liquidation fails.

The root issue is that the `repayAmount` is not secured before the seized collateral is released, allowing a malicious liquidator to avoid repayment and escape with seized collateral.



### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice identifies a borrow position on chain B that is eligible for liquidation and calls `liquidateCrossChain()` function.
2. Chain B’s `CrossChainRouter` validates the liquidation conditions and sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to Chain A.
3. Chain A validates the liquidation again (based on up-to-date liquidity data), seizes the user’s collateral, and transfers it to the liquidator.
4. Chain A sends a `LiquidationSuccess` message back to Chain B.
5. Chain B attempts to pull the repay tokens from the liquidator using `transferFrom` to repay the user’s debt.
6. If the liquidator didn’t approve the `CrossChainRouter` on Chain B or lacks the repay amount, this step fails.
7. As a result, the liquidator keeps the seized collateral, and the user’s debt remains, creating permanent bad debt in the protocol.

### Impact

An malicious liquidator can seize collateral without repaying the borrow, creating bad debt and causing permanent loss to the protocol.

### PoC

*No response*

### Mitigation

The protocol should escrow (lock) the repay tokens from the liquidator at that time of initiating the liquidation process. The liquidation steps should be:

1. Pull and escrow repay tokens from the liquidator on Chain B at the time of initiating liquidation.
2. Perform liquidation and transfer collateral to the liquidator on Chain A.
3. Upon confirmation, use escrowed tokens to repay the debt. If the liquidation fails on chain A, refund the escrowed tokens back to the liquidator.

This ensures the liquidator cannot escape with seized collateral without actually repaying the debt.
