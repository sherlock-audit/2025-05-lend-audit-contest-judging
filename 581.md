# Incorrect borrow amount calculation will prevent users from borrowing the max borrowable amount

### Summary

In the `borrow` function of the `CoreRouter` contract, the calculation of the user's total borrow amount incorrectly applies interest adjustment to both the existing and new borrows. This causes the `borrowAmount` to be artificially inflated, preventing users from borrowing the maximum amount allowed by the collateral factor. 
The function calculates a user's borrowing capacity by calling `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` which calculates and returns two values:
- `borrowed`: The total value borrowed by the user in USD, which already includes existing borrows and the new borrow amount (_amount)
- `collateral`: The total collateral value in USD
The borrowed amount is then adjusted again by applying the interest rate factor to the entire value
```solidity
borrowAmount = borrowed * currentBorrowIndex / currentBorrow.borrowIndex
```
This adjusted value is then compared against the user's collateral. The problem is that the interest calculation is incorrectly applied to the entire borrowed amount, including the new borrow, when it should only be applied to the existing borrow amount 

### Root Cause

In [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157) the function applies the interest rate of user's already borrowed amount to the total borrows including the hypothetical borrowed amount, instead of to just the actual borrowed amount. This inflates the calculated borrowed amount.

### Attack Path

Consider a user with:

- Collateral: 100 USDC
- Collateral factor: 0.75 (75%)
- Existing borrow: 50 USDC
- Current borrow index: 1.1
- User's stored borrow index: 1.0 (meaning interest has accrued by 10%)

The user should be able to borrow up to 75 USDC total, meaning they have 20 USDC of borrowing capacity remaining(i.e 75 - (50 * 1.1))

With the current implementation:

`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calculates:
- borrowed = 50 * 1.1 + 20 = 75 (existing borrow with interest + new borrow)
- collateral = 100 * 0.75 = 75 (collateral * collateral factor)

The borrow check then calculates:
- `borrowAmount` = 75 * 1.1 / 1.0 = 82.5

Since collateral (75) < borrowAmount (82.5), the transaction reverts with "Insufficient collateral" when it should pass

### Impact

Users cannot borrow up to the full amount allowed by the collateral factor, as the calculation artificially inflates their borrow position.

### PoC

NIL

### Mitigation

The calculation should be changed to apply the interest adjustment only to the existing borrow amount, not to the entire amount including new borrows
