# Flawed Token Minting Calculation in `supply` Function


## Finding description and impact

The `supply` function contains a critical flaw in its lToken minting calculation, using a pre-minting exchange rate instead of measuring the actual token balance difference after minting occurs.

```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
...
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

## code snippet:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61-L92

### Root cause

The implementation incorrectly assumes the exchange rate remains constant throughout the minting process and uses pre-calculated estimations rather than actual results. This approach fails to account for:

* Precision loss and rounding effects during the minting operation
* Dynamic exchange rate fluctuations caused by concurrent protocol interactions  
* Additional fees or adjustments that may occur during token minting
* Actual implementation details of the underlying mint function

### Impact

* Inaccurate token quantity calculations leading to accounting discrepancies
* Erroneous `totalInvestment` tracking affecting protocol state
* Downstream functions receiving incorrect `mintTokens` values
* Potential exploitation of calculation mismatches for unfair advantage
* Users experiencing unexpected reward distributions or risk assessment errors

## mitigation

Implement direct balance measurement to capture the exact number of minted tokens:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this));
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 mintTokens = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```

This solution eliminates estimation errors by measuring the actual balance change, ensuring accurate token accounting regardless of exchange rate fluctuations or minting complexities.
