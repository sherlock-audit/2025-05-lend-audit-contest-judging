# Attackers Will Drain Collateral Reserves Through Faulty Liquidations

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the cross-chain liquidation process where liquidators can receive seized collateral without successfully repaying the borrower's debt. This flaw allows malicious actors to profit by intentionally triggering failing liquidations, resulting in protocol losses and system instability.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from:

1. Non-atomic execution between chains

2. Improper state sequencing where collateral is transferred before debt repayment confirmation

3. Lack of rollback mechanisms for failed cross-chain operations

In the liquidation flow user initiate liquidation on borrow chain which send a message to collateral chain toseize the collateral  and send back a message on borrow chain to initiate repayment. In the repayment process if the liquidator don't have enough token to repay the repayement will revert on borrow chain while liquidator already receive collateral on collateral chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Cross-chain liquidation is initiated on the borrow chain (Chain B)

2. Collateral chain (Chain A) processes seizure before repayment verification





### External Pre-conditions

1. Liquidator can trigger transactions without upfront capital commitment

### Attack Path

1. attacker triger liquidation without enough borrow token balance on chain B
2. chain B send message to chain A to send collateral to attacker
3. chain A send message to chain B to process repayement
4. protocole on chain B try to pull fund from liquidator wich doesn't have enough balance
5. repayment failed without sending a message to chain A to undo state change

### Impact

Direct loss of collateral assets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require on-chain proof of successful debt repayment before releasing collateral
