### Title: Lendtroller::_supportMarket doesn't block duplicate markets properly

Description:

Here’s the function:
```solidity
function _supportMarket(LToken lToken) external returns (uint256) {
    if (msg.sender != admin) {
        return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.SUPPORT_MARKET_OWNER_CHECK);
    }

    if (markets[address(lToken)].isListed) {
        return fail(Error.MARKET_ALREADY_LISTED, FailureInfo.SUPPORT_MARKET_EXISTS);
    }

    lToken.isLToken(); // Sanity check

    Market storage newMarket = markets[address(lToken)];
    newMarket.isListed = true;
    newMarket.isLended = false;
    newMarket.collateralFactorMantissa = 0;

    _addMarketInternal(address(lToken));
    _initializeMarket(address(lToken));

    emit MarketListed(lToken);

    return uint256(Error.NO_ERROR);
}
```

This function is supposed to make sure a market can’t be listed more than once. It checks this:

```solidity
if (markets[address(lToken)].isListed) { ... }
```

But that’s not good enough. It sets isListed = true before calling _addMarketInternal, and inside that function it loops through all markets to prevent duplicates — which is too late and not safe if storage is ever desynced (e.g. proxy bug or upgrade mismatch). The check is slow and not scalable either.


Impact:

If the market is somehow added twice (via bug, race, or proxy trick), the same lToken might show up multiple times in allMarkets, which messes up reward calculations, loops, or even causes OOG errors on mass operations. Can also create reward leaks.

PoC:

1. Admin calls _supportMarket() for a valid lToken — works fine.


2. Due to a proxy or state bug, markets[address(lToken)].isListed is false again.


3. Admin calls _supportMarket() again — now market gets added a second time to allMarkets.


4. Now there are duplicate entries in allMarkets.


5. Any logic that loops over allMarkets (like reward distribution) can overpay or crash.
