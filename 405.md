# Desynchronization Vulnerability in Cross-Chain Lending

### Summary

In cross-chain borrowing, a borrower may deposit collateral and then exit the source market. Unaware of this action, the destination chain proceeds to grant the loan.


### Root Cause

The source chain lacks a locking mechanism to secure the collateral once `borrowCrossChain()` is initiated. As a result, the borrower can exit the market before the loan is finalized. Since no data structures are updated to reflect the collateral lock, the destination chainâ€™s router, unaware of the change, proceeds to issue the loan.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower initiates cross chain loan.
2. Borrower has enough collateral on source chain at this point.
3. Favorable cross chain message is sent to the destination chain. 
4. Borrower exits the market.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. The borrower initiates a cross-chain loan request.
2. At the time of the request, sufficient collateral exists on the source chain.
3. A favorable cross-chain message is transmitted to the destination chain.
4. Before the loan is finalized, the borrower exits the market on the source chain, bypassing collateral locking.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows borrowers to receive loans on the destination chain without having their collateral securely locked on the source chain. As a result, malicious actors can effectively obtain uncollateralized loans, leading to potential financial losses for the lending protocol and undermining the trust and security of the cross-chain borrowing system.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a robust collateral locking mechanism on the source chain that updates relevant data structures immediately upon initiating `borrowCrossChain()`. Ensure the collateral remains locked and inaccessible until the loan process is fully completed or explicitly canceled. Additionally, incorporate cross-chain state verification or finality proofs so the destination chain can verify the collateral status before approving the loan.
