# Adding cross-chain borrow records with incorrect src & dst ids lowers overall debt of borrowers.

**Description:** 

During cross-chain borrows, a borrow record is added on the src chain when [_handleValidBorrowRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L722) gets called,

```bash 

    // Add new borrow record
    lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
        payload.sender,
        payload.srcToken,
        // review This should be Borrow(currentEid, srcEid) instead since this function runs when dst chain
        // sends back confirmation so srcEid is id of dst in this case.
        LendStorage.Borrow(
@>        srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
        )
    );

```

As observed, srcEid is provided as the first argument & currentEid is provided as the second. This is a problem since `_handleValidBorrowRequest` gets called as a confirmation sent back to source chain from dest chain with updated borrow details.
This means, here srcEid is layerzero id of the destination chain and Borrow.srcEid is being provided that even though it expects id of the source chain,

```javascript

    struct Borrow {
@>      uint256 srcEid; // Source chain's layer zero endpoint id
@>      uint256 destEid; // Destination chain's layer zero endpoint id
        uint256 principle; // Borrowed token amount
        uint256 borrowIndex; // Borrow index
        address borrowedlToken; // Address of the borrower
        address srcToken; // Source token address
    }

```

This directly impacts the output returned by `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest` which checks for `borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid` condition,

```bash
if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
    borrowedAmount +=
        (borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
}

```

The way the current implementation works, after a cross-chain borrow, id of destination chain gets stored in borrows[i].srcEid which means, on the source chain, the condition `borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid` will never be true. This implies, the sum of all cross-chain borrows with interest in underlying tokens returned by `borrowWithInterest` will be lower than actual value. This function is used by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to return borrowed & collateral values to check for liquidity shortfall. 

A lower value returned can have multiple negative impacts throughout the protocol. Like for instance, total borrowed value of a user could be higher than collateral value resuting in user getting liquidated but because the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` returns lower borrowed value than collateral value, user doesn't get liquidated even though they have liquidity shortfall. They'll also be able to borrow more than necessary and redeem easily due to this erroneous implementation.

**Impact:** 

Overall debt of borrowers is displayed incorrectly resulting in unallowed borrows, borrowers avoiding liquidations and redeems on liquidity shortfall.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. Alice has $100 worth collateral and $90 worth borrows.
2. Alice performs a cross-chain borrow using `borrowCrossChain`.
3. The operation succeeds and this results in borrows worth $110.
4. Alice has a bad debt and she should be liquidated.
5. The output returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` shows borrowed value still worth $90.
6. Alice cannot be liquidated.
7. Alice easily redeems her collateral even though there's a bad debt that needs to be repaid or get liquidated.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Consider the following mitigation in `CrossChainRouter::_handleValidBorrowRequest`,

```diff
            // Add new borrow record
            lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
                payload.sender,
                payload.srcToken,
                LendStorage.Borrow(
-                   srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
+                   currentEid, srcEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
                )
            );
