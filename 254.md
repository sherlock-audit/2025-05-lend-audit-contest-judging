# Cross-chain borrow and collateral invariant is not enforced properly

### Summary

The invariant that a token cannot have an entry in `crossChainCollaterals` and `crossChainBorrows` on the same chain is not properly enforced. If this is broken, all forms of cross-chain or same-chain borrows, redemptions,  or liquidations would fail.

### Root Cause

[LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385C14-L385C55) is used heavily during borrow/collateral modifications, within this function `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()` is called. This function is used to calculate the updated total borrow (same-chain and cross-chain) and collateral of the user. But the following check is used to make sure that the user does not have the same token entry as both a cross-chain collateral or borrow:

```solidity
    function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
        ...

        Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
        Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

        require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
        // Only one mapping should be populated:
       ...
    }
```

While this checks the invariant, the code itself does not appropriately prevent this state from being reached. Depending on how underlying token mappings are configured, there is a window of possibility where a chain that has a token entry in its `crossChainCollateral` can make a cross-chain borrow that ends up mapping that same token address in it's `crossChainBorrow`.

When this happens, all forms of same-chain or cross-chain borrow/collateral modification or even attempts to fetch data would result in reverts, thus DOSing the user and liquidators from liquidating his position.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Circular configuration of token mappings letting two cross-chain tokens map to each other.
2. User attempts cross-chain borrow from chain A, it works on chain B.
3. Chain B sends a confirmation cross-chain message which populates the users `crossChainBorrow` on chain A.
4. On repayment, borrowing, and even fetching cross-chain borrows - the invariant check triggers, and reverts subsequent transactions
5. User is unable to pay debt or get liquidated.

### Impact

User DoS leading to inability to borrow/redeem a position.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When attempting to make a cross-chain borrow using [CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L154), within this function, the borrowed token should be ensured to not have an entry in cross-chain collaterals:

```solidity
    function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
        ...

        require(lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(user, _borrowToken).length == 0, "token already used as cross-chain collateral");

        // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
        // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
            collateral,
            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
    }
```
