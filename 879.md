# If user first `supply()` and wait some time, he'll get his rewards overwritten if he calls `borrow()`

### Summary

If user first tokens via `supply()` and wait some time, he'll get his rewards overwritten when he calls `borrow()` due to the `distributeBorrowerLend()` touching the same mapping as in `distributeSupplierLend()` and overwriting the entire mapped instance, instead of incrementing it.

This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L334) and [here](distributeSupplierLend)

### Root Cause

The root cause is the overwriting of the mapping instance instead of incrementing it in both distribute functions mentioned above, leading to loss of all rewards accrued.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Explained in summary

### Impact

Loss of rewards in `mapping lendAccrued`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increment instead of overwrite in the function or create two separate mappings for that matter
