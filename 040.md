# `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` will use stale price feeds to update asset prices for core operations in lend protocol

### Summary

The `LendStorage` contracts require price feeds to correctly price assets for core operations, but the `pythOracle`  contract which it calls to get underlying price has a flawed price staleness check which causes core operations to use outdated or mispriced asset data for Sonic chain operations, leading to incorrect collateral valuations, improper borrow limits, and failed liquidations. The absence of proper updates to the `lastValidPrices` mapping in `PythOracle` means stale prices are not replaced with valid fallbacks, causing core lending operations to malfunction by mispricing assets critical to the protocol's functionality on the Sonic chain.

### Root Cause
References in code:  
In LendStorage where it calls price oracle: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L407

Pyth Oracle which will be used on sonic chain: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/Pyth/PythOracle.sol#L19

In `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`l which is called in `coreRouter` and `crossChainRouter` during: 
- Supply operations to check collateral value
- Borrow operations to verify collateralization
- Liquidation operations to check position health
- Redeem operations to verify sufficient liquidity
calls the `PythOracle` contract’s `getUnderlyingPrice` function when pricing assets on sonic which does not update the `lastValidPrices` mapping when valid prices are received, and its staleness check (block.timestamp - price.publishTime > STALENESS_THRESHOLD) fails to provide a reliable fallback when prices are stale or invalid. This leads to the use of outdated prices for collateral and borrow calculations, causing incorrect liquidity assessments. These mispriced assets propagate errors to `CrossChainRouter` and `CoreRouter`, disrupting Sonic chain lending operations like borrowing, redemption, and liquidation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

`LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calls `PythOracle.getUnderlyingPrice` to:
- Calculate collateral value for supplied assets using `UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset)`.
- Compute borrow values for borrowed assets, incorporating cross-chain and same-chain borrows.
- Assess the impact of redeeming or borrowing actions on account liquidity.

- Dependent Contracts:
  - CrossChainRouter relies on getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral for: Collateral sufficiency checks in `borrowCrossChain` and `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`.
  - Liquidation eligibility in _validateAndPrepareLiquidation and _checkLiquidationValid.

  - CoreRouter depends on it for:
    Collateral valuation in supply to mint lTokens.

   - Liquidity checks in borrow and redeem.

   - Liquidation thresholds in liquidateBorrow and liquidateBorrowInternal.

Price Feed Issue:
- The Pyth price feed for a Sonic chain token has a publishTime older than STALENESS_THRESHOLD (60 minutes).

`lastValidPrices` in `PythOracle` is empty or outdated due to missing updates.

`block.timestamp` exceeds` price.publishTime + STALENESS_THRESHOLD`, indicating a stale price.

Operations Triggered:
- Users attempt Sonic chain operations like supplying, borrowing, redeeming, repaying, or liquidating via CoreRouter or CrossChainRouter.



### External Pre-conditions

- The Pyth price feed for a Sonic chain token stops updating for over 60 minutes, resulting in a stale publishTime.

- The token’s price was valid at least once before becoming stale.



### Attack Path

- The Pyth price feed provides a stale price for a Sonic chain token (publishTime older than 60 minutes).

- PythOracle.getUnderlyingPrice fails to update lastValidPrices and returns a stale or invalid price without reverting, as no valid fallback exists.

- LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral uses the stale price to:
 - Miscalculate sumCollateral for supplied assets, leading to incorrect collateral valuations.
 - Miscalculate sumBorrowPlusEffects for borrowed assets, skewing borrow limits.
 - Incorrectly assess the impact of redeeming (redeemTokens) or borrowing (borrowAmount), producing flawed liquidity results.

- `CrossChainRouter` and `CoreRouter` use these incorrect liquidity values, leading to:
Over-borrowing or blocked borrows due to mispriced collateral in borrow or `borrowCrossChain`.
  - Incorrect redemption amounts in redeem, allowing excessive withdrawals or blocking valid ones.
  - Failed or improper liquidations in liquidateBorrow or liquidateCrossChain due to incorrect shortfall calculations.
  - The protocol continues with mispriced assets, compromising financial accuracy and operational reliability.


### Impact

HIGH: Mispriced assets from `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` disrupt Sonic chain lending operations, leading to financial inaccuracies and increased protocol risk.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix `PythOracle` Staleness Check and Last Valid Price Updates:
Update `getUnderlyingPrice` to store valid prices in `lastValidPrices` and enforce strict staleness checks, reverting if no valid fallback exists when prices are stale or invalid.
