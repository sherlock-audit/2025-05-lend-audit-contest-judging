# [H-03] Small Borrow Positions Can Become Unliquidatable Due to Rounding in `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`

### [H-03] Small Borrow Positions Can Become Unliquidatable Due to Rounding in `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`

**Description:** 
The `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount` function in `LendStorage` calculates the maximum amount that can be repaid during liquidation as `(currentBorrow * closeFactorMantissa) / 1e18`. If a borrower's outstanding debt `currentBorrow` is very small, this calculation can round down to zero due to integer division. 

This creates a scenario where a borrower with a very small outstanding debt cannot be liquidated at all, leaving the position "stuck" and unliquidatable. An attacker could deliberately exploit this by leaving a dust borrow that is below the threshold, preventing full liquidation and potentially cluttering protocol state.

**Impact:**  
- **Griefing/Denial of Liquidation:** Attackers or users can leave small borrow positions that cannot be liquidated, making unhealthy positions persist indefinitely.
- **Protocol State Pollution:** Over time, many such dust positions could accumulate, cluttering protocol state and making accounting more difficult.
- **Potential Risk to Protocol Health:** If these positions are unhealthy, they could contribute to protocol insolvency or reduce the effectiveness of the liquidation mechanism.

**Proof of Concept:**  
If `closeFactorMantissa = 0.5e16` (0.5%), and `currentBorrow = 100`:

```solidity
maxRepay = (100 * 0.5e16) / 1e18 = 0
```

```solidity
function test_small_borrow_unliquidatable_griefing() public {

uint256 supplyAmount = 1000e18; // Large supply to ensure we can borrow

for (uint256 smallBorrowAmount = 1; smallBorrowAmount <= 50; smallBorrowAmount++) {

// Supply collateral on Chain A

(address tokenA, address lTokenA) = _supplyA(deployer, supplyAmount, 0);

// Supply liquidity on Chain A from random wallet

(address tokenB, address lTokenB) = _supplyA(address(1), supplyAmount, 1);

// Create small borrow

vm.startPrank(deployer);

coreRouterA.borrow(smallBorrowAmount, tokenB);

vm.stopPrank();

// Simulate extreme price drop to make position liquidatable

uint256 newPrice = 1e14; // Price drop to 0.0001 of original price

priceOracleA.setDirectPrice(tokenA, newPrice);

// Check if position is liquidatable (shortfall > 0)

(,, uint256 shortfall) = lendtrollerA.getAccountLiquidity(deployer);

// Get max repay amount

uint256 maxRepay = lendStorageA.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(deployer, lTokenB, true);

console2.log("Borrowed amount:", smallBorrowAmount);

console2.log("Shortfall:", shortfall);

console2.log("Max repay amount:", maxRepay);

if (shortfall > 0) {

// The bug: maxRepay is zero or too small to allow liquidation

assertTrue(maxRepay == 0 || maxRepay < smallBorrowAmount, "Max repay is too small to allow liquidation (buggy rounding)");

} else {

// Not liquidatable, skip assertion

console2.log("Not liquidatable for borrow amount:", smallBorrowAmount);

}

}

}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
- **Set a Minimum Liquidation Amount:** Ensure that `maxRepay` is at least 1 (or another protocol-defined minimum) if `currentBorrow > 0`.
- **Alternative Calculation:** Use `max(currentBorrow * closeFactorMantissa / 1e18, minLiquidationAmount)` where `minLiquidationAmount` is a small, nonzero value.
