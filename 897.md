# Cross-Chain Self-Liquidation Violates Core Protocol Design

### Summary

The protocol's design explicitly prevents users from liquidating their own loan positions via the `require(params.borrower != msg.sender)` check. However, this core design intent is directly violated in a cross-chain environment when users manage assets through Account Abstraction (AA) wallets. A user can bypass this check and self-liquidate their positions, as their wallet addresses differ across chains for the same underlying account.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L198

The `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function, called by `liquidateCrossChain`, includes a `require(params.borrower != msg.sender, "Liquidator cannot be borrower");` check. This check intends to prevent a borrower from initiating a liquidation against their own loan. However, users with account abstraction wallets have a different address across different chains for the same account. Since params.borrower refers to the borrower's address on the source chain (Chain A) and msg.sender refers to the liquidator's address on the execution chain (Chain B), these addresses will be distinct, allowing the check to pass even when both accounts are managed by the same user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-   A user must have an outstanding cross-chain borrow position recorded on Chain A (e.g., associated with their smart account `0xBorrowerA`).
-   The protocol's `liquidateCrossChain` function must be callable on Chain B.

### External Pre-conditions

-   The user must have deployed and **manage** at least two distinct smart contract account instances (e.g., Safe accounts): one on Chain A (`0xBorrowerA`) and another on Chain B (`0xLiquidatorB`). Both accounts must be ultimately managed by the same underlying user (e.g., via the same EOA signer).
-   The user must have sufficient `borrowedAsset` tokens on Chain B to repay the desired `repayAmount` for the liquidation.

### Attack Path

1.  **Loan Origination (Chain A):** A user, managing `0xBorrowerA` (a Safe account) on Chain A, takes out a loan. This establishes `0xBorrowerA` as the `borrower` for that position.
2.  **Liquidation Attempt (Chain B):** The **same user**, managing `0xLiquidatorB` (a separate Safe account) on Chain B, calls the `liquidateCrossChain` function.
    -   The user passes `0xBorrowerA` as the `borrower` parameter to `liquidateCrossChain`.
    -   `msg.sender` within the `liquidateCrossChain` transaction on Chain B is `0xLiquidatorB`.
3.  **Bypass of Self-Liquidation Check:** Inside `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation`, the check `require(params.borrower != msg.sender);` is performed. Since `params.borrower` is `0xBorrowerA` and `msg.sender` is `0xLiquidatorB`, and these are distinct smart contract addresses, the condition `0xBorrowerA != 0xLiquidatorB` evaluates to `true`. The check passes, despite both accounts being managed by the same user.
4.  **Cross-Chain Execution:** The `_executeLiquidationCore` function sends a cross-chain message of `ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute` to Chain A, including `payload.sender` (which was `0xBorrowerA`) and `payload.liquidator` (which was `0xLiquidatorB`).
5.  **Liquidation Execution (Chain A):** On Chain A, `_lzReceive` processes the message and calls `_handleLiquidationExecute`. This function then proceeds to perform the liquidation:
    -   It calculates and assigns `liquidatorShare` (a portion of seized collateral) to `payload.liquidator` (`0xLiquidatorB`).
    -   It distributes LEND rewards to `payload.liquidator` (`0xLiquidatorB`).
    -   It reduces `totalInvestment` for `payload.sender` (`0xBorrowerA`).
    -   It emits a `LiquidateBorrow` event, logging `0xLiquidatorB` as the liquidator and `0xBorrowerA` as the borrower.

### Impact

This direct violation of the protocol's core design has several immediate and concrete consequences, as seen in the _handleLiquidationExecute function:

1.  Capture of Liquidator's Share of Seized Collateral:
    
    The liquidatorShare (calculated as payload.amount - protocolSeizeShare) is explicitly added to the liquidator's total investment (lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, ...)). By self-liquidating, the user effectively transfers a portion of their own seized collateral (the liquidatorShare) from their borrower-account to their liquidator-account, capturing an incentive intended for external liquidators.
    
2.  Capture of LEND Rewards for Liquidator:
    
    The protocol directly distributes LEND rewards to the liquidator (lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(payload.destlToken, payload.liquidator);). This provides an additional, direct financial benefit to the self-liquidating user, further subverting the intended incentive structure for external market participants.
    
3.  Controlled Seizure of User's Own Collateral:
    
    The liquidation process proceeds to reduce the borrower's total investment by the seized amount (lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken, ...)). This allows the user to trigger the seizure of their own collateral in a controlled manner, bypassing the competitive market dynamics that should govern liquidations.

### PoC

1.  User deploys a Safe account `A` on Chain A.
2.  User deploys a Safe account `B` on Chain B, using the same underlying EOA/keys as account `A`.
3.  User, via account `A` on Chain A, takes out a loan.
4.  User, via account `B` on Chain B, monitors their loan's health factor.
5.  When the loan becomes eligible for liquidation, user `B` calls `liquidateCrossChain(0xBorrowerA, repayAmount, ChainA_Eid, lTokenToSeize, borrowedAsset)`.
6.  The `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` function's `require(params.borrower != msg.sender)` check is passed because `0xBorrowerA != 0xLiquidatorB`.
7.  The liquidation proceeds cross-chain, resulting in `0xLiquidatorB` (controlled by the same user) receiving the `liquidatorShare` of seized collateral and LEND rewards, effectively self-liquidating.
