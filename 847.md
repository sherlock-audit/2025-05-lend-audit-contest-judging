# `CoreRouter.sol` uses unsafe transfer in some functions, risking user fund loss for tokens like USDT on Ethereum chain

### Summary

Several functions in `CoreRouter.sol` such as `borrowForCrossChain()`, `redeem()` and `borrow()` assume that every ERC20’s `transfer()` returns a boolean and will succeed. On Ethereum, USDT does not return a bool from `transfer()`. As a result:

Transfer operations in `CoreRouter.sol` for USDT can result in silent transfer failures for users as the contract will assume successful token transfers when using USDT which doesn't return boolean values from transfer functions on the Ethereum chain.


### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:124`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124), [`CoreRouter.sol:170`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L172) and [`CoreRouter.sol:204`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L204) `transfer()` is used to transfer underlying token to the user, and since the protocol plans to whitelist and use USDT. The problem occurs because:

- USDT on Ethereum mainnet does not return a boolean from its `transfer()` function
- The contract assumes all transfers succeed when no revert occurs
- Silent failures can occur where the state is updated but tokens are never transferred
- Users lose their collateral/lTokens while never receiving the underlying tokens


### Internal Pre-conditions

- The protocol must support USDT which is stated they will on the contest README.

### External Pre-conditions

- A transfer operation must fail silently (succeed internally but not transfer tokens)

### Vulnerability Path

1. User calls redeem() to withdraw their USDT collateral
2. Contract burns user's lTokens and updates internal accounting
3. `IERC20(USDT).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying)` is called
4. USDT transfer fails silently (no boolean returned, no revert)
5. Contract assumes success and completes the transaction
6. User loses their lTokens but never receives USDT

Similar scenarios occur for:

- `borrow()` - User's collateral is locked but they don't receive borrowed USDT
- `borrowForCrossChain()` - Cross-chain borrower doesn't receive USDT on destination chain

### Impact

Users suffer a 100% loss of their redeemed/borrowed token amounts when using USDT. The tokens become permanently locked in the contract while users lose their collateral or lTokens. This represents a fund loss vulnerability affecting core functionality.

### Mitigation

Replace all raw `IERC20(token).transfer()` calls with OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 wrappers:

```diff
-   IERC20(_token).transfer();
+   IERC20(_token).safeTransfer();
```
