# Users Can Borrow Exceeding the Collateral

### Summary
In the current implementation, users can borrow from chainA using collateral from chainA, and they can also borrow from chainB. However, when initiating a cross-chain borrow from chainA to chainB, users provide collateral without deducting the `borrowBalanceSameChain`. This allows the same collateral to be double-used on both chainA and chainB, resulting in users borrowing from both chains with the same collateral.

### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is that when starting a cross-chain borrow, the `borrowBalanceSameChain` is not deducted from the collateral amount.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path
N/A

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L147
```solidity
    function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
        ...
        // Get current collateral amount for the LayerZero message
        // This will be used on dest chain to check if sufficient
        (, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), 0, 0);

        // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
        // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
        _send(
            _destEid,
            _amount,
            0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
147:        collateral,
            msg.sender,
            destLToken,
            address(0), // liquidator
            _borrowToken,
            ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
        );
    }
```
As observed, the `borrowBalanceSameChain` is not deducted from the collateral amount sent to the destination chain.

### Impact
This flaw allows users to borrow beyond their collateral limits, which could result in significant losses for the protocol.

### Mitigation
Consider deducting the borrowBalanceSameChain from the collateralAmount when performing a cross-chain borrow.
