# User will be unable to borrow up to their full collateral capacity due to double application of interest calculation

### Summary

The double application of borrow index multiplication in `CoreRouter::borrow()` will cause an inflated borrowed amount calculation for borrowers as the calculation multiplies the already interest-accrued borrowed amount by additional interest factors, preventing users from borrowing up to their full collateral capacity.

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:158-162`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L158-L162), the `borrowed` variable returned from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` is already scaled with accumulated interest, but the code incorrectly applies the borrow index calculation again:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157-L161

The `borrowed` variable from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` already includes interest accrual through `borrowWithInterestSame()` and `borrowWithInterest()` functions, which calculate `(principle * currentBorrowIndex) / originalBorrowIndex`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User supplies collateral and makes an initial borrow
2. Time passes, allowing interest to accrue on the borrowed amount
3. User attempts to borrow additional tokens up to their collateral capacity
4. The `CoreRouter::borrow()` function calculates an inflated `borrowAmount` by double-applying the interest calculation
5. The transaction reverts with "Insufficient collateral" even though the user should have sufficient collateral

### Impact

Users cannot borrow up to their full collateral capacity after interest has accrued on their existing borrows. This reduces the protocol's capital efficiency and prevents users from accessing the full borrowing power their collateral should provide. The impact becomes more severe as more time passes and interest accumulates, effectively locking users out of additional borrowing despite having adequate collateral.

### PoC

Add the following failing test `test_borrow_calculation()` in `TestBorrowing.t.sol` to demonstrate this issue:

```solidity
function test_borrow_calculation() public {
    address user1 = makeAddr("user1");
    address user2 = makeAddr("user2");

    uint256 amount = 1000e18;
    address token = supportedTokens[0];
    address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

    vm.startPrank(deployer);

    ERC20Mock(token).mint(user1, amount);
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(user2, amount);

    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user1);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);
    coreRouter.supply(amount, token);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user2);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), amount);
    coreRouter.supply(amount, token);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user1);

    uint256 firstBorrowAmount = amount  / 10;

    coreRouter.borrow(firstBorrowAmount, token);

    // Advance some blocks to accrue interest
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1000);
    vm.roll(block.number + 1000);

    LToken(lToken).accrueInterest();

    (uint256 currentBorrowed, uint256 currentCollateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(user1, LToken(lToken), 0, 0);

    uint256 secondBorrowAmount = currentCollateral - currentBorrowed;

    // Reverts!!!
    coreRouter.borrow(secondBorrowAmount, token);
}
```

Run the test
```bash
forge test --mt test_borrow_calculation
```

Output:
```bash
Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/TestBorrowing.t.sol:TestBorrowing
[FAIL: revert: Insufficient collateral] test_borrow_calculation() (gas: 1227115)
```

### Mitigation

Remove the duplicate interest calculation in `CoreRouter::borrow()`. The `borrowed` variable should be used directly since it already includes accrued interest
