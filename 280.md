# No incentive to liquidate small positions could result in accumulation of bad debt

## Description:
The LEND protocol does not enforce minimum position sizes for deposits, loans, or liquidations, creating a scenario where small undercollateralized positions may accumulate because liquidators have no economic incentive to liquidate them. When gas costs exceed liquidation rewards, rational actors avoid liquidating these positions, allowing bad debt to persist in the system. This vulnerability could also make the protocol a target for coordinated attacks by whales or competitors who could intentionally create numerous small positions to destabilize the protocol.
The protocol's core functions lack minimum amount validations:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L61
```solidity
// CoreRouter.sol
function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // @audit no minimum deposit amount check
    address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);
    require(_lToken != address(0), "Unsupported Token");
    
    IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    _approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145
```solidity
// CoreRouter.sol
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _lToken) external {
    // @audit no minimum borrow amount check
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L230
```solidity
// CoreRouter.sol
function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset) external {
    // @audit no minimum liquidation amount or profitability check
    address payable borrowedlToken = payable(lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset));
    address collateral = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(lTokenCollateral);
    
    liquidateBorrowInternal(msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, borrowedlToken, collateral, borrowed);
}
```

Same in internal functions `liquidateBorrowInternal()` and `liquidateSeizeUpdate()`

Cross-chain operations exacerbate this issue due to additional LayerZero fees:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L172
```solidity
// CrossChainRouter.sol
function liquidateCrossChain(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, uint32 srcEid, address lTokenToSeize, address borrowedAsset) external {
    // @audit no consideration of cross-chain costs making small liquidations even more unprofitable
    _send(srcEid, repayAmount, 0, 0, borrower, address(0), msg.sender, borrowedAsset, ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute);
}
```
## Attack path:
Natural accumulation scenario:
Users create small positions that become undercollateralized during market volatility
Liquidators calculate that gas costs exceed liquidation rewards 
Rational liquidators avoid unprofitable liquidations, leaving undercollateralized positions in the system

Coordinated attack scenario:
A malicious whale or competitor can create thousands of small positions across multiple chains, which may become undercollateralized and lead the protocol to go underwater.

## Impact:
Small undercollateralized positions remain unliquidated, creating permanent protocol losses
Accumulated bad debt could exceed protocol reserves, threatening overall solvency
Higher liquidation costs due to LayerZero fees make the problem worse across all supported chains
Protocol becomes attractive target for whales or competitors who can systematically create unprofitable-to-liquidate positions

## Recommended Mitigation:
Implement minimum position sizes
Add minimum liquidation profitability checks
