# System will understate liabilities for Borrowers leading to Protocol Insolvency by bad condition in `borrowWithIntest`

### Summary

A flaw in debt calculation logic in `LendStorage.borrowWithInterest()` will cause an understating of actual cross-chain debt for **borrowers**. This allows **borrowers** to take on more debt than their collateral supports, potentially leading to protocol insolvency as the **protocol** accrues unrecoverable bad debt.

### Root Cause

- In [LendStorage.sol:478](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504) (within the `borrowWithInterest` function), the conditions used to sum borrowed amounts for cross-chain scenarios are incorrect:
    - When iterating `crossChainBorrows` (on the collateral chain), the condition `borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid` will be false for actual cross-chain borrows where `srcEid` (borrow chain EID) differs from `currentEid` (collateral chain EID).
    - When iterating `crossChainCollaterals` (on the borrow chain), the condition `collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid` will be false for actual cross-chain borrows, as `srcEid` (collateral chain EID) will not match `currentEid` (borrow chain EID). This prevents these debts from being counted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A **borrower** has an existing cross-chain borrow, meaning their debt information is stored in `crossChainCollaterals` on the borrow chain (Chain B) or `crossChainBorrows` on the collateral chain (Chain A).
2. The `LendStorage.borrowWithInterest()` function is called on Chain B to assess this **borrower's** total debt for a specific `_lToken`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The **protocol** calls `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` for a **borrower**.
2. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` internally calls `LendStorage.borrowWithInterest()` to determine the **borrower's** existing cross-chain debt.
3. Due to the flawed conditions, `borrowWithInterest()` returns `0` for the **borrower's** actual cross-chain debt portion.
4. The **protocol** then uses this understated total debt to make decisions.

### Impact

The **protocol** suffers from an inability to correctly assess user liabilities, leading to:
-  **Borrowers** being able to borrow far more than their collateral safely allows.
- Prevention of necessary liquidations for undercollateralized positions.
- Accumulation of bad debt, risking protocol insolvency and loss of funds for other **users** or the **protocol** itself.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct the conditional logic within `LendStorage.borrowWithInterest()` to accurately identify and sum cross-chain debts. For example, when processing `crossChainCollaterals` on the borrow chain, the condition should check `collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid != currentEid`.
