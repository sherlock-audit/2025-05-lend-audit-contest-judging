# Malicious User can Liquidate Health Positions

### Summary

In `liquidateBorrow`, it is possible to trigger a liquidation of collateral that is different from what was originally used to open a position.A malicious user will call the function against a borrower who mantains a healthy,solvent position provided the borrower holds multiple types of collateral. By selecting a specific `lTokenCollateral` that a borrower possesses, even if the overall account is not shortfall, the protocol will proceed seizing a portion of the specified collateral. This allows for seizure of assets from a solvent user.

### Root Cause


The root cause of this vulnerability is the insufficient input validation within the liquidateBorrow function. Specifically, the function does not adequately verify that the lTokenCollateral specified by the liquidator is the appropriate collateral to be seized for the given borrowed asset.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Multiple Collateral Types in Borrower's Account:

### External Pre-conditions

- Liquidator has sufficient funds of the borrowedAsset to repay portion of debt
- Attacker knows addresses of the borrower

### Attack Path

#### Borrower (Alice):
- Borrows 1000 USDC.
- Collateral: 50 ETH (valued at 1000 USDC) and 50 WBTC (valued at 1000 USDC).
- Total collateral value: 2000 USDC.
- Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio: 100/2000 = 5% (which is healthy, assuming the liquidation threshold is 75%).

#### Liquidator (Bob):
- Has 10 USDC available to repay part of the debt.

Despite Alice being solvent and her collateral being more than sufficient, Bob can target and liquidate specific collateral (e.g., 50 ETH or 50 WBTC) by specifying the wrong `lTokenCollateral` in the liquidation function.
This will lead to an unintended seizure of assets from Aliceâ€™s account, even though she is not in a shortfall state.


### Impact

Solvent users will be liquidated without being in a short fall state

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check whether the collateral token used in liquidation is the one that was used to borrow the loan
