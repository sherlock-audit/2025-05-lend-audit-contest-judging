# Invariant in borrowWithInterest can be violated causing DoS

### Summary

The `borrowWithInterest` function assumes a critical invariant: a user cannot simultaneously have both cross-chain borrows and cross-chain collaterals for the same token. This assumption is enforced via the following `require` statement:

```solidity
require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated")
```

However, this invariant is easily breakable and does not reflect actual protocol behavior. A user can legitimately end up in a state where they have both cross-chain borrows and cross-chain collaterals for the same token, which will cause this `require` to fail.

Since `borrowWithInterest` is widely used in key functions like `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, which is further used in core functionalities like borrow checks and liquidation logic, violating this assumption results in denial of service (DoS) across many functions.

```solidity
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
    Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];

    // @audit-issue This assumption is incorrect and can easily break:
    require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");

       ...

    return borrowedAmount;
}
```

### Root Cause

The protocol incorrectly assumes that a user cannot have both cross-chain borrows and cross-chain collaterals for the same token at the same time, which is not enforced elsewhere and can occur naturally through legitimate borrowing actions across multiple chains.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice initiates a cross-chain borrow of 1000 USDC on Arbitrum, sourced from Ethereum. This creates a `crossChainBorrows[Alice][USDC]` entry on Ethereum.
2. Later, Alice takes another cross-chain borrow of 1000 USDC on Ethereum, sourced from Optimism. This creates a `crossChainCollaterals[Alice][USDC]` entry on Ethereum.
3. Now both `crossChainBorrows[Alice][USDC]` and `crossChainCollaterals[Alice][USDC]` have non-zero length.
4. Any function calling `borrowWithInterest(Alice, cUSDC)` on Ethereum will revert due to the broken invariant:
   require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
5. A malicious borrower can use this to block liquidations of his positions, because he can always make the statement pass anytime by repaying a cross-chain borrow.

### Impact

- Core borrowing and liquidation related functions will be blocked.
- Malicious users can exploit this to avoid.


### PoC

_Not included_

### Mitigation

Remove the `require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0)` invariant.
