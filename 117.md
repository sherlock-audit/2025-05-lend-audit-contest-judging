# User will increase same-chain debt on destination chain by repaying cross-chain debt

### Summary

Incorrect borrow amount calculation in cross-chain repayments will cause a borrow to create new debt when repaying their cross-chain debt in a non fully way.

### Root Cause

When the user repays a cross-chain debt by calling `CrossChainRouter::repayCrossChainBorrow()` in one chain, this invokes `CoreRouter::repayBorrowInternal()` with `_isSameChain = false`.

In `CoreRouter::repayBorrowInternal()` the condition `repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount` uses different borrow amount calculations for same-chain vs cross-chain repayments, but applies the same debt clearing logic regardless of the repayment type. This will cause that in the case a user partially repays their cross-chain debt, they will create new debt on the same-chain or increase their existing one by calling `lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance()`, setting the new borrow balance to `borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **User borrows 1000 tokens on chain B** by calling `CoreRouter::borrow()` with `_amount = 1000` and `_token = USDC`
2. **User initiates cross-chain borrow of 100 tokens** on chain B from collateral on chain A through the cross-chain router in chain A
3. **User repays the cross-chain debt fully** by calling repay through the cross-chain liquidation mechanism with `_amount = 100`
4. **The system incorrectly creates new debt**

### Impact

The user will lose funds because they will have to pay new debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It should also check for _isSameChain before calling `lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance()`
