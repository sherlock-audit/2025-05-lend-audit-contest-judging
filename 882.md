# Incorrect Handling of Fee-on-Transfer Underlying Tokens in CoreRouter::redeem

### Summary


The CoreRouter::redeem function calculates the amount of underlying tokens a user should receive based on the LToken exchange rate and the amount of LTokens being redeemed. However, it fails to account for potential transfer fees on the underlying token when the LToken contract transfers the tokens to the CoreRouter. This results in the CoreRouter receiving less underlying tokens than expected, leading to incorrect transfers to the user, which can cause transactions to revert or trap funds within the CoreRouter contract.

### Vulnerability Description:

The `CoreRouter::redeem` function is designed to allow users to exchange their LTokens for the corresponding underlying asset. The process involves:

Calculating the expectedUnderlying amount based on the user's LToken amount (_amount) and the LToken's exchange rate (exchangeRateBefore).
Calling `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)` on the LToken contract. This call triggers the LToken to burn the specified amount of LTokens held by the CoreRouter and transfer the corresponding amount of underlying tokens to the CoreRouter contract.
Transferring the pre-calculated expectedUnderlying amount from the CoreRouter contract to the user (msg.sender).
The vulnerability arises when the underlying token (_token) is a fee-on-transfer token (e.g., some deflationary tokens or tokens with built-in taxes). In such cases, when the LToken contract executes its internal transfer of the underlying token to the CoreRouter (via its doTransferOut function), a portion of the transferred amount is deducted as a fee by the underlying token contract. Consequently, the CoreRouter contract receives less than the full amount the LToken intended to send.

The CoreRouter contract, however, proceeds to transfer the originally calculated expectedUnderlying amount to the user. Since expectedUnderlying does not account for the fee deducted during the transfer from the LToken to the CoreRouter, it is likely greater than the actual amount of underlying tokens the CoreRouter received.

If expectedUnderlying is greater than the actual amount received by CoreRouter, the final IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying) call will revert due to insufficient balance in the CoreRouter contract. This prevents the user from redeeming their assets.
In edge cases where the fee is very small, the transfer might succeed, but the user receives slightly less than they should have based on the LToken exchange rate, while the small fee amount is effectively lost or trapped in the CoreRouter.
Root Cause:


### Root Cause


The root cause is the CoreRouter's failure to measure the actual amount of underlying tokens received from the LToken contract after the redeem call. It relies on a calculated `expectedUnderlying` value that does not consider external factors like transfer fees applied by the underlying token contract during the transfer from the LToken to the CoreRouter.

Relevant Code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124

CoreRouter.sol:

```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        // ... checks ...

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens // <--- Calculation based on expected value
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

        // Perform redeem // <--- LToken transfers underlying to CoreRouter (fee may be deducted here)
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user // <--- Attempts to transfer the expected amount
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

        // ... state updates and event ...
    }
```
LToken.sol (within redeemFresh):

```solidity
    function redeemFresh(address payable redeemer, uint256 redeemTokensIn, uint256 redeemAmountIn) internal {
        // ... calculations for redeemTokens and redeemAmount ...

        /*
         * We invoke doTransferOut for the redeemer and the redeemAmount.
         *  Note: The lToken must handle variations between ERC-20 and ETH underlying.
         *  On success, the lToken has redeemAmount less of cash.
         *  doOut reverts if anything goes wrong, since we can't be sure if side effects occurred.
         */
        doTransferOut(redeemer, redeemAmount); // <--- This is where the underlying token is transferred.
                                               // If 'redeemer' is CoreRouter and the underlying token
                                               // has a transfer fee, CoreRouter receives less than 'redeemAmount'.

        // ... state updates and events ...
    }

    // Example of doTransferOut (implementation varies for LErc20 vs LEth)
    // In LErc20.sol, doTransferOut calls underlying.transfer(to, amount)
    function doTransferOut(address payable to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        // This function is implemented in child contracts like LErc20.sol
        // For LErc20, it would typically look like:
        // IERC20(underlying).transfer(to, amount);
        // If underlying is fee-on-transfer, 'to' (CoreRouter) receives less than 'amount'.
    }
```
The `LToken::doTransferOut` function is responsible for sending the underlying tokens. When called during a redeem operation initiated by CoreRouter, the redeemer address passed to redeemFresh is the CoreRouter contract's address `(address(this)` from the perspective of the `LToken`). If the underlying token's transfer function deducts a fee, the CoreRouter will receive a smaller amount than the redeemAmount calculated by the `LToken`.

### Impact

Impact:

Failed Redemptions: Users may be unable to redeem their LTokens if the underlying token has a transfer fee, as the final transfer from `CoreRouter` to the user will likely revert.
Trapped Funds: In some scenarios, small amounts of underlying tokens corresponding to the transfer fee can become trapped in the `CoreRouter` contract.
Inaccurate User Experience: Users expect to receive an amount of underlying tokens directly proportional to the LTokens they redeem based on the current exchange rate. Fee-on-transfer tokens break this expectation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this, the CoreRouter should measure the actual amount of underlying tokens it receives from the LToken contract after calling `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)`. This can be done by checking the CoreRouter's underlying token balance before and after the LToken redeem call. The CoreRouter should then transfer this actual received amount to the user. This approach correctly handles both exchange rate fluctuations and transfer fees on the underlying token.
