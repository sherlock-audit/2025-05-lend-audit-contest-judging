# Stale Exchange Rate in Supply/Redeem Allows Collateral Inflation


*An attacker will inflate their collateral value and over-borrow assets from the protocol*

## Summary

*Using the stale exchange rate in CoreRouter.sol when calculating minted lTokens will cause a loss of funds for the protocol as attackers will manipulate the exchange rate to artificially inflate their collateral position and borrow more than allowed.*

## Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol:73-79` the exchange rate is retrieved *before* calling `mint()` and then used to calculate the number of lTokens credited to the user:

```solidity
// Get exchange rate before mint
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
// Mint lTokens
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
// Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```

This is problematic because `mint()` internally calls `accrueInterest()` which updates the exchange rate, but CoreRouter uses the stale rate for its accounting.

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. Time has passed since the last interest accrual, making the stored exchange rate outdated
2. User must have supplied collateral to the protocol previously
3. The CoreRouter contract must be properly set up with at least one supported lToken

## External Pre-conditions

1. No specific external preconditions needed

## Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies when the exchange rate is about to increase (e.g., after significant time has passed since last interest accrual)
2. Attacker calls a function like `borrowCrossChain()` that forces interest accrual on the collateral token
3. Immediately after, attacker calls `supply()` in CoreRouter to deposit collateral
4. CoreRouter reads the old exchange rate using `exchangeRateStored()` 
5. CoreRouter calls `mint()` which internally calls `accrueInterest()`, updating the exchange rate
6. CoreRouter calculates `mintTokens` using the stale rate, crediting attacker with more lTokens than actually minted
7. Attacker uses this inflated collateral to borrow more assets than they should be allowed to
8. When attacker attempts to redeem, they receive fewer underlying tokens than expected in internal accounting, creating further imbalances

## Impact

*The protocol suffers a loss of funds as attackers can borrow more than their actual collateral allows. In a significant market with substantial interest accumulation, the attacker could artificially inflate their collateral by several percentage points, potentially borrowing thousands of dollars more than allowed by their actual collateral.*

## PoC



## Mitigation

There are several ways to fix this issue:

1. Call `accrueInterest()` before reading the exchange rate
2. Read the exchange rate after the mint operation
3. Use the actual number of lTokens received from the `mint()` operation instead of calculating it
