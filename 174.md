# Double Interest Calculation in CoreRouter.borrow


## Summary
A double interest calculation in CoreRouter will cause an incorrect assessment of user borrowing capacity and liquidation eligibility for protocol users as borrowers will experience reduced borrowing limits and may face premature liquidation when their positions should still be healthy.

## Root cause
In the contract incorrectly applies interest scaling to values that already include accrued interest.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157

### Internal Pre-conditions
N/A

### External Pre-conditions
None. This issue is entirely internal to the protocol's own implementation.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits collateral and takes an initial loan
2. Time passes and interest accrues, increasing the borrowIndex
3. When user attempts to borrow again, `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` correctly calculates their position with interest included
4. CoreRouter.borrow incorrectly scales the already-interest-adjusted value by the ratio of current/stored borrowIndex
5. This results in the calculated borrowAmount being larger than it should be (by exactly the interest percentage accrued)
6. The user's borrowing capacity is reduced because the system thinks they've borrowed more than they actually have

### Impact
The protocol users suffer reduced borrowing capacity directly proportional to the interest accrued since their last borrow. Our tests show that with just a 10% increase in interest (borrowIndex changing from 1.0 to 1.1), the user's calculated debt is inflated by exactly 10%. This significantly reduces borrowable amounts and can lead to incorrect liquidations.

     * @notice Tests the double interest calculation issue in CoreRouter.borrow
     * @dev This test:
     *  1. Supplies collateral
     *  2. Makes an initial borrow to establish a borrow balance
     *  3. Manipulates the borrow index to simulate time passing and interest accruing
     *  4. Tries a second borrow to show the incorrect calculation

### Mitigation
The fix is straightforward:

1. In the `borrow` function, replace:
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;
```
with:
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = borrowed;
```
