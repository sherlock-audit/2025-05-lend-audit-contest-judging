# Protocol rewards tokens permanently stuck

### Summary

During liquidations, the protocol seizes a portion of collateral tokens (2.8%) as protocol rewards. These seized tokens are tracked in the `protocolReward` mapping but have no mechanism for withdrawal, causing them to be permanently stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol`, the protocol [calculates and stores](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L300) its share of seized tokens during liquidations:

```solidity
uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));
lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
```

The `PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA` is set to 2.8% (2.8e16), meaning the protocol claims 2.8% of all seized collateral. However, there are no functions in `LendStorage.sol`, `CoreRouter.sol`, or `CrossChainRouter.sol` that allow withdrawal or utilization of these accumulated rewards.

The only function that modifies `protocolReward` is `updateProtocolReward()`, which can only increase the balance but never decrease it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This is not an attack but a design flaw:

1. The user's position becomes liquidable due to market conditions
2. Liquidator calls `liquidateBorrowInternal()` 
3. Protocol calculates its 2.8% share: `currentReward = seizeTokens * 0.028`
4. Protocol share is added to `protocolReward[lTokenCollateral]` mapping
5. Remaining tokens (97.2%) go to the liquidator
6. Protocol's 2.8% share remains permanently stuck with no withdrawal mechanism

### Impact

**High** - Protocol loses access to earned revenue from liquidations. Over time, significant value accumulates in the contract that cannot be recovered, representing a permanent loss of protocol funds that could be used for:
- Treasury operations
- Development funding  
- Emergency reserves
- Governance token buybacks

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

The protocol team should reassess the intended usage of liquidation-seized funds and implement appropriate mechanisms accordingly. Potential approaches include:

- Adding accumulated protocol rewards to existing reserve mechanisms.
- Establishing governance-controlled usage of these accumulated assets.
