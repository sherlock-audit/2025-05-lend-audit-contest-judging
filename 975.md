# Missing validation check for receive payload

## Summary

The `CrossChainRouter` contract does not validate the structure or contents of the incoming `payload` in its [`_lzReceive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L742C4-L785C6)  flow. If a malformed or unexpected `payload` is delivered, the contract may enter an invalid state, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) or logical disruption.

---

## Root Cause

In [`CrossChainRouter._lzReceive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L742C4-L785C6) , the contract calls:
```solidity
abi.decode(
    _payload,
    (
        uint256,  // amount
        uint256,  // borrowIndex
        uint256,  // collateral
        address,  // sender
        address,  // destToken
        address,  // liquidator
        address,  // srcToken
        uint8     // contractType
    )
);
```
There is no prior check on:
- `payload.length` (total byte size),
- Valid ranges for each decoded field (e.g. nonzero addresses or amounts),
- A “version/tag” to identify which payload format to expect.

Even that there are some checks in the invoked functions, as a result:
- A too-short `payload` (length < expected bytes) reverts at `abi.decode`.
- A correctly sized but semantically invalid `payload` (zero addresses, zeros in critical fields, misaligned field order) decodes successfully but leads to incorrect business logic downstream.

## Preconditions

### Internal Preconditions
N/A

### External Preconditions
   - **Scenario A**: `payload.length < expectedLength`.
   - **Scenario B**: `payload` is of correct byte length, but field order or values are invalid (e.g. zero addresses, unexpected `contractType`).

---

## Path

1. Calls to `lzReceive` on `CrossChainRouter` with a crafted “bad” `payload`:
   - **Scenario A**: Use a too-short payload, e.g. `bytes payload = hex"1234";`.
   - **Scenario B**: Use a correct-length payload but swap fields or set addresses/amounts to zero.

2. Inside `_lzReceive`, the `abi.decode(_payload, (…))` call attempts to unpack data:
   - **Scenario A**: Decoding reverts immediately because the `payload` is shorter than the expected total (3×32 bytes + 4×20 bytes + 1 byte = 177 bytes).
     - The entire cross-chain message fails (no business logic runs).
     - No retry logic is in place, so the router becomes blocked on that `nonce`.
   - **Scenario B**: Decoding succeeds (because length is correct), but yields invalid field values:
     - Downstream logic (e.g. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`) proceeds incorrectly:
       - Zero-amount loans could “succeed” silently or misattribute collateral.
       - Subsequent `require` checks might pass or revert arbitrarily, corrupting router state.

---

## Impact

- A single malformed payload can irreversibly make the router’s state wrong
- Silent failures (e.g. zero‐amount transactions still debited on origin chain but never credited).
- Unexpected reverts during storage updates (e.g. division by zero or underflow).
- Users may lose funds.
