# CrossChainRouter##liquidateCrossChain will always be rendered inoperable due to potential division by 0

### Summary

The [liquidateCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L172) function is used for initiating cross chain liquidations. What the function does is that prepares the memory [LiquidationParams struct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L179) and calls the internal functions with passing in that struct field as the input params. Now the `executeLiquidation` internal function calls another internal function i.e `_prepareLiquidationValues` and this function returns the maxLiquidation amount and this is done by using the `currentBorrow` variable
```solidity
    function _prepareLiquidationValues(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params)
        private
        returns (uint256 maxLiquidation)
    {
        // Accrue interest
        LTokenInterface(params.borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();
        uint256 currentBorrowIndex = LTokenInterface(params.borrowedlToken).borrowIndex();


        // Calculate current borrow value with accrued interest
        uint256 currentBorrow = (params.borrowPrinciple * currentBorrowIndex) / params.storedBorrowIndex; //AUDIT- div by 0


        // Verify repay amount is within limits
        maxLiquidation = mul_ScalarTruncate(
            Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), currentBorrow
        );


        return maxLiquidation;
    }
```
In the above snippet we can see that the `currentBorrow` is calculated as `(params.borrowPrinciple * currentBorrowIndex) / params.storedBorrowIndex;`. The issue is with this division that is done with `params.storedBorrowIndex`. This is the same struct that i mentioned above was passed in as input params. And the field that is passed we can see that this `storedBorrowIndex` was assigned to 0:
```solidity
    function liquidateCrossChain(
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint32 srcEid,
        address lTokenToSeize,
        address borrowedAsset
    ) external {
        LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params = LendStorage.LiquidationParams({
            borrower: borrower,
            repayAmount: repayAmount,
            srcEid: srcEid,
            lTokenToSeize: lTokenToSeize, // Collateral lToken from the user's position to seize
            borrowedAsset: borrowedAsset,
            storedBorrowIndex: 0, // <-
            borrowPrinciple: 0,
            borrowedlToken: address(0)
        });


        _validateAndPrepareLiquidation(params);
        _executeLiquidation(params);
    }
```


### Root Cause

The struct passed in as input para during cross chain liquidations, In that the [storedBorrowIndex](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L185) field is set to 0.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user getting liquidated i.e a liquidator calls the `liquidateCrossChain` function on a user who can be liquidated

### External Pre-conditions

Liquidator calling the `liquidateCrossChain` function

### Attack Path

1. Suppose a borrower has borrowed some amount and later then his borrowedAmount > collateral provided
2. Liquidator then calls the `liquidateCrossChain` function

### Impact

The impact is high here, as the function will be rendered inoperable and the borrower whose collateral's value has gone down, will never get liquidate as the code will just panic due to the divison by 0i

### PoC

### Mitigation

set the `storedBorrowIndex` with a correct value instead passing in 0
