# AccureInterest not called when redeeming collateral

## Summary
In the protocol users can supply collateral to the protocol in which other users can borrow from their collateral and repay back the tokens with interest , However accureInterest () is not called when redeeming leading to loss in interest.
## Description
```solidity
function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
        // Redeem lTokens
        address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

        require(_amount > 0, "Zero redeem amount");

        // Check if user has enough balance before any calculations
        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Check liquidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");

        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

        // Perform redeem
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
As we can see when redeeming accureInterest is not called to calculate interest earned from the borrowers of the collateral allowing the lender to miss out on interest for lending tokens

## Attack Path
1. Supplier supplies tokens to the protocol
2. Borrower borrows from this token with interest
3. After borrowing the tokens the borrower repays back with interest
4. Lender tries to redeem his tokens `accureInterest` not called leading to missing interest
## Impact
Loss of  interest for supplying collateral
## Recommended Mitigation
When redeeming call accureInterest() to prevent missing interest from leaving the vault
