# Reentrancy Potential in the `redeem` and `borrow` Functions

## Vulnerability Details
In the `redeem` and `borrow` functions, states related to investments and borrowings are updated after transferring underlying token to the user ([+](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124)) ([+](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170)). This creates a potential reentrancy vulnerability where a malicious user can repeatedly call these functions during a transfer, potentially draining all underlying asset from the contract.

## Proof of Concept
Here's a scenario demonstrating the vulnerability in the `redeem` function:
- The attacker calls the `redeem` function with a specified `_amount`.
- After transferring `_amount` of the underlying token to the attacker's address, the fallback function of the attacker contract is triggered.
- The fallback function calls `redeem` again before the `totalInvestment` state variable has been updated.
- Because the state hasn't been updated, the checks passes again, and tokens are transferred once more.
- This process can be looped multiple times, allowing the attacker to drain the entire asset balance of the contract.

## Impact
An attacker could drain the contract's entire underlying token balance, effectively stealing all assets held within the contract.

## Mitigation
Apply the `nonReentrant` modifier to both the `redeem` and `borrow` functions to prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, follow the [checks-effects-interactions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#reentrancy) pattern by updating all state variables before making external calls. This approach ensures that the contractâ€™s state is consistent and prevents reentrant exploits.
