# Malicious supplier will over-credit collateral and underfund reserves, harming the protocol and honest lenders.

### Summary

Using the pre-mint exchangeRateStored() will cause an over-credit of minted lTokens for the protocol and its users as a malicious supplier will advance blocks so interest accrues, then supply large amounts, repeat, and borrow against the phantom collateral to drain liquidity.

### Root Cause

Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74-L89

```solidity
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;   // ← stale rate
```
exchangeRateStored() is fetched before mint().
Because mint() calls accrueInterest(), the exchange-rate may increase in the same transaction; the subsequent mintTokens computation therefore over-estimates the tokens actually minted and over-credits the user’s collateral balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any borrower must have already opened a debt position so that
totalBorrows in the lToken market is greater than 0.

2. At least one new block (or more) must elapse after the last accrueInterest() call, allowing the cached
exchangeRateStored to increase.

3. Attacker (supplier) must approve the CoreRouter to spend their underlying and then call
CoreRouter.supply(amount, token) while the router still holds the stale exchange-rate value read in step 2.

With these conditions met, the router will compute mintTokens from the outdated exchange-rate and over-credit the attacker’s collateral balance.

### External Pre-conditions

1. [Blockchain] must advance by ≥ 1 block (or equivalent wall-clock time) after the last accrueInterest() so that a new call to accrueInterest() will modify on-chain accounting.

2. [Interest-rate model] must return a positive borrow-rate, causing accrueInterest() to add interest to totalBorrows and raise the exchange-rate.

3. [lToken implementation] must execute accrueInterest() inside its mint() function (Compound-style behaviour).

With those external conditions in place, every call to mint() from the CoreRouter will bump the exchange-rate and create the stale-rate mismatch exploited in the attack.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker supplies some collateral and then opens a small borrow in the same market (or any borrower already exists).
Result: totalBorrows > 0, so future accrueInterest() can raise the exchange-rate.

2. The attacker (or simply the passage of time) lets one or more blocks elapse.
Result: exchangeRateStored is now stale; the next accrueInterest() call will increase it.

3. Attacker calls CoreRouter.supply(A) with a large underlying amount A.
Router flow:
     3.1 reads exchangeRateStored() → R₀;
     3.2 calls mint(A).

4. Inside mint(A) the lToken executes accrueInterest(), raising the rate to R₁ = R₀ + Δ and mints
actualMint = A / R₁ lTokens to the router.

5. Returning to the router, it computes
mintTokens = A / R₀ (using the stale R₀), which is larger than actualMint, and stores that inflated value in lendStorage.totalInvestment[attacker].

6. Attacker immediately calls borrow() (or later redeem()) to extract value:
Borrow limit is based on the inflated collateral balance.
They can drain extra underlying or later redeem more than they are entitled to.

7. The attacker may loop: wait more blocks, supply again, and accumulate ever-growing phantom collateral until protocol solvency is jeopardized or honest suppliers are under-paid.

### Impact

The protocol’s liquidity pool and honest suppliers suffer an unbounded loss equal to the phantom lTokens credited to the attacker (≈ Δ / R × every supplied amount).
For example, with a 0.2 % rate drift an attacker who repeatedly supplies 10 000 e18 underlying is over-credited by ≈ 20 lTokens per cycle, allowing them to borrow or redeem an extra ≈ 200 underlying each time. Over many cycles this drains real cash from the pool while the attacker gains the same amount.

### PoC

Add this test in the TestSupplying.t.sol:

```solidity
   function test_mintTokenAccountingMismatch() public {
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------- //
    // 1. PREP: choose token / lToken and create another account "borrower"  //
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------- //
    address token  = supportedTokens[0];
    address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);

    address borrower = makeAddr("borrower");

    uint256 collateral = 50 ether;   // borrower supplies 50 tokens
    uint256 debt      = 10 ether;    // borrower will borrow 10 tokens

    // ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    // 2. Borrower supplies collateral so that the market has debt //
    // ----------------------------------------------------------- //
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(borrower, collateral);
    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), collateral);
    coreRouter.supply(collateral, token);   // borrower supplies

    // ------------------------- //
    // 3. Borrower opens a debt  //
    // ------------------------- //
    coreRouter.borrow(debt, token);         // same asset borrow is allowed in this fork
    vm.stopPrank();

    // ----------------------------------------------- //
    // 4. FAST-FORWARD time so interest can accumulate //
    // ----------------------------------------------- //
    vm.roll(block.number + 100);             // move 100 blocks
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 hours);      // +1 hour

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------- //
    // 5. Deployer will now supply; capture exchange-rate BEFORE minting //
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------- //
    uint256 supplyAmount = 100 ether;
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(deployer, supplyAmount);

    vm.startPrank(deployer);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouter), supplyAmount);

    uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(lToken).exchangeRateStored();
    uint256 expectedMintTokens = (supplyAmount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

    uint256 lTokenBalBefore = LTokenInterface(lToken).balanceOf(address(coreRouter));

    // --------------------------- //
    // 6. Call supply() – the bug  //
    // --------------------------- //
    coreRouter.supply(supplyAmount, token);

    uint256 lTokenBalAfter  = LTokenInterface(lToken).balanceOf(address(coreRouter));
    uint256 actualMinted    = lTokenBalAfter - lTokenBalBefore;

    uint256 recordedInvestment = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);

    // ------------------------------------------------------------- //
    // 7. Logs & assertion – recordedInvestment should be **bigger** //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------- //
    console2.log("exchangeRateBefore:", exchangeRateBefore);
    console2.log("expectedMintTokens:", expectedMintTokens);
    console2.log("actualMinted      :", actualMinted);
    console2.log("recordedInvestment:", recordedInvestment);

    assertGt(
        recordedInvestment,
        actualMinted,
        "CoreRouter incorrectly credits more lTokens than were minted"
    );

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

Calculate minted lTokens from the balance-delta, not from a cached exchange-rate

```solidity
function supply(uint256 amount, address token) external {
    address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(token);
    …
    uint256 balBefore = LTokenInterface(lToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(LErc20Interface(lToken).mint(amount) == 0, "mint failed");
    uint256 balAfter  = LTokenInterface(lToken).balanceOf(address(this));

    uint256 mintTokens = balAfter - balBefore;        // ← exact
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(msg.sender, lToken,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, lToken) + mintTokens);
    …
}
```
