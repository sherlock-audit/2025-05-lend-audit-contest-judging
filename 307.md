# Protocol will allow invalid liquidation due to incorrect borrow-collateral comparison logic

### Summary

The liquidation validation logic uses an incomplete and incorrect check in `_checkLiquidationValid`, which may allow unauthorized liquidation or reject valid ones. This occurs because the function only compares the liquidation `repayAmount` with the collateral, rather than evaluating the actual total collateral and total borrow state. As a result, the protocol may allow malicious actors to seize collateral from solvent borrowers or fail to liquidate insolvent accounts.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol: 432 _checkLiquidationValid`, the liquidation check uses `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` with `borrowAmount = payload.amount`, effectively checking whether the **borrowed + repayAmount > collateral**, which is logically incorrect. Liquidation should only be allowed if the **existing borrow exceeds the collateral**.

```solidity
function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
432    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );
    return borrowed > collateral;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower has an active position on the protocol.
2. Liquidator initiates a cross-chain liquidation.
3. `repayAmount` is a non-zero value.

### External Pre-conditions

- None required. The issue is internal to how liquidation validation is implemented.


### Attack Path

1. Borrower has a healthy collateral-to-debt ratio.
2. Liquidator initiates liquidation for a small repayAmount.
3. `_checkLiquidationValid` adds the repayAmount to the borrowed amount and compares it to collateral.
4. If the summed amount exceeds collateral, liquidation proceeds â€” incorrectly.
5. Borrower's collateral is seized even though their position was healthy.

### Impact

The borrower suffers unjustified collateral loss.  
The protocol becomes vulnerable to abusive liquidations, reducing user trust and leading to financial damage.  
This may be exploited repeatedly to grief users or manipulate system incentives.

### Mitigation

Update the `_checkLiquidationValid` logic to check against existing borrow and collateral without modifying the borrow value:
```solidity
function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
-    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );
+	(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, 0
    );
    return borrowed > collateral;
}
```
