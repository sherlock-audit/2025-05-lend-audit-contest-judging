# Flawed and Redundant Secondary Liquidity Check in borrow Function May Incorrectly Deny Valid Borrows

### Summary

After correctly invoking `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to assess the account's solvency post-borrow, the `borrow` function in `CoreRouter.sol` {root cause: performs an additional, unnecessary, and logically flawed secondary liquidity check. This secondary check incorrectly calculates a local `borrowAmount` variable by attempting to scale the account's *total* hypothetical USD debt (which already includes the new borrow amount) using market indices specific *only* to the current borrow market}. This will cause an {impact: incorrect denial of legitimate borrow requests} for {affected party: users attempting to borrow}. This occurs when {actor: a user attempts a legitimate borrow that should pass solvency checks} as {vulnerability path: the `borrow` function's primary liquidity assessment via `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` indicates sufficient liquidity, but the subsequent flawed secondary check calculates an erroneous `borrowAmount` which, when compared against the total collateral, causes its `require` statement to fail, thus blocking a valid borrow operation}. This reduces capital efficiency and creates unpredictable borrowing conditions.


### Root Cause

- In `CoreRouter.sol`, within the `borrow` function, the block of code responsible for the secondary liquidity check is flawed:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145C1-L161C72
```solidity
  // Primary (and intended) liquidity assessment:
  (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = // 'borrowed' is sumBorrowPlusEffects_after_new_borrow, 
                                          // 'collateral' is sumCollateral_before_new_borrow
      lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

  // Flawed secondary check block:
  LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken); // User's current same-chain borrow state for _lToken

  uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0 // This is a local variable for the check
      ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) // Flaw: 'borrowed' (total hypothetical debt) is misused here
      : 0;

  require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral"); // Flaw: Comparison is based on miscalculated local 'borrowAmount'
```
The primary flaw is in the calculation of the local borrowAmount variable. It incorrectly takes the borrowed parameter (which is the sumBorrowPlusEffects returned by getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral, representing the user's total USD-equivalent debt across all markets, including the current hypothetical _amount) and attempts to scale it using a ratio of borrow indices (LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex() / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) that is specific to the _lToken market. Applying a market-specific interest scaling factor to an already aggregated, USD-equivalent total hypothetical debt figure is conceptually incorrect and does not yield a meaningful value for a subsequent liquidity check. The output of getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral (borrowed and collateral parameters) is already sufficient for a direct solvency determination (i.e., collateral > borrowed).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `user` (`msg.sender`) calls the `borrow` function to borrow `_amount` of `_token` (underlying for `_lToken`).
2.  The user has sufficient overall collateral in the protocol such that the initial call to `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(user, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount)` returns `collateral_total` and `borrowed_total_after_new_op` where `collateral_total > borrowed_total_after_new_op`. This means the user *should* be permitted to borrow the `_amount` based on the protocol's comprehensive liquidity assessment function.
3.  The user has an existing same-chain borrow history in the `_lToken` market, meaning `lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(user, _lToken).borrowIndex` (let's call it `UserSnapshotIndex`) is non-zero.
4.  The current market borrow index for `_lToken` (`LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()`, let's call it `CurrentMarketIndex`) and the `borrowed_total_after_new_op` value (returned as `borrowed` by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`) are such that the flawed calculation `((borrowed_total_after_new_op * CurrentMarketIndex) / UserSnapshotIndex)` results in a local `borrowAmount` variable that is greater than `collateral_total`. (This can happen, for example, if `borrowed_total_after_new_op` is substantial due to other debts or the new `_amount`, and the ratio `CurrentMarketIndex / UserSnapshotIndex` is significant, even if `borrowed_total_after_new_op` itself is less than `collateral_total`).


### External Pre-conditions

1.  A user initiates a borrow transaction for a supported LToken market.


### Attack Path

*(This describes a failure path for a legitimate borrow operation due to the bug)*
1.  A `user` has sufficient overall collateral and liquidity to borrow `_amount` of `_token`. The call to `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(user, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount)` returns `collateral_val` (total effective collateral) and `borrowed_val_plus_new` (total debt including the new `_amount`), such that `collateral_val > borrowed_val_plus_new`. According to this primary check, the borrow should be allowed.
2.  The code then proceeds to the secondary, flawed check. It fetches `currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(user, _lToken)`. Assume `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` (user's last recorded index for this market) is `UserIdx_Old` and is non-zero.
3.  The local variable `borrowAmount_confused` is calculated as `(borrowed_val_plus_new * CurrentMarketIdx_for_lToken) / UserIdx_Old`.
4.  **Failure Scenario**: Due to the nature of this flawed calculation (e.g., if `borrowed_val_plus_new` is large relative to `collateral_val` but still less, and the index ratio `CurrentMarketIdx_for_lToken / UserIdx_Old` is also significant, or simply due to the misapplication of the formula), `borrowAmount_confused` is calculated to be greater than `collateral_val`.
    For example, if `borrowed_val_plus_new` is $900 (representing total debt including the current attempt), `collateral_val` is $1000 (so borrow should be allowed as $1000 > $900$), but `CurrentMarketIdx_for_lToken / UserIdx_Old` is 1.2, then `borrowAmount_confused` might be calculated as `$900 * 1.2 = $1080`.
5.  The check `require(collateral_val >= borrowAmount_confused, "Insufficient collateral");` is performed.
6.  In our example, this becomes `require($1000 >= $1080, "Insufficient collateral");`, which is false.
7.  The transaction reverts, and the user, who had sufficient overall liquidity for this new borrow as determined by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`, is incorrectly denied the loan due to the secondary flawed check.


### Impact

* Users possessing sufficient overall collateral and liquidity (as correctly assessed by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`) to cover a new borrow **may be incorrectly prevented from borrowing**.
* The flawed secondary liquidity check miscalculates a local `borrowAmount` variable by improperly scaling the total hypothetical debt with market-specific indices. This miscalculated value is then compared against the user's total collateral in a manner that does not accurately reflect the user's solvency post-operation.
* This can lead to **reduced capital efficiency** for users who are unfairly denied access to loans they are eligible for.
* It also results in lower utilization of the protocol's lending pools than would otherwise be safe and permissible.
* It creates **unpredictable borrowing conditions and user frustration**, as loan denials are not based on a true lack of collateral for the requested amount but on an erroneous internal calculation.
* Affected Party: Protocol users (who are denied legitimate borrows) and the LEND protocol itself (due to reduced utility and transaction volume from blocked valid operations).
