# Multiple Borrowing and Liquidation Paths Omit Cross-Chain Collateral in Solvency Checks

### Summary

The missing aggregation of cross-chain collateral in getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() will cause inaccurate solvency checks for borrowers as core protocol functions like borrowCrossChain() and liquidateBorrow() will ignore collateral supplied on other chains.

Root Cause
In LendStorage.sol:getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(), the logic only checks local userSuppliedAssets[account] and fails to aggregate collateral from getCrossChainCollaterals()

### Root Cause

IIn [`LendStorage.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L385), the function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` fails to account for `crossChainCollateral` retrieved via `getCrossChainCollaterals()`, resulting in inaccurate solvency checks.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A borrower supplies collateral on Chain A.

2. The same borrower borrows tokens on Chain B using borrowCrossChain().

3. Collateral mappings and crossChainLTokenMap are correctly registered in LendStorage.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The price oracle drops the price of the collateral on both chains.

2. Liquidation is attempted on Chain B based on apparent under-collateralization.

### Attack Path

1. Alice supplies $1000 USDC worth of collateral on Chain A.

2. Alice uses borrowCrossChain() on Chain A to borrow $600 USDT on Chain B (60% LTV).

3. Bob observes Alice's borrow state on Chain B.

4. Bob calls liquidateCrossChain() on Chain B. Chain B's call to getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() ignores Alice's cross-chain collateral.

5. Protocol treats Alice as insolvent and allows Bob to seize her collateral.

### Impact

The borrower suffers a complete or partial liquidation despite having sufficient cross-chain collateral. The liquidator unjustly seizes this collateral, leading to incorrect fund transfers. Additionally, if a borrower supplies collateral on Chain A intending to borrow on Chain B, the borrowCrossChain call will fail because Chain B observes zero collateral, causing the borrow attempt to revert. This not only blocks expected functionality but can also lead to denial of service for honest users relying on cross-chain lending.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Extend getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() to aggregate collateral from getCrossChainCollaterals().

Ensure price feeds and mappings in LendStorage are used to calculate a holistic solvency view.

Consider caching and syncing collateral views for gas efficiency.
