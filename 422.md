# Invariant Violation in `borrowWithInterest` Causes Fund Lockout

## Summary
The [borrowWithInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478) function in `LendStorage.sol` enforces an invariant that prevents both `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` mappings from being populated for the same user and underlying token on a single chain. In a cross-chain lending scenario, a user can deposit collateral on multiple chains and borrow across different chains, causing both mappings to be populated on an intermediate chain (e.g., Chain B). This violates the invariant, causing `borrowWithInterest` to always revert, which locks users out of critical protocol functions (borrowing, repaying, withdrawing, and liquidating), effectively freezing their funds indefinitely.

## Root Cause
In `LendStorage.sol`, the `borrowWithInterest` function includes the invariant `require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated")`. This assumes a user’s position for a given underlying token on a chain is either a borrow (`crossChainBorrows`) or collateral (`crossChainCollaterals`), but not both. The cross-chain lending design allows a user to use collateral on one chain (e.g., Chain A) to borrow on another (Chain B) while using local collateral on Chain B to borrow on a third chain (Chain C), populating both mappings on Chain B and breaking the invariant.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports cross-chain lending across multiple chains (e.g., Chains A, B, and C) with a common underlying token (e.g., USDC).
2. The `LendStorage` contract tracks cross-chain borrows and collaterals in `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` mappings.
3. The `borrowWithInterest` function is a dependency for critical functions like `getMaxBorrowAmount`, `getMaxRepayAmount`, `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`, and `getMaxWithdrawable`.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A user deposits USDC as collateral on multiple chains (e.g., Chains A and B).
2. The user initiates cross-chain borrows: one using collateral on Chain A to borrow on Chain B, and another using collateral on Chain B to borrow on Chain C.
3. The price oracle (`UniswapAnchoredViewInterface`) and LayerZero messaging (`CrossChainRouter.sol`) operate correctly to enable cross-chain operations.

## Attack Path
This issue arises from normal protocol usage, not a malicious attack. The following steps outline how the vulnerability manifests using the provided scenario:

1. **User Deposits Collateral**:
   - On Chain A, the user deposits 1000 USDC.
   - On Chain B, the user deposits 1000 USDC.

2. **First Cross-Chain Borrow**:
   - The user calls `borrowCrossChain` on Chain A to borrow 500 USDC on Chain B using Chain A’s collateral.
   - On Chain B, `CrossChainRouter._handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` records the borrow in `crossChainCollaterals[user][USDC]` (collateral on Chain A).
   - On Chain A, `CrossChainRouter._handleValidBorrowRequest` records the borrow in `crossChainBorrows[user][USDC]`.

3. **Second Cross-Chain Borrow**:
   - The user calls `borrowCrossChain` on Chain B to borrow 500 USDC on Chain C using Chain B’s collateral.
   - On Chain C, `CrossChainRouter._handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` records the borrow in `crossChainCollaterals[user][USDC]` (collateral on Chain B).
   - On Chain B, `CrossChainRouter._handleValidBorrowRequest` records the borrow in `crossChainBorrows[user][USDC]`.

4. **Invariant Violation on Chain B**:
   - On Chain B, both `crossChainCollaterals[user][USDC]` (from Chain A’s collateral borrow) and `crossChainBorrows[user][USDC]` (from Chain C’s borrow) are non-empty.
   - Any call to `borrowWithInterest` on Chain B (e.g., via `repayCrossChainBorrow`, `redeem`, or `liquidateBorrow`) reverts due to the violated invariant.

5. **User Lockout**:
   - The revert prevents the user from borrowing, repaying, withdrawing, or liquidating their USDC position on Chain B, effectively freezing their funds.

## Impact
- **Fund Lockout**: Users cannot withdraw collateral (`redeem` reverts via `getMaxWithdrawable`), repay borrows (`repayCrossChainBorrow` reverts via `getMaxRepayAmount`), borrow further (`borrow` reverts via `getMaxBorrowAmount`), or be liquidated (`liquidateBorrow` reverts via `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount`) on Chain B for their USDC position. This locks funds indefinitely.
- **Protocol Dysfunction**: The issue breaks core lending protocol functionalities, rendering the protocol unusable for affected users on Chain B, disrupting the ability to manage positions.
- **Indirect Losses**: Locked borrows may accrue interest indefinitely, and users may face losses from market volatility or missed opportunities, though these are indirect.
- **Sherlock Criteria** (Section III): The issue causes funds to be locked for more than a week (permanently, unless the user resolves the cross-chain conflict, which may not be feasible). Per Section IV, High severity applies for direct loss of funds without extensive limitations. While the loss is not a direct theft, the permanent lockout of funds (collateral and borrows) is equivalent to a loss of access, meeting High severity. The conditions (cross-chain deposits and borrows) are specific but feasible, not extensive.

**Reasoning for High Severity**:
- **Permanent Fund Lockout**: The revert in `borrowWithInterest` blocks all interactions with the user’s USDC position on Chain B, effectively locking collateral and borrows indefinitely. Sherlock’s criteria (Section III) consider locking funds for over a week as a High severity factor.
