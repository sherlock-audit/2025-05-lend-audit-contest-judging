# Loss of ETH Refunds in `rossChainRouter`

### Summary

In the `CrossChainRouter` contract, when cross-chain calls are made, any unused ETH from transactions that revert or use less gas than anticipated is not refunded to the user. 



### Root Cause

In the `CrossChainRouter` contract, when cross-chain calls are executed using the `_send()` function, any unused ETH (resulting from a reverted transaction or lower-than-expected gas usage) is refunded to the contract itself, as specified by payable(address(this)). 

```solidity
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

@>      _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
    }
```

This configuration means that the contract, rather than the original sender or a designated refund address, receives any ETH refunds.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The current refund mechanism in the `CrossChainRouter` contract results in any unused ETH from cross-chain transactions being retained by the contract instead of being returned directly to the user. This configuration can lead to a direct financial loss for users, as they will not automatically receive refunds for any excess ETH they provided for transaction fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function _send(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _borrowIndex,
        uint256 _collateral,
        address _sender,
        address _destlToken,
        address _liquidator,
        address _srcToken,
        ContractType ctype
    ) internal {
        bytes memory payload =
            abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

        bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0);

-       _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
+       _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(msg.sender));
    }
```
