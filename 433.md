# Borrower will loose funds if their repay transaction executes after cross-chain liquidation call

### Summary

In the current cross-chain liquidation flow, the liquidation begins on the destination chain, which sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to the source chain. The source chain seizes the user’s collateral and then sends back a `LiquidationSuccess` message. Finally, the borrow is repaid using the liquidator’s funds on the destination chain.

However, if the borrower calls `repayCrossChainBorrow` while the liquidation is in progress (after collateral has been seized but before the final repayment step), the borrow may already be repaid by the user. In this case, the final repayment using the liquidator’s funds will fail, and the `LiquidationSuccess` message will revert. Despite this, the collateral has already been seized on the source chain ,leading to an unfair loss for the borrower, who repaid their debt but still lost collateral.

### Root Cause

The cross-chain liquidation process performs the debt repayment in the final step. If a user repays their borrow during the interim (after the collateral is seized but before the repayment), the repayment attempt from the liquidator will revert. Since the collateral has already been seized, this causes an irreversible and unfair loss for the borrower.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

The borrower's repay transaction must be executed in between the cross-chain liquidation execution and the liquidation success handling.

### Attack Path

1. Alice has a $1,000 USDC cross-chain borrow on the destination chain (e.g., Chain B), and her position is near liquidation threshold.
2. Alice submits a `repayCrossChainBorrow` transaction to avoid liquidation. It enters the mempool but has not yet executed.
3. A liquidator, seeing that the position is liquidatable, sends a cross-chain liquidation transaction with higher gas fees. This executes before Alice’s repayment transaction.
4. The liquidation flow begins, and the destination chain sends a `CrossChainLiquidationExecute` message to the source chain (e.g., Chain A).
5. The source chain seizes $1,000 worth of Alice’s collateral.
6. Meanwhile, Alice’s repayment transaction executes, successfully repaying her USDC borrow.
7. The source chain sends a `LiquidationSuccess` message back to the destination chain.
8. On the destination chain, the protocol attempts to repay Alice’s borrow using the liquidator’s funds, but this fails since the borrow is already repaid.
9. The final step reverts, but Alice’s collateral has already been seized — causing a loss even though she paid her debt on time.
10. The liquidator's repayment is reverted, but the user loses collateral unjustly.

### Impact

- Borrowers can lose their collateral unfairly.


### PoC

_No code provided

### Mitigation

- Restructure the liquidation flow to repay the borrow first, before seizing collateral. This ensures that if the liquidator has already repaid the debt, borrower's repay transaction will fail.
