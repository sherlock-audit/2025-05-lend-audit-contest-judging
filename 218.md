# _checkLiquidationValid logic error can lead to malicious liquidation.

### Summary

The _checkLiquidationValid function in the CrossChainRouter.sol contract, as the last line of defense for Chain A (collateral chain) to confirm the validity of liquidation in the cross-chain liquidation process, has a logical flaw. The function incorrectly passes the payload.amount representing the "number of collateral LTokens to be seized" as the "new loan amount" parameter to the getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral function, which may lead to a misjudgment of the liquidity of the borrower's account, thereby allowing the liquidation of healthy accounts that should not be liquidated.

```solidity
    function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );
        return borrowed > collateral;
    }
```

For example, the original total borrow value of normal user A is 900 USD, and the total collateral value is 1000 USD. Malicious liquidator B attempts to liquidate A's borrow and obtain 300 USD of collateral. At this time, under the logic of _checkLiquidationValid, the 300 USD of collateral is calculated as a borrow, resulting in the total borrow value of user A being 1200 USD, while the collateral is only 1000 USD, thus causing malicious liquidation.

### Root Cause

Function _checkLiquidationValid incorrectly evaluated the borrow value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user A borrowed 900 USD and the collateral deposit was 1000 USD, which was in a healthy state.
2. Malicious liquidator B attempts to liquidate A's loan, repay 300 USD, and obtain 300 USD of collateral.
3. In the _checkLiquidationValid, 300 USD of collateral is used as a borrow, bringing the total borrow to 1200 USD, and the liquidation check is passed. User A is maliciously liquidated.

### Impact

Malicious liquidation for the health user.
