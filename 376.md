# LayerZero Executor will cause transaction failures for cross-chain lending users due to missing ordered execution option

### Summary

Missing `addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption()` in the `_send` function will cause random transaction failures for cross-chain lending users as LayerZero Executor will deliver messages out-of-order, breaking sequential operation dependencies.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol:_send()` function, the `addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption()` is missing from the LayerZero message options, violating LayerZero V2 integration requirements for sequential cross-chain operations.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L804-L822

According to the LayerZero documentation (https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/message-design-patterns#message-ordering):

> "If you do not pass an ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption in your _lzSend call, the Executor will attempt to execute the message despite your application-level nonce enforcement, leading to a message revert."

The current implementation in `_send()` only includes:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L818

But should include:

```solidity
bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions()
    .addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0)
    .addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption(); // MISSING
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Cross-chain lending protocol needs to be deployed on multiple chains with LayerZero integration
2. Users need to have collateral supplied on source chain to initiate cross-chain operations
3. Destination chain needs to have sufficient liquidity for borrowing operations

### External Pre-conditions

1. LayerZero Executor needs to be processing messages between chains with varying network latencies
2. Multiple cross-chain transactions need to be initiated in close succession to trigger out-of-order delivery
3. Network conditions need to cause different message delivery speeds across chains

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but below will showcase how the issue can manifest.

1. **User calls `borrowCrossChain()` to borrow tokens on destination chain**
2. **Function sends initial borrow message (nonce 1) via `_send()` to destination chain**
3. **Destination chain processes borrow and sends confirmation message (nonce 2) back to source chain**
4. **Due to missing ordered execution option, LayerZero Executor delivers nonce 2 before nonce 1**
5. **Source chain receives confirmation message but cannot find initial borrow record**
6. **`_handleValidBorrowRequest()` calls `findCrossChainBorrow()` which returns false**
7. **Transaction reverts, leaving user's cross-chain operation in failed state**

### Impact

Cross-chain lending users cannot reliably execute borrowing, repayment, and liquidation operations due to random message ordering failures. Users also suffer financial losses from consumed LayerZero messaging fees (contract pays `address(this).balance` as native fee) and gas costs even when transactions fail, with losses compounding through retrying failed calls. Partial cross-chain state updates can leave funds stuck in intermediate states when operations complete on one chain but fail on another. The core functions affected are:

- `borrowCrossChain()` - Initial borrow requests fail when confirmation arrives before request
- `repayCrossChainBorrow()` - Repayments fail when confirmation arrives before repayment processing
- `liquidateCrossChain()` - Liquidations fail when success message arrives before execution
- All functions using `_send()` - Every cross-chain operation is affected since all route through the same broken function

The impact affects 100% of cross-chain operations as they all depend on the single `_send()` function that lacks ordered execution, making the entire cross-chain lending protocol unreliable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the missing `addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption()` to the `_send` function's options parameter to ensure LayerZero messages are delivered and executed in the correct sequential order.

```solidity
function _send(
    uint32 _dstEid,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _borrowIndex,
    uint256 _collateral,
    address _sender,
    address _destlToken,
    address _liquidator,
    address _srcToken,
    ContractType ctype
) internal {
    bytes memory payload =
        abi.encode(_amount, _borrowIndex, _collateral, _sender, _destlToken, _liquidator, _srcToken, ctype);

    // âœ… FIXED: Added ordered execution option
    bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions()
        .addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0)
        .addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption(); @// This ensures sequential message delivery

    _lzSend(_dstEid, payload, options, MessagingFee(address(this).balance, 0), payable(address(this)));
}
```
