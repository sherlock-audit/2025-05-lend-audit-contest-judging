# Cross-chain liquidators could liquidate without any token and get a reward

### Summary

In the process of cross chain liquidation from chain B, the protocol will not lock liquidator's token but only send the amount to the source chain A. After checking all the requirements on chain A, the borrower will be liquidated directly and the reward is also sent to liquidator. After that on chain B protocol received the `LiquidationSuccess` message and then charge token from liquidator.

Here is a vulnerability because liquidator could reject the payment and run away with assests on chain A.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443C4-L471C6

Protocol will ask liquidator to repay an amount of token in the `_handleLiquidationSuccess()` function above. However, before that, on the source chain the requirements are only based on the number of the liquidation amount sent in the message. It doesn't check whether liquidator is able to repay the amount. 

Liquidators could just request a valid `liquidateCrossChain()` but reject to pay the token at the final step.

### Internal Pre-conditions

There exists a borrower borrowed cross chain and don't have enough collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1.The attacker request a valid cross chain liquidation from chain B
2.The liquidation check passes on chain A
2.The attacker don't approve any token for the crosschainrouter on chain B
3.The attacker redeem his token on chain A

### Impact

The protocol suffers loss when liquidating cross chain.
