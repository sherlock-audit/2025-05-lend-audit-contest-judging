# Cross-chain liquidation uses incorrect lToken address, preventing repayment and breaking liquidation flow

### Summary

The liquidation flow fails due to the incorrect use of the `lToken` address from Chain A when processing on Chain B. Specifically, after collateral is seized on Chain A, a message is sent back to Chain B using the Chain A version of the `lToken`, causing `findCrossChainCollateral()` to fail. This results in the borrow position not being found, and the repayment on Chain B does not proceed.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.sol: 280 _executeLiquidationCore` (on Chain B), the seized collateral is sent to Chain A using:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-sylvarithos/blob/551944cd87d138620b89c11674a92f1dcbe0efbe/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L280
```solidity
function _executeLiquidationCore(LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params) private {
    ...
    // Send message to Chain A to execute the seize
    _send(
        params.srcEid,
        seizeTokens,
        params.storedBorrowIndex,
        0,
        params.borrower,
280     lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to Chain A version before sending
        msg.sender,
        params.borrowedAsset,
        ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
    );
}
```

This correctly translates the collateral token into its Chain A version, since that's where the collateral exists.  
However, in `CrossChainRouter.sol: 445 _handleLiquidationSuccess` (on Chain B again), this same `destlToken` is used to find the borrow position:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-sylvarithos/blob/551944cd87d138620b89c11674a92f1dcbe0efbe/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L445
```solidity
function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
    // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
445    address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

    // Find the specific collateral record
    (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
        payload.sender,
        underlying,
        currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
        0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
        payload.destlToken,
        payload.srcToken
    );
```

This fails because `payload.destlToken` refers to the Chain A token address, which does not exist in Chain B's `crossChainCollaterals` mapping.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Borrower has active cross-chain borrow from Chain A collateral to Chain B borrow.
2. Liquidator initiates a liquidation on Chain B.
3. Seize token execution completes on Chain A.

### External Pre-conditions

None â€” this issue arises from internal logic inconsistency between chains.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator initiates a valid liquidation on Chain B.
2. Chain B sends a message to Chain A to seize collateral.
3. Chain A processes the seize and sends back success payload including `destlToken = Chain A version`.
4. Chain B attempts to finalize repayment using `payload.destlToken`.
5. Since this is not a valid `lToken` on Chain B, `findCrossChainCollateral()` fails.
6. Liquidation repayment is never applied; protocol state remains incorrect.

### Impact

- The liquidation repayment flow is broken.
- The borrower's borrow position remains active even though collateral has been seized.
- The protocol can become inconsistent and undercollateralized.
- Liquidators may receive seized tokens without corresponding debt reduction, leading to systemic accounting errors.

### Mitigation

In `_handleLiquidationSuccess`, should use `payload.srcToken`.

```solidity
- function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
+ function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
-   address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);
+   address lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(payload.srcToken);

    // Find the specific collateral record
    (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
        payload.sender,
-       underlying,
+       payload.srcToken
-       currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
-       0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
+       srcEid,
+       currentEid
-       payload.destlToken,
+       lToken
        payload.srcToken
    );
```
