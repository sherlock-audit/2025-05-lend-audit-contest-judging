# Local collateral can be liquidated unfairly because of cross-chain debt

### Summary

When a user is liquidated on one chain, the system checks their total debt (local + cross-chain) but only considers local collateral. This mismatch can lead to unfair liquidations. For example, users might lose their collateral even if their local position is healthy, simply because they have cross chain borrows



### Root Cause

When user created cross-chain borrow total debt is increased with `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function. And it is used by liquidation function to check if a user is undercollateralized.
The liquidateBorrow function only checks collateral and borrows on the current chain via `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. This function adds up all debts (local + cross-chain), but only includes local collateral, which creates an unfair imbalance. So even if the user has enough total collateral across all chains, they can still be liquidated unfairly on a specific chain. 

```solidity
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)
        external
    {
        // The lToken of the borrowed asset
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset);

        LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);

        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }

    function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars;

        // Calculate collateral value from supplied assets
        address[] memory suppliedAssets = userSuppliedAssets[account].values();
        address[] memory borrowedAssets = userBorrowedAssets[account].values();

        // First loop: Calculate collateral value from supplied assets
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length;) {
            //@audit local colleterals only 
...
        }

        // @audit local+cross depts included
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length;) {
            LToken asset = LToken(borrowedAssets[i]);

            // Get borrow balance for this asset
            uint256 totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(account, address(asset));

            // Add cross-chain borrows if any
            totalBorrow += borrowWithInterest(account, address(asset));

            vars.oraclePriceMantissa = UniswapAnchoredViewInterface(priceOracle).getUnderlyingPrice(asset);
            vars.oraclePrice = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissa});

            vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects =
                mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePrice, totalBorrow, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

### Internal Pre-conditions

getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral pulls all borrows including cross-chain ones.
But it only calculates local collateral from local userSuppliedAssets.
Liquidation doesn't separate local and cross-chain debt/collateral.



### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. User supplies 100 collateral on Chain A and 200 collateral on Chain B.
2. User borrows 50 locally on Chain A.
3. User also borrows 100 on Chain A through cross-chain borrow from Chain B colleteral
4. Now the system sees total debt = 150 but only local collateral = 100 (from Chain A).
5. Liquidation becomes possible on Chain A, even though the 50 local borrow is fully collateralized and 100 cross debt is collateralized from B
6. 

### Impact

Healthy cross-chain positions can be unfairly liquidated


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During liquidation, only consider local collateral and local borrow.
Exclude cross-chain borrows from this check when liquidating local debt.
