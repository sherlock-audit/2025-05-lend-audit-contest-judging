# Lack of method to withdraw protocol rewards

### Summary

The `LendStorage.sol` contract declares a mapping [protocolReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L89) to store rewards accrued to the protocol from liquidations, however, while the `CrossChainRouter`  and `CoreRouter` have logic to update and increment these rewards during liquidation events, there is no function within any of the provided contracts that allows the protocol owner or any designated address to withdraw or otherwise utilize these accrued [protocolReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L89) amounts

### Root Cause

The core issue is a design oversight: the absence of a dedicated withdrawal function for the protocolReward mapping. While funds are correctly allocated to this mapping during liquidation events (specifically, 2.8% of the liquidated amount), the lack of a corresponding withdrawal mechanism means these accumulated rewards remain inaccessible and unusable by the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User1 supplies tokens to the protocol
2. User1 borrows some tokens
3. User2 liquidates User1 as they go in debt, 2.8% of these tokens are reserved as `protocolRewards`
4. The tokens added to the `protocolRewards` mapping are not withdrawable and these tokens are locked within the contract

### Impact

The protocol is not able to use the accumulated rewards within `protocolReward` causing them a loss of funds equal to 2.8% of all the tokens liquidated within the protocol which are added to the `protocolReward` mapping.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a withdrawal method for the protocol rewards.
