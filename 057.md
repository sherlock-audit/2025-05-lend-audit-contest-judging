# Lack of ForceResume in Layer Zero Integration

### Summary

Lack of forceResumeReceive in application using LZ's interoperability standard can result in stuck transactions, halted asset transfers, and a breakdown in communication between the chains involved. Without the ability to manually resume the message flow using forceResumeReceive, these failures could lead to indefinite protocol downtime.

### Root Cause

The contracts utilizing LayerZero's interoperability standard are missing the critical implementation of ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig, which includes the forceResumeReceive function. When a message queue becomes blocked due to relayer or oracle issues, there is no way to resume the flow of messages without the forceResumeReceive function. This leaves the protocol vulnerable to indefinite downtime if the message queue cannot be unblocked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig interface implementation. No forceResumeReceive function implementation.

### External Pre-conditions

The relayer responsible for transmitting the message between Ethereum and Polygon encounters a failure or timeout.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

1. Stuck Transactions

The most direct impact of this vulnerability is that transactions across chains become stuck. Users attempting to transfer assets or interact with a dApp through LayerZero may experience indefinite delays if the message flow is interrupted and cannot be resumed.

2. Degraded User Experience

When users experience blocked cross-chain transactions, the overall trust in the protocol is diminished. Poor user experience can lead to a loss of confidence in the platform, particularly in high-volume DeFi applications, where delays can result in financial losses.

3. Security and Financial Risks

In the absence of a force resume mechanism, malicious actors may be able to exploit this vulnerability by intentionally blocking relayers or causing congestion, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Additionally, blocked transactions could result in financial losses for users and the protocol if they cannot be resolved quickly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The most critical mitigation strategy is to ensure that the forceResumeReceive function is implemented in the contract. This provides an emergency mechanism to manually unblock the message queue when necessary.

Best Practice: Developers should ensure that the contract implementing LayerZeroâ€™s messaging also integrates the ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig interface, which includes forceResumeReceive. This function should be designed to allow authorized users or the contract owner to resume the message flow in case of a failure.
