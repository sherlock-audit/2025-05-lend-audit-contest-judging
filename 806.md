# Use safeTransfer instead of transfer

### Summary

Tokens that do not comply with the ERC20 specification could return false from the transfer
function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return
value is not checked. Checking the return value is a requirement, as written in the EIP-20 specification:

"Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that
false is never returned!"

Some tokens do not return a bool (e.g. USDT, BNB, OMG) on ERC20 methods. This will make the call break,
making it impossible to use these tokens.
