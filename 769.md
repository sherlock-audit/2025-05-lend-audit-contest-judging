# Unbounded Loop in CrossChainRouter::_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest Leads to LayerZero Channel Blocking (Denial of Service)

### Summary

The `CrossChainRouter::_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function on the destination chain has an unbounded loop that iterates over a user's cross-chain collateral entries. This loop's gas consumption can grow indefinitely, leading to an out-of-gas (OOG) error during LayerZero message execution, as the `_send` function hardcodes a fixed `1,000,000` gas limit. When this occurs, LayerZero's default ordered messaging blocks the entire channel from the source to the destination. This prevents all subsequent cross-chain messages from being processed, causing a severe denial of service.

This vulnerability stems from two combined factors:

1.  **Unbounded Loop and Fixed Gas Limit:** The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function's `for` loop, iterating over `userCrossChainCollaterals`, has unbounded gas cost. The `userCrossChainCollaterals` array length is user-controlled (e.g., by supplying minimal collateral across different chains/tokens from the 5 available). This growing gas demand clashes with the hardcoded `1_000_000` gas limit set for LayerZero message execution in the `_send` function's `options`:
    ```solidity
    bytes memory options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(1_000_000, 0); //@audit why fixed gas?
    ```
    LayerZero documentation clarifies that "The LayerZero Relayer assumes only a base gas for destination contract call... It will only be enough for very simple applications. If your app requires more gas, please use the adapter parameters specified here." (Source: [LayerZero Docs: Gas Convention](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/relayer/layerzero-relayer#gas-convention)). Gas costs also vary significantly by chain (Source: [LayerZero Docs: Gas Composition](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/relayer/overview#gas-composition)). A fixed gas limit is insufficient for dynamic operations.

2.  **LayerZero's Default Blocking Mechanism:** When the unbounded loop causes an out-of-gas error on the destination chain, the LayerZero message execution fails. LayerZero's default behavior for such failures is to block the channel. As per LayerZero documentation:
    > "LayerZero provides ordered delivery of messages from a given sender to a destination chain, i.e. `srcUA -> dstChain`. ... a `STORED` message blocks the message pathway from `srcUA` to all `dstUA` on the same destination chain."
    (Source: [LayerZero Docs: Message Ordering](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/concepts/protocol/message-properties#message-ordering))

    The protocol's `_lzReceive` does not use a non-blocking pattern, allowing this default behavior to occur. As stated in LayerZero's FAQ:
    > "By default, messages will be queued if there is an out-of-gas, or logical error on the destination. ... If contract developers wish to avoid the default blocking mechanism, instead use NonblockingLzApp which will continue with the flow of messages..."
    (Source: [LayerZero Docs: Relayer FAQ](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/troubleshooting/faq#what-is-a-relayer))


### Internal Pre-conditions

* The `_send` function is used, enforcing a fixed `1_000_000` gas limit for destination chain execution.
* The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function is executed, triggering its internal `for` loop.


### External Pre-conditions

* The total gas cost required by the `for` loop (and other operations) in `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` for a specific user exceeds `1_000_000`. This occurs when `userCrossChainCollaterals.length` is sufficiently large.


### Attack Path

This vulnerability affects users in two scenarios:

1.  **Malicious Attacker:**
    * An attacker initiates multiple cross-chain borrows by calling `borrowCrossChain`, supplying minimal collateral (e.g., 1 wei) for each to create numerous unique `srcEid` and `srcToken` combinations (from the 5 available tokens across various chains). This increases the length of their `userCrossChainCollaterals` array.
    * On the destination chain, the `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function processes these, and if a new `srcEid` / `srcToken` combination is encountered, `lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral` is called, adding a new entry to the user's `userCrossChainCollaterals` array:
        ```solidity
                lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(
                    payload.sender,
                    destUnderlying,
                    LendStorage.Borrow({
                        srcEid: srcEid,
                        destEid: currentEid,
                        principle: payload.amount,
                        borrowIndex: currentBorrowIndex,
                        borrowedlToken: payload.destlToken,
                        srcToken: payload.srcToken
                    })
                );
        ```
    * After enough entries are added, the attacker initiates another cross-chain borrow. When this message is processed, the `for` loop within `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` iterates over the now excessively long `userCrossChainCollaterals` array, retrieved by:
        ```solidity
                LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCrossChainCollaterals =
                    lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(payload.sender, destUnderlying);
        ```
    * The loop consumes gas beyond the hardcoded `1_000_000` limit, causing the transaction to revert with an out-of-gas error.
    * This failed transaction becomes `STORED` by LayerZero, blocking the entire channel from the source contract to the destination chain.

2.  **Normal User (Unintentional DoS):**
    * A legitimate user naturally performs many cross-chain borrows over time, using different collaterals from various source chains and tokens.
    * As their `userCrossChainCollaterals` array grows through repeated calls to `lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral`, the gas cost for `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` eventually exceeds the `1_000_000` gas limit.
    * Subsequent cross-chain borrow attempts by this user will fail due to out-of-gas, leading to their messages being `STORED` and consequently blocking the channel, identical to the attacker scenario.

In both cases, once the channel is blocked, all future cross-chain messages originating from the source contract to that destination chain (affecting all users for all functions using this channel) are prevented from being processed until the blocked message is manually retried or cleared.


### Impact

This is a **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability. A single failed transaction, caused by the unbounded loop, can entirely halt a vital cross-chain communication channel. This leads to:

* Complete disruption of all cross-chain operations (e.g., borrows, repayments, liquidations) for affected users.
* Frozen user positions and potential liquidation risks.
* Significant manual intervention required to restore service.
* Severe erosion of user trust and confidence in the protocol's reliability.

A detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) for this vulnerability will be provided.

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, all three aspects—the unbounded loop, the fixed gas limit, and the channel blocking behavior—must be addressed:

1.  **Eliminate Unbounded Loop:**
    * Restructure the `userCrossChainCollaterals` data storage from a dynamic array to a nested mapping. This allows for O(1) (constant time) direct lookup, removing the need for iteration and its unbounded gas consumption. This would replace the `for` loop and the array fetching/adding logic with direct mapping access.

2.  **Dynamic Gas Estimation for LayerZero Messages:**
    * The fixed `1_000_000` gas limit is insufficient and dangerous. Instead of a hardcoded value, calculate and send a dynamic gas limit using LayerZero's adapter parameters. This ensures adequate gas is provided for the destination execution, accounting for varying chain costs and transaction complexity. As LayerZero docs state, "If your app requires more gas, please use the adapter parameters specified here" (Source: [LayerZero Docs: Gas Convention](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/relayer/layerzero-relayer#gas-convention)).

3.  **Implement LayerZero Non-Blocking Pattern:**
    * Adopt a non-blocking pattern for the `_lzReceive` handler. This prevents future unexpected reverts (from any source) from blocking the channel. As per LayerZero documentation, "UAs can implement a non-blocking pattern in their contract code" (Source: [LayerZero Docs: Message Ordering](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/concepts/protocol/message-properties#message-ordering)). This typically involves inheriting from `NonblockingLzApp` or implementing robust `try-catch` blocks within `_lzReceive` to handle internal reverts gracefully, ensuring the LayerZero Endpoint call itself does not revert and thus avoids channel blocking.
