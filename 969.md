# liquidators will have no incentive to liquidate small borrow positions

### Summary

Small borrow positions will not be liquidatable due to a lack of profit incentive





### Root Cause

In both the CoreRouter's `borrow` function and the CrossChainRouter's `borrowCrossChain` function, the only validation on the borrow amount is that it must be greater than zero. This means users can open borrowing positions with arbitrarily small amounts, as there is no enforced minimum borrow limit.

1. A user can borrow a very small amount.
2. If the position later becomes liquidatable (e.g., due to price movement or interest accrual), it is eligible for liquidation.
3. During liquidation, a fixed protocol fee is deducted from the seized collateral. However, for small positions, the remaining amount after the protocol fee may be too insignificant to cover the liquidatorâ€™s transaction costs (such as gas fees).
4. As a result, liquidators have little or no financial incentive to liquidate these small positions, since the cost of liquidation exceeds the potential reward. This can lead to the accumulation of unliquidated, undercollateralized positions (bad debt) in the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users can borrow without any minimum cap enforced.

### External Pre-conditions

1. User opens a very small borrow positions
2. After some time, it becomes liquidatable


### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

leaves the protocol with bad debt and can even cause the protocol to go underwater.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a minDebt check when for borrow positions
