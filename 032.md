# `borrowCrossChain` will send the borrow token on destination chain to `msg.sender` which will be problematic in case of smart wallet

### Summary
The `borrowCrossChain` function in `CrossChainRouter.sol` passes the `msg.sender` (smart wallet address) to the destination chain as the recipient of borrowed assets. This is vulnerable because the same smart wallet address could be owned by different users on different chains, leading to asset theft.

### Root Cause
The `borrowCrossChain` function passes `msg.sender` to `_send` function which is used on the destination chain to receive borrowed assets. This is problematic because smart wallet addresses (i.eERC4337) can be owned by different users on different chains.
[CrossChainRouter.sol#L148](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L148)

### Internal Pre-conditions
- None

### External Pre-conditions
- The caller is a smart wallet account (ERC4337)

### Attack Path
1. User Alice on Chain A initiates `borrowCrossChain` from smart wallet address `0x123`
2. `msg.sender` (0x123) is passed to `_send` function
3. `_send` encodes this address in the payload and sends it to destination chain
4. On destination chain, `_lzReceive` decodes the payload and calls `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`
5. `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` calls `CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain`
6. `borrowForCrossChain` transfers assets to `payload.sender` (0x123)
7. On destination chain, address `0x123` is owned by Bob
8. Bob receives the borrowed assets intended for Alice

### Impact
Complete loss of borrowed assets if such case occur.

### PoC
Nil
### Mitigation
1. Add a recipient address parameter to `borrowCrossChain`:
```solidity
function borrowCrossChain(
    uint256 _amount, 
    address _borrowToken, 
    uint32 _destEid,
    address _recipient  // New parameter
) external payable {
    // ... existing code ...
    _send(
        _destEid,
        _amount,
        0,
        collateral,
        _recipient,  // Use recipient instead of msg.sender
        destLToken,
        address(0),
        _borrowToken,
        ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
    );
}
```
