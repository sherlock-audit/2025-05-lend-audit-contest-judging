# LEND Token Stuck in CoreRouter During Distribution

## Summary:
LEND tokens intended for users may become permanently stuck in the CoreRouter contract due to an issue in the distribution process within the `claimLend` function.

## Vulnerability Detail:
The `claimLend` function first pulls all accrued LEND from the Lendtroller into the CoreRouter contract. It then iterates through a list of holders to distribute the LEND. If an error occurs during this distribution loop (e.g., transaction runs out of gas due to a large number of holders, or an unexpected revert during a transfer), the transaction will fail, but the LEND already transferred from the Lendtroller to the CoreRouter will remain in the CoreRouter's balance. There is no mechanism to recover or re-distribute this stuck LEND.

## Impact:
Users will be unable to claim their entitled LEND rewards if the distribution process fails. The stuck LEND tokens will be inaccessible, disrupting the protocol's incentive mechanism and potentially leading to user dissatisfaction. This does not directly lead to user fund loss but impacts token accessibility.

## Recommendation:
Implement a more robust LEND distribution mechanism. Consider distributing LEND directly from the Lendtroller to individual users or implementing a pull-based mechanism where users claim their LEND directly from the CoreRouter, which then pulls from the Lendtroller for only that user's amount. Alternatively, if the current push-based batching is necessary, implement error handling and a recovery mechanism for stuck LEND.
