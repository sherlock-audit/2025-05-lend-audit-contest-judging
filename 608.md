# Incorrect Liquidity Check Allowing Users to Borrow Beyond Collateral Limits

### Summary

- **File:** `CoreRouter.sol`
  - **Function:** `borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token)`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145-L190

### Severity
**High** - This vulnerability allows users to borrow more than their collateral supports, leading to undercollateralized debt positions and potential bad debt for the protocol.

### Description
The `borrow` function in `CoreRouter.sol` contains an incorrect liquidity check that compares the total collateral against only the borrow balance of the specific asset being borrowed, rather than the total borrow amount across all assets. This flaw enables users to borrow amounts that exceed their available collateral when they have existing borrows in other assets.

### Root Cause

In the `borrow` function:
- The liquidity check is performed using:
  ```solidity
  require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
  ```
- Here, `borrowAmount` is calculated as the borrow balance for the specific `_lToken` being borrowed, adjusted by the borrow index, but it does not include borrows from other assets.
- The correct check should compare the total collateral against the total borrow amount across all assets, including the new borrow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user has supplied collateral in one or more assets.
- The user has existing borrows in one or more assets.
- The user attempts to borrow additional funds from the same or different assets.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

An attacker can exploit this to create an undercollateralized debt position as follows:

### Initial Setup
- Alice supplies 2,000 DAI as collateral.
  - Assuming a collateral factor of 0.8, the collateral value is 2,000 * 0.8 = 1,600 USD.
- Alice borrows 1,000 USDC (assuming 1 USDC = 1 USD), which is within the collateral limit (1,000 < 1,600).

### Exploit Steps
1. **Second Borrow Attempt:**
   - Alice attempts to borrow an additional 500 USDC.
   - The protocol calculates:
     - `borrowed` from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`: existing borrow (1,000) + new borrow (500) = 1,500 USD.
     - `collateral`: 1,600 USD.
   - However, `borrowAmount` in the check only considers the specific asset’s borrow balance, incorrectly set to 500 (new borrow amount), and the check `collateral (1,600) >= borrowAmount (500)` passes.
2. **Result:**
   - Alice’s total borrow is 1,500 USD, but her collateral supports only up to 1,600 * 0.8 = 1,280 USD borrow limit.
   - Thus, Alice’s position is undercollateralized (1,500 > 1,280).

### Impact

- **Undercollateralization:** Users can borrow beyond their collateral limits, leading to positions where debt exceeds collateral value.
- **Bad Debt:** The protocol may incur losses during liquidation if the collateral is insufficient to cover the debt.

### PoC

Below is a runnable PoC using Solidity and Foundry to demonstrate the exploit.

### Running the PoC
1. **Steps:**
   - Save the PoC as `IncorrectLiquidityCheckPoC.sol` in a Foundry project’s `test` directory.
   - Run: `forge test --match-path test/IncorrectLiquidityCheckPoC.sol -vvvv`.
   - The test demonstrates that Alice can borrow 1,500 USDC against collateral that only supports up to 1,600 * 0.8 = 1,280 USDC, confirming the undercollateralization.

### Mitigation

Update the liquidity check to compare the total collateral against the total borrow amount, including the new borrow.

### Suggested Fix
```solidity
// Correct the liquidity check
require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```
- Here, `borrowed` should represent the total borrow amount across all assets, including the hypothetical new borrow, as returned by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`.

### Why This Works
- This ensures that the user’s total borrow does not exceed the collateral’s borrow capacity, maintaining the protocol’s collateralization requirements.
