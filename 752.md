### Attack Path

Assume that there are two (2) chains. Chain A and B.

Assume that Bob is a malicious user and he could perform the following actions to steal assets:

1. Bob adds 3 WETH as collateral in Chain A, which is worth approximately 10,000 USD in value. The LTV of WETH collateral is 90%, which means that he can borrow around 9,000 USD worth of supported assets.

2. Bob calls Chain A's `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` function to initiate a cross-chain borrowing to borrow 9,000 USDT from Chain B. This will send a `ContractType.BorrowCrossChain` LayerZero (LZ) message from Chain A to Chain B. An important point to note is that within the `ContractType.BorrowCrossChain` LayerZero (LZ) message, the collateral value will be set to 10,000 USD as shown in Line 147 below.

```solidity
File: CrossChainRouter.sol
113:     function borrowCrossChain(uint256 _amount, address _borrowToken, uint32 _destEid) external payable {
..SNIP..
143:         _send(
144:             _destEid,
145:             _amount,
146:             0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
147:             collateral,
148:             msg.sender,
149:             destLToken,
150:             address(0), // liquidator
151:             _borrowToken,
152:             ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
153:         );
154:     }
```

3. Within the same block and immediately after the `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` transaction, Bob creates and bundles a  `CoreRouter.redeem()` transaction to redeem all his collateral. As such, 3 WETH will be returned to Bob in Chain A.

4. When the Chain B router processes the incoming message, it will determine that there is sufficient collateral (10,000 collateral in the `ContractType.BorrowCrossChain` LZ message), and send 9,000 USDT to Bob, and prepare a response to be sent back to Chain A router.
5. At this point, Bob holds 9,000 USDT in Chain B and 3 WETH (worth 10,000 USD) in Chain A. He effectively stole 9,000 USDT. Bob's borrowing/debt position in Chain B is also not backed by any collateral in Chain A.

The root cause is that the `redeem()` function lacks awareness of an ongoing cross-chain borrowing that is taking place using the supplied collaterals. The supplied collateral used for the ongoing cross-chain borrowing is not ecrowed or locked, and thus the borrower can withdraw the collateral while the cross-chain borrowing is still ongoing, leading to this issue.

### Impact

Loss of assets as the attacker can steal assets as shown in the scenario above.
