### Title: BaseJumpRateModelV2::utilizationRate can revert due to division by zero when cash + borrows == reserves

Description

The function below is used to compute utilization for interest rate calculations:

```solidity
function utilizationRate(uint256 cash, uint256 borrows, uint256 reserves) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (borrows == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    return borrows * BASE / (cash + borrows - reserves);
}
```

If cash + borrows equals reserves, the denominator becomes zero, which causes the function to revert due to a division-by-zero error.

This can occur naturally during a migration, liquidation edge case, or misconfigured reserve update. It also creates a fragile dependency, as any future math relying on this breaks unexpectedly.

Impact

This bug can halt the market temporarily by breaking rate calculations.
It doesn’t steal funds, but it breaks core lending behavior — any function calling this (like getBorrowRateInternal() or getSupplyRate()) will revert.
It blocks interactions, interest accrual, and could stall liquidity movement in edge cases.


Proof of Concept

Input:

cash = 1000;
borrows = 2000;
reserves = 3000;

This results in:

util = borrows * BASE / (1000 + 2000 - 3000) = borrows * BASE / 0 → revert


Recommended Mitigation

Before dividing, check for denominator:
```solidity
uint256 denom = cash + borrows - reserves;
if (denom == 0) return 0;
return borrows * BASE / denom;
```
This way, the function safely returns 0 instead of reverting, avoiding a market freeze.
