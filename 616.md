# Protocol cant withdraw `protocolReward`

### Summary

Every time collateral is seized (e.g. during liquidation), the protocol’s share is added to `LendStorage.protocolReward` but there is no function anywhere to withdraw or claim those accumulated tokens. As a result, all protocol revenue is irretrievably locked in storage.

### Root Cause

The “protocol-reward” feature is only half-implemented:

- **Accumulation**: `LendStorage.updateProtocolReward(...)` is called in both `CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate` and `CrossChainRouter._handleLiquidationExecute`.
- **Missing withdrawal:** There is no `claimProtocolReward`, `withdrawProtocolReward`, or similar entrypoint to transfer out the stored balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Scenario

1. A user is liquidated.
2. In `CoreRouter.liquidateSeizeUpdate`, the code calculates the protocol’s seize share and calls:
```solidity
lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(
  lTokenCollateral,
  lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward
);
```
3. The `protocolReward[lTokenCollateral]` counter grows, but no function ever lets the owner or anyone withdraw those tokens from the contract.


After repeated liquidations, the protocol accumulates sizable balances of various ERC-20 assets that cannot be retrieved.

### Impact

Permanent lock-up of protocol revenue, potentially amounting to large USD sums if the protocol sees regular liquidation activity.
