# `repayAmountFinal` is deducted twice on Cross Chain Repayment.

### Summary

When a user repays a cross-chain borrow, the repayAmountFinal is inadvertently subtracted from the borrower's outstanding debt in two distinct locations within the protocol's state management. This redundant subtraction occurs both in the generic
borrow balance update (via repayBorrowInternal)
```javascript
     
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }

```
 And in the specific cross-chain collateral record update (_updateRepaymentState),
 ```javascript

        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);
            if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
                lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
            }
        } else {
            userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle = borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal;
            userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index, userCrossChainCollaterals[index]);
        }

 ```
 
This results in the borrower's debt being recorded as significantly lower than its true value.

### Root Cause

Both `repayBorrowInternal` and `_updateRepaymentState` subtracting repayAmountFinal from a borrowedAmount (which represents the current outstanding debt including interest), leading to double accounting of repaid amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

●​  A user has an active cross-chain borrow position recorded in lendStorage.userCrossChainCollaterals.
●​  The user (or a repayer) initiates a repayment for this cross-chain borrow.
● ​ The repayment amount (_amount) is less than type(uint256).max (i.e., it's a partial repayment)


### External Pre-conditions

User wants to pay a cross chain borrow

### Attack Path


**Assumptions:**

* Alice has a cross-chain loan of 1000 USDC.
    * `initial borrowPosition.principle = 1000`
    * `borrowPosition.borrowIndex = 1e18`
* Current `LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()` is `1.1e18` (due to accrued interest).
* `_getBorrowDetails` calculates `borrowedAmount` as `(1000 * 1.1e18) / 1e18 = 1100` USDC.
* Alice decides to repay 100 USDC (`_amount = 100`).

**Execution Flow:**

1.  `repayCrossChainBorrow(Alice, 100, lTokenUSDC, srcEid)` is called.
2.  `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal(Alice, msg.sender, 100, lTokenUSDC, srcEid)`:
    * `_getBorrowDetails` calculates `borrowedAmount = 1100`.
    * `repayAmountFinal = 100`.
    * Call to `_handleRepayment`:
        * `CoreRouter(coreRouter).repayCrossChainLiquidation(...)` is called.
        * This eventually calls `repayBorrowInternal(Alice, msg.sender, 100, lTokenUSDC, false)`.
        * Inside `repayBorrowInternal`:
            * `borrowedAmount` is fetched again (let's assume it's still 1100 for simplicity).
            * `lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(Alice, lTokenUSDC, 1100 - 100, ...);`
            * **Generic Debt after 1st subtraction: 1000 USDC.**
    * Call to `_updateRepaymentState`:
        * `borrowedAmount` here is the one from `_getBorrowDetails` (1100).
        * `repayAmountFinal` is 100.
        * `userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle = 1000 - 100;`
        * **Cross-chain specific principle after 2nd subtraction: 900 USDC.**
        * This principle is then used to `lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral`.

**Result:**

* Alice has repaid 100 USDC.
* Her true outstanding debt should be 1000 USDC (`1100 - 100`).
* However, the protocol's generic borrow balance is updated by subtracting the repayment once in `repayBorrowInternal`. Additionally, the cross-chain specific principle is also reduced by the repayment amount in `_updateRepaymentState`. This leads to a double accounting of the repayment.

**Conclusion:**

The protocol's generic borrow balance might show 1000 USDC, while the cross-chain specific principle for that borrow is also updated to 900. This effectively reduces the recorded debt by 200 USDC (100 from `repayBorrowInternal` and 100 from `_updateRepaymentState`). This means the protocol incorrectly believes Alice owes 900 USDC when she actually owes 1000 USDC.

### Impact

protocol effectively loses a portion of the repaid amount because it's no longer accounted for as outstanding debt.
