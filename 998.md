# Precision Loss in Liquidity Calculations

### Summary

getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral loses precision, miscalculating borrow limits and enabling over-borrowing

### Root Cause

Code Mistake: In LendStorage.sol:374â€“451, sequential multiplications/divisions (vars.tokensToDenom = mul_(mul_(vars.collateralFactor, vars.exchangeRate), vars.oraclePrice)) without precision management cause rounding errors.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to support tokens with low decimals (e.g., 2 decimals).

2. Attacker needs to supply low-decimal tokens as collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker supplies a low-decimal token to CoreRouter::supply.

2. Precision loss inflates borrow limit in getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral.

3. Attacker borrows beyond safe limits via CoreRouter::borrow.

### Impact

Protocol loses excess borrowed funds while attacker gains them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a decimal check:

```solidity
require(IERC20Metadata(token).decimals() >= 6, "Too few decimals");
```
