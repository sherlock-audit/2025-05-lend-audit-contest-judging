# Admin Cannot Claim LEND Rewards Accrued from Protocol-Owned lTokens

### Summary

During liquidations, 2.8% of the seized lTokens are allocated to the protocol as rewards. These are recorded in the `protocolReward` mapping. However, while LEND reward tracking is implemented for individual users who supply or borrow through `distributeSupplierLend` and `distributeBorrowerLend`, there is no corresponding mechanism to track or distribute LEND rewards accrued on the protocol-owned lTokens. As a result, all LEND rewards accrued for the protocol-owned lTokens become permanently stuck in the `CoreRouter` contract.

```solidity
// liquidateSeizeUpdate in CoreRouter.sol
uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));
// @audit-issue These protocol-held lTokens do not have any LEND reward accounting.
lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
```

### Root Cause

LEND rewards accrued on protocol-owned lTokens (stored in `protocolReward`) are never tracked or distributed to the protocol owner.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This is not an exploit but a protocol design flaw:
1. A user is liquidated.
2. The liquidator seizes 1000 lTokens, of which 2.8% (28 lTokens) are allocated to the protocol.
3. These lTokens accrue LEND rewards over time.
4. Since there is no reward accounting for the protocol-owned lTokens, the corresponding LEND rewards remain stuck.

### Impact

The protocol permanently loses access to all LEND rewards accrued from lTokens it owns due to liquidations. These rewards accumulate in the `CoreRouter` contract but cannot be claimed and will stuck forever in the Router.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce LEND reward accounting for protocol-owned lTokens by treating the protocol as a virtual supplier. Ensure `distributeSupplierLend` is invoked for that virtual supplier whenever `protocolReward` is updated.
