# M-02 Missing Zero Address Check in Setter Allows Invalid Router Assignment

### [M-02] Missing Zero Address Check in Setter Allows Invalid Router Assignment

**Description:** 
The `CoreRouter::setCrossChainRouter` function allows the contract owner to set the `crossChainRouter` address without validating that the input is non-zero. Assigning the zero address could break cross-chain functionality or allow denial-of-service by disabling cross-chain operations.

LOC: `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L52`

**Impact:**  
- If the zero address is set as the `crossChainRouter`, any function that relies on this address (such as `borrowForCrossChain`) will revert or malfunction.
- This could result in a denial-of-service for all cross-chain borrowing and repayment, impacting protocol usability and reliability.

**Proof of Concept:**

```solidity
function setCrossChainRouter(address _crossChainRouter) external onlyOwner {

@> crossChainRouter = _crossChainRouter;

}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Add a zero address check to the setter function:

```solidity
function setCrossChainRouter(address _crossChainRouter) external onlyOwner {
    require(_crossChainRouter != address(0), "Invalid crossChainRouter");
    crossChainRouter = _crossChainRouter;
    emit CrossChainRouterSet(_crossChainRouter); // Also emit an event for transparency
}
```
