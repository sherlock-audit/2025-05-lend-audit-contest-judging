# Invariant check will cause complete denial of service for borrowers when users perform bidirectional cross-chain operations

### Summary

The overly restrictive invariant check in `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest()` will cause a complete denial of service for borrowerswhen a user performs bidirectional cross-chain operations, preventing liquidations and other users operations causing protocol insolvency.

### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol:485` the invariant check `require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated")` incorrectly assumes that both `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` cannot be populated simultaneously for the same user and token on a single chain.

However, there is nothing that prevents a user to perform bidirectional cross-chain operations for a same token. This invariant check will revert after a user performs bidirectional cross-chain borrows in any operation that uses `borrowWithInterest()` such as repayments and `distributeBorrowerLend()` and `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` which is used also to redeem assets.

### Attack Path

1. **User supplies 2000 USDC on Chain A and borrows 1000 DAI cross-chain from Chain A to Chain B, populating `crossChainBorrows[user][DAI]` on Chain A**
2. **User supplies 2000 ETH on Chain B and borrows 1000 DAI cross-chain from Chain B to Chain A, populating `crossChainCollaterals[user][DAI]` on Chain A**
3. **Token prices fluctuate making the user undercollateralized on Chain A**
4. **Liquidator attempts to liquidate the user's DAI position on Chain A by calling liquidation functions**
5. **The liquidation calls `getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` which calls `borrowWithInterest()` for DAI**
6. **The function reverts due to the invariant check since both `crossChainBorrows[user][DAI]` and `crossChainCollaterals[user][DAI]` have elements on Chain A**
7. **User attempts to repay their own position calling `getMaxRepayAmount()` which also reverts**

### Impact

The protocol suffers complete loss of liquidation mechanism for cross-chain positions when users perform bidirectional cross-chain operations. Undercollateralized positions cannot be liquidated, leading to bad debt accumulation and potential protocol insolvency. Users cannot repay their own cross-chain borrows, permanently locking their collateral and breaking core protocol functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the invariant check and modify the function to handle both arrays simultaneously by combining the borrowed amounts from both `crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals`.
