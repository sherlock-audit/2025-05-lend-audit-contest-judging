# Stale Exchange Rate Used in `CoreRouter::supply()` Causes Incorrect Mint Token Accounting

### Summary

The [supply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L56-L92) function calculates minted `lTokens` using a stale exchange rate retrieved before interest accrual, while the actual mint operation uses a potentially updated rate after accrual. This discrepancy creates phantom tokens in protocol accounting, leading to systemic insolvency risk, user fund loss, and protocol collapse.


### Root Cause

The core issue stems from the improper separation of exchange rate retrieval and state-changing operations:

- [exchangeRateStored()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L276-L309) returns rate without accruing interest

- [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L379-L447) internally accrues interest before calculating tokens

- Protocol uses pre-mint rate for accounting, while mint uses post-accrual rate


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `CoreRouter::supply()` uses `exchangeRateStored()` before calling `LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint()`.

2. The `mint()` call internally triggers `accrueInterest()`, updating the exchange rate.

3. `CoreRouter` calculates `mintTokens` after minting using the pre-accrued (stale) exchange rate.

4. The minted token count recorded in `LendStorage::updateTotalInvestment()` is based on this outdated exchange rate.

5. `LendStorage` trusts this `mintTokens` value for further accounting (e.g., user balances, rewards, liquidity).

6. No secondary source (like actual minted return value from `mint()`) is used to verify the correct amount.

7. No post-mint reconciliation or assertion is performed to align `CoreRouter` and `LToken` states.


### External Pre-conditions

1. There is `borrow` activity in the market, causing `accrueInterest()` to increase `exchangeRate` significantly over time.

2. No recent user interactions have called `mint(), redeem()`, or `exchangeRateCurrent()`, so `exchangeRateStored()` is stale.

3. High volatility in utilization rate causes frequent interest rate changes, increasing delta between `exchangeRateStored()` and `exchangeRateCurrent()`.

4. User supply large amounts `(_amount)` during such a stale period, exaggerating the discrepancy.

5. Other parts of the system (rewards, liquidity checks, dashboards) rely on the miscalculated value stored in `LendStorage`.


### Attack Path

Assumption:
- The market has non-zero utilization, and borrowers are active.

- The `exchangeRateStored()` becomes outdated due to idle time or lack of interactions.

Step-by-step Attack Path:

1. Block N: A user borrows a large amount from the protocol, increasing `totalBorrows`.

2. No one interacts with the protocol after the borrow. `accrualBlockNumber` becomes stale, and so does `exchangeRateStored()`.

3. Block N+X: Attacker calls `CoreRouter.supply(_amount, _token)`:
- Reads stale `exchangeRateStored()` (too low).
- Calls `LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount)` â€” this accrues interest, updating `exchangeRate`.
- But attacker calculates minted tokens with the old rate, inflating the value.

4. CoreRouter then updates `LendStorage::updateTotalInvestment()` using this overestimated value

5. User balance is overrepresented:

- May receive more rewards.
- May evade liquidation if used as collateral.
- May even redeem at a higher rate later if `redeem()` logic doesn't validate against actual `lToken` balance.

### Impact

- User has more `totalInvestment` than truly minted
- Overpayment of LEND tokens via `distributeSupplierLend()`
- Can borrow more than allowed (due to inflated balance)
- Underestimates user's risk; may avoid rightful liquidation
- Misaligned, possibly reducing protocol earnings and security

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ... [previous logic]
    
    // Measure actual token balance change
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
    uint256 actualMintedTokens = IERC20(_lToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;

    // Use ACTUAL minted tokens for storage
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
        msg.sender, _lToken, lendStorage.totalInvestment(msg.sender, _lToken) + actualMintedTokens
    );
    
    // ... [remaining logic]
}
```
