# Possible redemption of `lTokens` for the corresponding `collateralToken` that is used in cross chain borrowing.

### Summary

Users can redeem `lTokens` to retrieve the corresponding `collateralToken` used in cross-chain borrowing. This means the necessary amount of `collateralToken` for a cross-chain loan is not permanently locked till repayment or liquidation and remains redeemable.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of an additional sanity check during redemption (`CoreRouter.redeem()`) to verify that all cross-chain borrows associated with the specific `lToken` have sufficient collateral maintained on the current chain and in that `lToken`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User supplies tokenA1 = 100 units and tokenA2 = 100 units on chain A (source chain).
2. lTokenA1 is mapped to token TokenA1 and vice-versa.
3. lTokenA2 is mapped to TokenA2 and vice-versa.
4. On destination chain B, lTokenB is mapped to TokenB and vice-versa.
5. Also, on chain A, lTokenB is mapped to TokenA1 (underlyingToDestlToken).
6. Assuming collateral factor and exchangeRate of 1 or 1e18.
7. User takes a cross chain loan of TokenB = 100 units depositing collateral of lTokenA1.
8. User redeems lTokenA1.

### Impact

This attack path allows the user to bypass collateral requirements and effectively steal funds. By redeeming lTokenA1 after using it as collateral for a cross-chain loan, the user retrieves the original collateral while still holding the borrowed TokenB on chain B. This results in:

Unsecured Loan: The cross-chain loan of 100 units of TokenB remains active without any valid collateral backing it.

Protocol Loss: The protocol incurs a loss equivalent to the value of the borrowed TokenB (100 units in this case), as it cannot liquidate the redeemed collateral.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a cross-chain collateral sanity check during the `lToken` redemption process.
