# Improper LendStorage.LiquidationParams Struct Mutation Leading to Incorrect Liquidation Execution

### Summary

In the liquidateCrossChain flow, the code initializes a LendStorage.LiquidationParams struct and mutates its fields in _validateAndPrepareLiquidation. However, this struct is passed by value (in memory) to internal functions, and Solidity’s memory semantics mean changes in one function do not persist to the caller. This results in critical fields (storedBorrowIndex, borrowPrinciple) being unset or incorrect during subsequent liquidation steps, which can:

Lead to division by zero errors.

Cause incorrect max liquidation calculations.

Result in seizure of incorrect amounts of collateral.

Break cross-chain repayment and liquidation flows.

### Root Cause

In liquidateCrossChain, the LendStorage.LiquidationParams struct is initialized and passed by value (in memory) to _validateAndPrepareLiquidation, which populates critical fields (storedBorrowIndex, borrowPrinciple).

Due to Solidity’s memory semantics, these updates do not persist back to the original params in the caller context, and the subsequent calls to _prepareLiquidationValues and _executeLiquidationCore operate on the original (unmodified) values.

// In crossChainLiquidation.sol:
LendStorage.LiquidationParams memory params = ...;
_validateAndPrepareLiquidation(params);  // Updates are not persisted!
_executeLiquidation(params);             // Proceeds with stale params

### Internal Pre-conditions

Liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain with valid parameters for a cross-chain liquidation.

The targeted borrower has a valid borrow position stored in lendStorage, with a non-zero storedBorrowIndex and borrowPrinciple.

The _validateAndPrepareLiquidation function is called with these parameters but its updates to the struct are not returned to the caller.

### External Pre-conditions

LToken borrowIndex for the borrower's loan is updated (accrued interest).

The cross-chain context involves at least one different chain (source and target chain IDs differ).

### Attack Path

The liquidator calls liquidateCrossChain and provides parameters for a valid liquidation.

The system calls _validateAndPrepareLiquidation(params) which:

Finds the borrower’s collateral.

Sets params.storedBorrowIndex and params.borrowPrinciple.

These updates are not returned to the caller, and the original params (with zeroed fields) continues to _prepareLiquidationValues.

_prepareLiquidationValues calculates:

currentBorrow = (params.borrowPrinciple * currentBorrowIndex) / params.storedBorrowIndex;

If storedBorrowIndex == 0, this causes division by zero.

If borrowPrinciple == 0, it underestimates borrow value, allowing an attacker to liquidate too little collateral or none at all.

_executeLiquidationCore proceeds to seize incorrect or zero collateral and sends cross-chain messages with incorrect liquidation data.

### Impact

Severe: This breaks cross-chain liquidation, potentially allowing:

Failed liquidations (reverting transactions).

Incorrect seizure amounts.

Undetected liquidation eligibility.

Incorrect repayment calculations, harming protocol accounting.

High risk for protocols using cross-chain lending, especially if borrowed positions accumulate high value.

### Mitigation

✅ Option 1 (Best Practice):

Return the updated params from _validateAndPrepareLiquidation.

params = _validateAndPrepareLiquidation(params);
