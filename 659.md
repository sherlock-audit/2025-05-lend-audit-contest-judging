# Stale Collateral Data in Cross-Chain Borrow Validation (_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest) Leads to Risk of Undercollateralized Loans

### Summary

The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function in `CrossChainRouter.sol` on the destination/debt chain (Chain B) {root cause: validates a new cross-chain borrow against a `payload.collateral` value that was calculated on the source/collateral chain (Chain A) at a potentially significantly earlier time}. This will cause an {impact: approval of undercollateralized loans, leading to bad debt risk} for {affected party: the LEND protocol}. This occurs as {actor: a user, potentially malicious or acting under normal race conditions/market volatility} will {vulnerability path: initiate a cross-chain borrow on Chain A, which sends their then-current collateral value (`payload.collateral`) to Chain B. If, during the LayerZero message transit time, the user's actual collateral value on Chain A decreases (due to price drops or other actions by the user on Chain A like withdrawing collateral), Chain B will still approve the borrow based on the outdated, higher `payload.collateral` value, even if the new loan makes the user's system-wide position undercollateralized with respect to their *current* collateral value on Chain A}.


### Root Cause

- In `CrossChainRouter.sol`, within the `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function (executed on the destination/debt chain, Chain B):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L621-L622
```solidity
  // payload.collateral is the total USD effective collateral value of the borrower on Chain A,
  // calculated at the time the borrowCrossChain message was initiated on Chain A.
  (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
      payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
  );
  // totalBorrowed is the borrower's total USD debt on Chain B *after* including the new payload.amount.

  require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral"); // Vulnerable Check
```
The `require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");` check uses `payload.collateral`. This value represents the borrower's collateralization status on the source chain (Chain A) at the time the cross-chain borrow request was initiated on Chain A. Due to the asynchronous nature of LayerZero messaging and potential network latency, there can be a delay between when `payload.collateral` was calculated on Chain A and when this check is performed on Chain B. During this delay, the actual value of the borrower's collateral on Chain A might have decreased (e.g., due to market price drops of their collateral assets, or the borrower performing other operations on Chain A such as withdrawing some of that collateral). The check on Chain B does not re-verify or use a fresh collateral value from Chain A at the time of borrow execution on Chain B.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `borrower` (identified as `payload.sender`) has collateral deposited on a source chain (Chain A, identified by `srcEid` in the `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` parameters, which is `_origin.srcEid` in `_lzReceive`).
2.  The `borrower` initiates a cross-chain borrow by calling `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain` on Chain A.
3.  Inside `borrowCrossChain` on Chain A, the borrower's current total effective collateral value on Chain A is calculated (e.g., `$C_A_t1`) and included as `payload.collateral` in the LayerZero message sent to the destination chain (Chain B).
4.  The LayerZero message is received by `CrossChainRouter._lzReceive` on Chain B, which then calls `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` with the received `payload` and `srcEid` (Chain A's EID).


### External Pre-conditions

1.  There is a non-zero delay (`t_delay`) between the calculation of `payload.collateral` on Chain A (at time `t1`) and the execution of the `require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, ...)` check within `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` on Chain B (at time `t2 = t1 + t_delay`). This delay is inherent in cross-chain messaging.
2.  During this `t_delay`, one or more of the following occurs on Chain A, reducing the actual value of the `borrower`'s collateral on Chain A:
    * The market price of the assets constituting the `borrower`'s collateral on Chain A decreases.
    * The `borrower` performs operations on Chain A that reduce their effective collateral (e.g., withdraws some collateral, takes on new same-chain debt against that collateral).
3.  As a result, at time `t2`, the borrower's *actual* current total effective collateral value on Chain A (let's call it `$C_A_t2`) is less than the `payload.collateral` value (`$C_A_t1`) sent in the message (i.e., `$C_A_t2 < payload.collateral`).


### Attack Path

1.  A `borrower` on Chain A has an effective collateral value of `$1000` (this becomes `payload.collateral`). They initiate a `borrowCrossChain` request on Chain A to borrow `$800` worth of assets on Chain B. The LayerZero message containing `payload.collateral = 1000` and `payload.amount = 800` is sent from Chain A to Chain B.
2.  While the LayerZero message is in transit (or before it's processed on Chain B), the `borrower`'s actual effective collateral value on Chain A drops to `$700`. This could be due to:
    * A significant price drop of their collateral assets on Chain A.
    * The `borrower` quickly withdrawing `$300` worth of their collateral on Chain A after the `borrowCrossChain` transaction on Chain A confirmed but before the message is processed on Chain B.
3.  The LayerZero message arrives on Chain B, and `CrossChainRouter._handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` is executed with `payload.collateral = 1000` and `payload.amount = 800`.
4.  Inside `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` on Chain B:
    a.  `LTokenInterface(payload.destlToken).accrueInterest()` is called.
    b.  `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...)` is called to calculate `totalBorrowed` on Chain B if `payload.amount = 800` is borrowed. Assume for this example that the `borrower` has no prior debt on Chain B, so `totalBorrowed` becomes `$800` (plus any infinitesimal interest accrued on other positions, if any, which we ignore for simplicity here).
    c.  The check `require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");` is performed.
    d.  This becomes `require(1000 >= 800, "Insufficient collateral");` which evaluates to `true`.
5.  The borrow of `$800` on Chain B is approved and executed via `CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(...)`.
6.  The `borrower` successfully receives `$800` on Chain B.
7.  However, at this point, the `borrower`'s actual system-wide position is: Collateral on Chain A = `$700`, Debt on Chain B = `$800`. The position is now undercollateralized by `$100`.
8.  The protocol on Chain A will eventually be notified via `_handleValidBorrowRequest` and will record a cross-chain borrow based on the `$800` amount, but its local view of collateral might still be the original higher amount until a full re-evaluation of that collateral happens (e.g., during a subsequent operation by the user on Chain A or a liquidation check initiated on Chain A). The critical issue is that the loan on Chain B was approved based on stale data.


### Impact

* The LEND protocol is at **risk of issuing undercollateralized cross-chain loans**. When the destination chain (Chain B) approves a borrow based on stale collateral information from the source chain (Chain A), the borrower's actual current collateral on Chain A might no longer be sufficient to cover the new total system-wide debt.
* This can lead to **bad debt accumulation** for the protocol if these undercollateralized positions cannot be successfully liquidated in time (e.g., if the collateral value on Chain A continues to drop before Chain A's state reflects the new cross-chain debt and a liquidation can be triggered there).
* The affected party is the LEND protocol, as its solvency is threatened by unrecoverable loans.


### PoC

Addressing TOCTOU in cross-chain systems is inherently complex. Potential mitigations involve trade-offs:
1.  **Stricter Collateralization Ratios for Cross-Chain Borrows**: Impose significantly higher collateral requirements (lower LTVs / higher collateral factors) specifically for cross-chain operations to create a larger buffer against stale data. This reduces capital efficiency.
2.  **Collateral Locking/Escrow on Source Chain**: When a `borrowCrossChain` request is initiated on Chain A, Chain A's `CrossChainRouter` could attempt to "lock" or "earmark" the portion of collateral (`payload.collateral` or a fraction of it based on the requested borrow amount) that is intended to back the cross-chain loan. This lock would only be released once Chain A receives confirmation from Chain B that the loan was either finalized (and a corresponding debt recorded on Chain A) or rejected/timed out. This adds complexity to Chain A's logic.
3.  **Frequent State Sync / Collateral Value Attestation**: Implement a mechanism for Chain B to request a fresh collateral value attestation from Chain A immediately before approving the borrow. This would involve another round of LayerZero messaging, increasing latency and cost but providing more up-to-date information.
4.  **Rely on Faster Cross-Chain Messaging & Shorter Delays**: If LayerZero or the specific configuration used can guarantee very low message delivery times, the window for stale data issues narrows, but it never fully disappears.
5.  **Introduce a "Cool-down" or "Challenge" Period on Chain B**: After receiving the borrow request but before disbursing funds, Chain B could wait for a short period during which Chain A could send an "abort" message if the collateral significantly degraded. This is complex and adds user friction.
6.  **Accept the Risk with Robust Liquidation**: If the protocol relies heavily on fast and efficient cross-chain liquidations, it might accept a certain level of risk from stale data, assuming liquidators can quickly act once the full state (debt on B, updated collateral on A) is eventually consistent and a shortfall is apparent. This is risky.

A common approach is a combination of stricter collateral factors for cross-chain operations and ensuring the cross-chain liquidation mechanism is as robust and timely as possible. Locking collateral on the source chain (Mitigation 2) provides the strongest guarantee but is also the most complex to implement correctly.
