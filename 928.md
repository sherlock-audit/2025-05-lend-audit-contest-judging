# No incentive to liquidate small positions



## Description
Liquidators liquidate users for the profit they can make. If there is no profit to be made than there will be no one to call the liquidate function. For example an account has 6$ worth of collateral. This user is undercollateralized and must be liquidated in order to ensure that the protocol remains overcollateralized. Because the value of the account is so low, after gas costs, liquidators will not make a profit liquidating this user. In the end these low value accounts will never get liquidating, leaving the protocol with bad debt and can even cause the protocol to be undercollateralized with enough small value accounts being underwater.

## Impact

The protocol can be undercollateralized potentially not allowing users/owners/liquidators to redeem their collateral by any means, complete loss of funds.

## Recommendation
An small percentage of the liquidated funds should be given to the liquidator as incentive
