# Unbounded Loops in claimLend Function of CoreRouter

### Summary

The claimLend function in CoreRouter.sol contains nested loops that iterate over the holders and lTokens arrays without any restrictions on their sizes. This can lead to excessive gas consumption, potentially causing transactions to fail if the arrays are large enough to exceed the block gas limit.

### Root Cause

In CoreRouter.sol, the claimLend function processes arrays of holders and lTokens without enforcing any upper limit on their sizes. The function includes nested loops that iterate over these arrays, performing operations such as distributing LEND tokens to borrowers and suppliers. Each iteration involves state reads and writes, which are gas-intensive operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol must have a significant number of holders or lTokens, or a caller must provide large input arrays.
The gas limit of the block must be insufficient to handle the gas required for large loops.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

A user or attacker calls claimLend with large holders and lTokens arrays.
The nested loops in claimLend consume excessive gas due to the large array sizes.
The transaction fails due to exceeding the block gas limit, preventing reward claims.

### Impact

If the holders or lTokens arrays are large, the gas required to execute the loops can exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. This prevents users from claiming their LEND tokens, leading to potential loss of rewards and user dissatisfaction.

            lTokens[i] = LToken(address(uint160(i + 1000)));
        }      
        uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
        coreRouter.claimLend(holders, lTokens, true, true);
        uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
        emit log_named_uint("Gas used", gasUsed);
    }
}

### Mitigation

Implement size limits for the holders and lTokens arrays.
require(holders.length <= 100, "Too many holders");
require(lTokens.length <= 10, "Too many lTokens");
