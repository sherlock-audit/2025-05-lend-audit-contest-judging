# In the supply function, not using the latest exchangeRate results in an error in the protocol ledger

### Summary

In the supply function, not using the latest exchangeRate results in an error in the protocol ledger. The user's total balance and the actual lToken balance cannot be corresponded.

When calculating minttokens, the obtained mintTokens are larger because exchangeRateBefore is smaller.
```solidity
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
```
However, LEND does not get the number of mintTokens from compound, resulting in insufficient amount of ltokens when redeeming.
As you can see, compound is called [accrueInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L385) for updates when mint.
```solidity
    function mintInternal(uint256 mintAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        accrueInterest();
        // mintFresh emits the actual Mint event if successful and logs on errors, so we don't need to
        mintFresh(msg.sender, mintAmount);
    }
```

### Root Cause

In the [supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74) function, the latest exchangeRate is not used

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The exchangeRate has been changed, but it has not been updated in the contract.
2. When the user makes a supply, the totalInvestment will store the wrong data.
3. The user makes a redeem and can't take out the funds because there is not enough ltoken for LEND

### Impact

Incorrect records can damage the entire ledger and cause losses to some users. Even redeem may revert.
