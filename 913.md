# `_handleValidBorrowRequest` does not scale the previous borrow amount using the current index

### Summary

The `CrossChainRouter::_handleValidBorrowRequest` function updates the user's cross chain borrow, but fails to scale up the previous borrow amount (if the user has existing loan already) before adding up a new loan amount.  Instead it is scaled during the execution of `_getBorrowDetails`. This is quite problamatic because `_getBorrowDetails` is executed during `repayCrossChainBorrowInternal`. At this point the amount being scaled is a cummulative amount which might have been borrowed at different indexes. So the entire scaled amount will be more than the true amount to be paid back by the user

```solidity
    function _handleValidBorrowRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        // Find the specific borrow record using the new helper
        (bool found, uint256 index) =
            lendStorage.findCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, srcEid, currentEid, payload.destlToken);

        if (found) {
            // Update existing borrow
            LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userBorrows = lendStorage.getCrossChainBorrows(payload.sender, payload.srcToken);
            //@audit no scaling
@>>         userBorrows[index].principle = userBorrows[index].principle + payload.amount;
            userBorrows[index].borrowIndex = payload.borrowIndex;

            // Update in storage
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainBorrow(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, index, userBorrows[index]);
        } else {
            // Add new borrow record
            lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
                payload.sender,
                payload.srcToken,
                LendStorage.Borrow(
                    srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
                )
            );
        }

        lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(payload.sender, lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(payload.srcToken));

        // Emit BorrowSuccess event
        emit BorrowSuccess(payload.sender, payload.srcToken, payload.amount);
    }
```
This bug limits the repayment amount to the amount calculated by the `_getBorrowDetails` during repay. Making the user pay more than they actually should, if their tokens were scaled properly at each intervals. 
### Root Cause

Failure to scale user debt (using the current index) before adding new debt

### Internal Pre-conditions

User borrows same token across multiple different indices

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User borrows token cross chain multiple times
2. Each Validation transaction does not upscale the amount to the cureent amount they owe before adding new amount
3. User ends up paying more (the amount calculated by `_getBorrowDetails`)

### Impact

Loss of funds for the user

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Scale the borrow amount using the current index
