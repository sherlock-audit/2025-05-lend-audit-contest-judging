# CoreRouter and CrossChainRouter lacks implementation for nativeETH

### Summary

The Protocol README says:

```bash
If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

Whitelisted only (e.g BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, USDT). ERC20 standard.
```

but none of the routers i.e `CoreRouter.sol` and `CrossChainRouter.sol` implements a functionality for native eth transfers in any of their basic operations i.e

1. Supply
2. Borrow
3. Liquidate
4. Redeem 
5. RepayBorrow

You can see the router's here :

[CoreRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L20)

[CrossChainRouter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L23)


We don't have any eth specific implementation including underlying low level calls for transfer to protocol and users.

`A payable modifier is required in order to accept eth in solidity.`

This breaks a core protocol functionality.

Users cannot send in eth if they wan't to. 

The Protocol has a `receive()` function to receive eth directly but no way to receive it through the fundamental operations which is the main intended use of the protocol.


### Root Cause

- Lack of native ETH specific implementation in the functions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None, it's a logical error.

### External Pre-conditions

- None, it's a logical error.

### Attack Path

- None, it's a logical error.

### Impact

- Breaks a core protocol functionality/Implementation.
- If a user tries to send in native eth he/she can't.
- High Severity and Impact.

### PoC

- 

### Mitigation

1. ETH Detection Logic: Check if _token == address(0) or ETH constant
2. Conditional Transfer Logic: Use msg.value for ETH, transferFrom for ERC20
3. Payable Functions: Make supply() and repayBorrow() payable
4. ETH Withdrawal: Use .call{value: amount}("") for ETH transfers out
5. Balance Tracking: Handle ETH balance separately from ERC20 accounting
