# Double Interest Calculation Causes Overly Restrictive Borrowing

### Summary

Incorrect application of borrow index calculation to a value that already includes interest will cause borrowing restrictions for users as borrowers will be required to provide significantly more collateral than mathematically necessary due to double-counting of accrued interest.

### Root Cause

In [CoreRouter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157-L159) the borrow validation applies borrow index interest calculation to the `borrowed` variable which already contains accrued interest and new borrow amounts in USD terms:

```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;
```

The `borrowed` variable comes from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` which already calculates existing borrows with accrued interest using `borrowWithInterestSame()` and adds the new borrow amount. Applying the borrow index formula again results in double-counting interest.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an existing borrow position with `currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0`
2. Time needs to pass allowing interest to accrue on the existing borrow (current borrow index > original borrow index)
3. User needs to attempt a second borrow on the same asset

### External Pre-conditions

1. Interest rates need to be positive to cause borrow index appreciation over time
2. Sufficient time needs to pass for meaningful interest accrual (borrow index increase)

### Attack Path

This is not an attack path but a user impact scenario:

1. User supplies collateral and borrows tokens initially
2. Time passes and interest accrues on the borrow position (borrow index increases)
3. User attempts to borrow additional tokens of the same asset
4. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` correctly calculates total borrowed amount including interest
5. The buggy formula applies interest calculation again to this already-correct value
6. User's borrow is rejected due to artificially inflated borrow amount calculation
7. User cannot access funds they should mathematically be able to borrow

### Impact

Users cannot execute valid borrows when they have sufficient collateral due to the interest double-counting bug. This creates an overly restrictive lending protocol that unnecessarily limits user access to funds.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the incorrect borrow index calculation and use the `borrowed` value directly from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`:
