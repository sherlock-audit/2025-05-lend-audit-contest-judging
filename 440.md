# Missing `accrueInterest` in `redeem` function

## Summary
The absence of `accrueInterest()` before calling `exchangeRateStored()` in the CoreRouter `redeem` function will cause an approximate loss of underlying tokens for users as the Router contract will receive more tokens from the lToken than it transfers to the user.

[CoreRouter.redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L100-L100)

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol`, the `exchangeRateStored()` is called without invoking `accrueInterest()` on the lToken, leading to an outdated exchange rate being used to calculate the expected underlying tokens.


## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The borrow rate of the lToken pool needs to be at least 30% APY to ensure sufficient interest accrual.
2. The lToken pool needs to have no interactions (e.g., `mint`, `borrow`, `redeem`) for at least 12 hours to accumulate interest.
3. The user needs to hold at least $24,500 worth of lTokens to ensure a loss exceeding $10 at 0.0411%.

## External Pre-conditions
1. The underlying token’s price (e.g., USDC) needs to remain stable to ensure the loss is measurable in USD terms.
2. The oracle price feed for the lToken’s underlying asset needs to be consistent to avoid unrelated reverts.

## Attack Path
1. A user calls `redeem` on the Router contract with an amount of lTokens (e.g., 1,000,000 cUSDC, equivalent to $24,500).
2. The Router retrieves `exchangeRateStored()` without calling `accrueInterest()`, obtaining an outdated rate (e.g., 0.0245 USDC per cUSDC).
3. The Router calculates `expectedUnderlying` (e.g., 24,500 USDC for 1,000,000 cUSDC).
4. The Router calls `redeem` on the lToken, which invokes `accrueInterest()`, updating the exchange rate (e.g., to 0.02451011 USDC per cUSDC after 12 hours at 30% APY).
5. The lToken transfers the actual underlying amount (e.g., 24,510.11 USDC) to the Router.
6. The Router transfers only `expectedUnderlying` (24,500 USDC) to the user, retaining the excess (10.11 USDC).

## Impact
The user suffers an approximate loss of 0.0411% of their principal (e.g., $10.11 for a $24,500 principal), assuming a 30% APY pool and 12-hour delay. The Router contract retains the excess tokens, causing accounting inconsistencies.

## PoC
The proof of concept can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy a pool with an lToken (e.g., cUSDC) and set the borrow rate to 30% APY.
- Ensure the pool has no interactions for 12 hours, allowing interest to accrue.
- A user with 1,000,000 cUSDC (worth $24,500 at an exchange rate of 0.0245 USDC per cUSDC) calls `redeem` on the Router.
- The Router retrieves the outdated exchange rate (0.0245) and calculates an expected 24,500 USDC.
- The lToken’s `redeem` updates the exchange rate to 0.02451011 (after 12 hours of 30% APY), returning 24,510.11 USDC to the Router.
- The Router transfers 24,500 USDC to the user, retaining 10.11 USDC.
- The user’s loss is $10.11 (0.0411% of $24,500), and the Router’s state is inconsistent due to the excess.

## Mitigation
Add a call to `LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest()` before retrieving `exchangeRateStored()` in the `redeem` function to ensure the exchange rate is up-to-date. Example:
```solidity
require(LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest() == 0, "Accrue interest failed");
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
```
