# Inaccurate Exchange Rate Calculation Can Undercredit Users During Redemption

### Summary

The smart contract's `redeem()` function uses a stale exchange rate to calculate the expected amount of underlying tokens a user should receive when redeeming interest-bearing tokens. Specifically, the contract first computes `expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18`, where `exchangeRateBefore` is obtained from a function that does not trigger `accrueInterest()` (e.g., exchangeRateStored() or exchangeRate() without side effects). Immediately afterward, the contract calls `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)` to perform the actual redemption.

This `redeem()` function internally calls `accrueInterest()`, resulting in a new exchange rate that is higher than the previously fetched value. Thus, the underlying tokens received by the contract during redemption are based on the newer, more accurate exchange rate.

However, the amount credited or forwarded to the user is still computed using the older `exchangeRateBefore`, leading to a mismatch: the contract receives more tokens than it gives the user. This discrepancy results in users being underpaid relative to the actual value of their redeemed shares. The surplus underlying tokens remain trapped in the contract and may cause accounting errors, incorrect reward allocations, or systemic under-crediting of redemptions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- The contract calls `exchangeRate()` or similar to get `exchangeRateBefore`, which does not trigger interest accrual, resulting in a stale exchange rate being used.

- The contract calculates `expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18`. This is the amount the user is expected to receive and is based on the old exchange rate.

- Immediately afterward, the contract calls `LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount)`, which internally triggers `accrueInterest()`, updating the exchange rate to a higher value due to accumulated interest.

- The underlying token contract sends the actual (larger) amount of underlying tokens to the calling contract, based on the updated exchange rate.

- However, the contract still uses the previously computed `expectedUnderlying` (based on the stale exchange rate) to forward tokens to the user.

- As a result, the user receives fewer tokens than they should. The surplus tokens remain inside the contract unnoticed, silently accumulating over time.

### Impact

This bug creates loss for users, as they receive fewer underlying tokens than they should. Over time, repeated redemptions by multiple users can accumulate a significant unclaimed surplus in the contract.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the contract must ensure that accrueInterest() is invoked before calculating the exchange rate used in expectedUnderlying.
