# Stale Interest Data in Liquidity Calculations

## Summary
The lending protocol is exposed to a severe vulnerability due to its reliance on outdated interest data in liquidity calculations. Specifically, the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function in `LendStorage.sol`, being a `view` function, cannot update the state to accrue interest and thus uses stale values like `exchangeRateStored()` and the last recorded `borrowIndex`. Compounding this issue, the `CoreRouter.sol` contract only accrues interest for the token being acted upon, leaving other tokens in a user's portfolio with outdated data. This results in inaccurate liquidity assessments, enabling undercollateralized borrows, triggering incorrect liquidations, and causing redemption errors, all of which threaten the protocol's financial stability and user trust.

## Finding Description
The vulnerability arises from two interconnected issues within the lending protocol:
- Issue at [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152)

1. **Stale Data in View Function**:
   - The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function in `LendStorage.sol` is designed as a `view` function, which prohibits state modifications. Consequently, it cannot accrue interest and must rely on stored values such as `exchangeRateStored()` and the last recorded `borrowIndex`.
   - These values do not reflect the current accrued interest, leading to liquidity calculations that misrepresent the real-time value of collateral and borrowed amounts.

2. **Inconsistent Interest Accrual**:
   - In `CoreRouter.sol`, operations like borrowing or redeeming only trigger interest accrual for the specific token involved in the transaction (e.g., the borrowed token). Other tokens in the user's portfolio—whether supplied as collateral or borrowed—remain unupdated.
   - When liquidity is assessed via `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`, the calculation combines:
     - Freshly accrued data for the token being acted upon.
     - Stale data for all other tokens in the portfolio.
   - This mix of fresh and stale data distorts the true financial position of the user, undermining the protocol's ability to enforce its core invariant: `Total Collateral ≥ Total Borrows × Collateral Factor`.

These flaws create a systemic risk, as liquidity checks fail to accurately reflect the current state, potentially allowing unsafe operations to proceed.

## Example
To illustrate the vulnerability, consider the following scenario:

- A user supplies two assets as collateral: Asset A (valued at $1000) and Asset B (valued at $500).
- The user borrows Asset C, initially worth $400.
- Over time, interest accrues on all three assets, but the contract's stored values (`exchangeRateStored()` and `borrowIndex`) are not updated until a transaction triggers accrual.
- The user later attempts to borrow an additional $300 of Asset C:
  - The protocol calls `borrow()` in `CoreRouter.sol`, which accrues interest only for Asset C, updating its borrow balance (e.g., to $420 after interest).
  - The liquidity check via `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` uses:
    - The updated borrow balance of Asset C ($420 + $300 = $720 total borrow requested).
    - Stale collateral values for Asset A ($1000) and Asset B ($500), totaling $1500 in perceived collateral.
  - The check passes, assuming sufficient collateral (e.g., $1500 > $720 × Collateral Factor).
- However, if interest had accrued on Asset A and Asset B, their real collateral values might now be $950 and $475, respectively (totaling $1425). After accounting for the actual accrued interest, the collateral might no longer suffice, but the protocol approves the borrow based on stale data, resulting in an undercollateralized position.

## Impact
The consequences of this vulnerability are profound and multifaceted:

- **Undercollateralized Borrows**: Users can borrow amounts exceeding the true value of their collateral, creating loans that the protocol cannot fully recover in case of default. This jeopardizes the protocol's solvency.
- **Incorrect Liquidations**:
  - Overstated borrow balances (due to stale collateral data) may trigger liquidations of healthy accounts unnecessarily.
  - Conversely, understated collateral values may prevent the liquidation of insolvent accounts, delaying risk mitigation.
- **Redemption Errors**: When users redeem their supplied assets, discrepancies between stale calculated values and actual balances can result in incorrect payouts, leading to financial losses or user dissatisfaction.
- **Systemic Risk**: Persistent undercollateralization can accumulate unrecoverable debt, especially during volatile market conditions, threatening the protocol's long-term viability.
- **Exploitation Potential**: Malicious actors, such as MEV bots, could exploit this flaw by:
  - Front-running interest accruals to manipulate liquidity outcomes.
  - Triggering unwarranted liquidations on healthy accounts for profit.
  - Draining protocol reserves through precision attacks leveraging stale data.

## Proof of Concept
The following steps demonstrate how this vulnerability can be exploited:

1. A user supplies Asset A worth $1000 and borrows Asset B worth $500.
2. Time elapses, and interest accrues on both assets (e.g., Asset A's collateral value drops to $950, and Asset B's borrow balance rises to $520), but the stored values remain unchanged.
3. The user requests an additional $600 borrow of Asset B.
4. The protocol executes:
   - Interest accrual for Asset B, updating its borrow balance to $520.
   - A liquidity check using:
     - Stale collateral value of Asset A ($1000, instead of $950).
     - Updated borrow balance of Asset B ($520 + $600 = $1120 total borrow requested).
5. The check passes based on the stale $1000 collateral value, approving the $600 borrow.
6. In reality, the true collateral value ($950) is insufficient to support the total borrow ($1120), violating the collateralization requirement.
7. The protocol now holds an undercollateralized loan, risking a $170 shortfall if the user defaults.

This sequence highlights how stale data enables unsafe operations, exposing the protocol to financial risk.

## Recommendation

**Use Current Values in Liquidity Calculations**:
   - Modify `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` in `LendStorage.sol` to accrue interest dynamically and use real-time values, removing the `view` modifier.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(address user, ...) public returns (uint, uint) {
         asset.accrueInterest(); // Update state
         vars.exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: asset.exchangeRateCurrent()});
         // Perform calculations with current exchange rate
         return (borrowed, collateral);
     }
     ```
