# Incorrect calculation of borrowed amount in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal

### Summary

Double interest applied in borrowed amount calculation causes inflated borrow values and incorrect liquidation checks.

### Root Cause

An insufficient shortfall is checked when `borrowedAmount > collateral`. The  `borrowedAmount` is calculated inside the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal `function as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L348
```solidity
 borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
```

The borrowed value passed into this function comes from `liquidateBorrow`, where it is calculated using `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`:

```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);

        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
```

The function` getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` already returns the borrowed amount with accrued interest included, since it internally uses the `borrowWithInterestSame` and `borrowWithInterest` methods.

As a result, when the protocol calculates shortfall, it applies interest a second time by again multiplying the already interest-included borrowed amount by the current borrow index and dividing by the stored index.

This causes the `borrowedAmount` used for shortfall checks to be inflated beyond the actual debt.

### Impact

Users may be incorrectly flagged for liquidation due to an artificially high perceived borrow amount.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Avoid double-applying interest. If the borrowed amount already includes accrued interest, it should not be adjusted again using the borrow index.
