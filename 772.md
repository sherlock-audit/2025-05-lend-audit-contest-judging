# Blocked Cross-Chain Liquidation in `_checkLiquidationValid`

## Summary
The [_checkLiquidationValid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L431) function in `CrossChainRouter.sol` incorrectly reverts cross-chain liquidations if seizing collateral on chain A (source chain) would cause the borrower’s account to become undercollateralized. This prevents the liquidation of unhealthy debts on chain B (destination chain), disrupting the protocol’s core debt management functionality and leading to debt accumulation and systemic risk.

## Root Cause
In `CrossChainRouter.sol`, the `_checkLiquidationValid` function:
```solidity
function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );
    return borrowed > collateral;
}
```
This function checks whether seizing `payload.amount` (collateral tokens) on chain A keeps the borrower’s account sufficiently collateralized. If `borrowed > collateral` after the hypothetical seizure, the liquidation is blocked, and a `LiquidationFailure` message is sent back to chain B, preventing the debt from being liquidated.

The logic is flawed because it prioritizes maintaining collateralization on chain A over liquidating unhealthy debts on chain B, which is critical for protocol solvency. A correct implementation should allow liquidation to proceed if the debt on chain B is liquidatable, even if it results in undercollateralization on chain A.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports cross-chain borrowing and liquidation, with collateral on chain A and debts on chain B.
2. `lendStorage.crossChainBorrows` and `crossChainCollaterals` track cross-chain positions.
3. The `_checkLiquidationValid` function enforces that collateral seizure on chain A does not cause undercollateralization.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A borrower has collateral (e.g., $1000 ETH) on chain A and a liquidatable debt (e.g., $900 USDC) on chain B.
2. The borrower’s account on chain A is close to undercollateralization (e.g., $1000 collateral vs. $950 debt).
3. A liquidator initiates `liquidateCrossChain` on chain B to repay part of the debt and seize collateral from chain A.

## Attack Path
1. **Borrower’s Position**:
   - Borrower has $1000 ETH collateral and $950 USDC debt on chain A, and a liquidatable $900 USDC debt on chain B.
2. **Liquidation Attempt**:
   - Liquidator calls `liquidateCrossChain` on chain B to repay $450 USDC and seize $500 ETH from chain A.
3. **Validation Failure**:
   - On chain A, `_checkLiquidationValid` simulates seizing $500 ETH, reducing collateral to $500 vs. $950 debt.
   - Since `borrowed > collateral` ($950 > $500), the function returns `false`, triggering `_sendLiquidationFailure`.
4. **Debt Persists**:
   - The $900 USDC debt on chain B remains unliquidated, accumulating interest and increasing protocol risk.

## Impact
- **Broken Functionality**: The inability to liquidate unhealthy debts on chain B violates the protocol’s core debt management mechanism, as outlined in Sherlock’s Section V (core protocol functionality).
- **Relevant Loss**: No alternative mechanism exists to handle this scenario in the code, and this flaw can lead to debt accumulation and indirect losses (>0.01% and >$10), as unliquidated debts grow and pose systemic risks to the protocol’s solvency.
- **Sherlock Criteria**: The issue requires a specific condition (borrower’s account on chain A near undercollateralization), making it plausible but not trivial, justifying **Medium** severity per Sherlock’s guidelines.

## Mitigation
Modify `_checkLiquidationValid` to allow liquidations to proceed if the debt on chain B is liquidatable, even if it causes undercollateralization on chain A. A partial liquidation mechanism or a warning event can be implemented to manage risks. Suggested change:
```solidity
function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );
    if (borrowed > collateral) {
        // Emit warning for undercollateralization but allow liquidation
        emit PartialLiquidationWarning(payload.sender, payload.destlToken, payload.amount);
    }
    return true; // Allow liquidation regardless of collateral status
}
```
This ensures unhealthy debts on chain B can be liquidated, reducing systemic risk while logging undercollateralization events for monitoring.
