# Incorrect Debt Clearance During Cross-Chain Repayments Leading to Protocol Losses

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the repayment logic where clearing a cross-chain debt position incorrectly removes same-chain debt records. This allows borrowers to manipulate debt accounting, potentially leaving the protocol with unrecoverable bad debt.

### Root Cause

The `repayBorrowInternal()` function fails to properly segregate same-chain and cross-chain debt positions. When a borrower repays a cross-chain loan, the function unconditionally calls:

```solidity
if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }
```

These storage updates affect same-chain  debts due to shared storage structures, allowing malicious borrowers to erase legitimate same-chain debts while only repaying cross-chain obligations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. The borrower has active loans on both the same chain and at least one cross-chain.

2. The borrower initiates a repayment  on a cross-chain loan.

### Attack Path

1. Borrow on Same-Chain (Chain A)

User borrows 100 USDC via `borrow()` on Chain A (same-chain debt recorded).

2. Borrow on Cross-Chain (Chain B)

User borrows another 100 USDC on Chain A, using Chain B collateral (cross-chain debt recorded).

3. Repay Cross-Chain Debt

User calls `repayCrossChainBorrow()` to repay 100 USDC on Chain B.

The function processes repayment and incorrectly clears same-chain debt records due to shared storage.

### Impact

The protocol will loses track of legitimate same-chain debts, leading to unrecoverable funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if it's same chain before updating the same  chain state.
