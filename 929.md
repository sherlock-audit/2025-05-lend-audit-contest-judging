# Same Collateral for Multiple Loans Across Chains

### Summary

In `CrossChainRouter.BorrowCrossChain()` there is a missing check to evaluate that before proceeding with a cross chain request, `totalCollateral` is greater than `totalBorrows` for the borrower in the source chain.

### Root Cause

In `CrossChainRouter.BorrowCrossChain()` the current value of `totalCollateral` of the borrower is being passed in the message to the destination chain. But this `totalCollateral` value may have existing borrowings both on the same chain and other cross chains. Only if `totalCollateral > totalBorrows`, it should proceed with the value which should be the difference between the two.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits an asset `Token` and gets `lToken`.
2. User borrows against `lToken` on the same chain, increasing his `borrowBalance`.
3. If this `lToken` is mapped for cross chain borrowings on other chains, User starts borrowing on all such chains showing the same `lToken` amount as collateral.

### Impact

This exploit allows a user to reuse the same `lToken` collateral across multiple chains, effectively inflating their borrowing capacity. By borrowing on the same chain first and then initiating cross-chain loans using the same `lToken`, the user bypasses proper collateral accounting. This can lead to **over-leveraging**, where the total borrowed value across chains far exceeds the actual collateral backing it. If market volatility occurs or the user defaults, the protocol may suffer **severe bad debt and insolvency risks**.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the missing sanity check inside 'borrowCrossChain()` before sending a cross chain message.
