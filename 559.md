# Incorrect cross-chain collateral lookup in liquidation success handler causes revert

### Summary

During a cross-chain borrow, the collateral is stored in the `crossChainCollaterals` mapping on the destination chain inside the `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()` function. It correctly records the source and destination chain IDs like this:

```solidity
// this is how it is stored
lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(
    payload.sender,
    destUnderlying,
    LendStorage.Borrow({
        srcEid: srcEid,                  // source chain ID
        destEid: currentEid,             // destination chain ID (current chain)
        principle: payload.amount,
        borrowIndex: currentBorrowIndex,
        borrowedlToken: payload.destlToken,
        srcToken: payload.srcToken
    })
);
```

However, when the corresponding liquidation success message is handled (in `_handleLiquidationSuccess` on the same destination chain), the protocol tries to retrieve this borrow record using incorrect parameters:

```solidity
// this is how it is accessed
(bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
    payload.sender,
    underlying,
    currentEid,       // incorrect: using current chain as srcEid
    0,                // incorrect: passing 0 as destEid will not match any borrows
    payload.destlToken,
    payload.srcToken
);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L448-L455

This leads to a critical mismatch:

- The `srcEid` is incorrectly set to `currentEid` instead of the original source chain ID (`srcEid`) from the LZ message.
- The `destEid` is set to `0`, which will never match any actual borrow records.

Because of this mismatch, `findCrossChainCollateral` always returns `(false, 0)` and the function `_handleLiquidationSuccess` reverts with `"Borrow position not found"`, even though the borrow was correctly recorded earlier.



### Root Cause

Incorrect `srcEid` and `destEid` are passed to `findCrossChainCollateral()` in `_handleLiquidationSuccess()`:
- `srcEid` is mistakenly passed as `currentEid` (destination chain ID), instead of the original `srcEid`.
- `destEid` is passed as `0`, making it impossible to match the borrow record even if other parameters match.

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice initiates a cross-chain borrow from Chain A to Chain B.
2. Chain B stores the borrow with `srcEid = Chain A` and `destEid = Chain B`.
3. Later, her position is liquidated and a `LiquidationSuccess` message is sent to Chain B.
4. `_handleLiquidationSuccess()` tries to find Aliceâ€™s borrow position using:
   - `srcEid = Chain B` (incorrect)
   - `destEid = 0` (incorrect)
5. The borrow is not found and the function reverts, breaking the liquidation flow.
6. Result: liquidation does not complete and can leave system state inconsistent.

### Impact

- Liquidation success messages will **always revert**, effectively **breaking the cross-chain liquidation system**.
- Collateral may be seized on source chain, but the borrow will never paid by the liquidator on the destination chain, causing huge loss to the user.
- Can lead to denial of service in liquidation flow and  bad debt accumulation for the protocol.

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Update `_handleLiquidationSuccess` to pass correct values to `findCrossChainCollateral()`:

- Use `_origin.srcEid` instead of `currentEid`
- pass currentEid for destEid
