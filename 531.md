# Lack of NonBlocking mechanism will lead to the blocking/DoS'ed LayerZero channels

### Summary

The protocol uses `LayerZero` for cross chain functionalities, main functions of it implemented in the `CrossChainRouter.sol` `_send` and `_lzReceive` functions used for relaying the messages from one to chain to another. 

Coming to the issue here that is:
According to the LayerZero Docs by default the behavior is of `blocking` meaning that - quoting this from the docs- if there occurs an out of gas or a logical error on the destination , all the transactions behind will be queued. (https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/troubleshooting/faq#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20messages%20will%20be%20queued%20if%20there%20is%20an%20out%2Dof%2Dgas%2C%20or%20logical%20error%20on%20the%20destination.) i.e the channel will be blocked and no new messages will be sent until the failed transaction is retried and successful.

So a malicious user can exploit this issue by on purpose knowingly initiating a transaction(lets say for eg sufficient gas wasnt sent for the tx to be completed) they know that will fail. This will lead to permanent blocking of the messaging channel rendering all the cross chain functionality of the protocol inoperable and useless

### Root Cause

The `CrossChainRouter.sol` does not implement the NonBlocking mechanism as mentioned in the docs [here](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/troubleshooting/faq#:~:text=If%20contract%20developers%20wish%20to%20avoid%20the%20default%20blocking%20mechanism%2C%20instead%20use%20NonblockingLzApp%20which%20will%20continue%20with%20the%20flow%20of%20messages%2C%20a%20design%20which%20stores%20out%2Dof%2Dgas%20messages%20on%20the%20destination%20to%20be%20retried%20(by%20anyone)%20at%20anytime.)

### Internal Pre-conditions

Attacker initiates a transacton that he knows will end up failing.

### External Pre-conditions

See internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Attacker initiates a transacton that he knows will end up failing.
This will be enough to block the whole LayerZero channel

### Impact

High/criticial- The whole layer zero communication channel will be blocked/DoS meaning the transactions will be queued as stated in the docs. And all is need to perform this attack is that one tx that will fail and can be due to anything, for eg out of gas

### PoC

The cross chain router contract does not use the NonBlockingLzApp as suggested by the layer zero docs

### Mitigation

Consider using the mitigation that the Layer Zero docs suggests i.e use `NonBlockingLzApp`. Here is an example [NonBlockingLzApp.sol](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/endpoint-v1-solidity-examples/blob/main/contracts/lzApp/NonblockingLzApp.sol)
