# Rounding Issue In CoreRouter::redeem could lead to massive loss of funds for users

### Summary

In the [CoreRouter::redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L118)

we are using integer division which rounds down in Solidity.

```Solidity
// In redeem function:
uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
```

in which the `_amount` is the user entered amount:

```solidity
     IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```

which is further transferred back to the user:



this could lead to a massive  loss of user funds while calculating the `expectedUnderlying` .

We have two cases:

1. Low exchange Rate when market is fresh and the user redeems a larger amount leading to loss of nearly 5%. Could lead to more depending on the amount and the exchange Rate.

```solidity


// Exchange rate: 0.020012345678901234e18 (just above initial 0.02)
// User redeems: 999 lTokens

uint256 expectedUnderlying = (999 * 20012345678901234) / 1e18;
// = 19992333333334665766 / 1e18  
// = 19.992333... → truncated to 19 tokens

// LOSS: 0.992333 tokens per transaction (~5% loss!)


```


2.  User redeems multiple times

```solidity
// User has 10,000 lTokens, redeems in 100 transactions of 100 lTokens each
// Exchange rate: 1.001234567890123456e18

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    uint256 underlying = (100 * 1001234567890123456) / 1e18;
    // = 100.1234567... → truncated to 100
    // Loss per transaction: 0.1234567... tokens
}

// Total loss: ~12.34567 tokens out of ~10,012 expected
// Percentage loss: ~0.12%

```

### Root Cause

- Rounding down on the value while we should be rounding up.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- None

### External Pre-conditions

- None

### Attack Path

- Not an attack, could be caused by regular user operations. It's an logical error, not an attack.

### Impact

- The user suffers a massive loss of his funds while redeeming the value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Round up instead of rounding down.
