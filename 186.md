# Incorrect variable used for collateral verification bypasses proper debt validation

## Description:
The `borrow()` function in CoreRouter.sol uses an incorrect variable for collateral verification. The function calls `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` which correctly calculates the total debt after the new borrow operation, but then ignores this authoritative result and instead compares collateral against a different debt calculation that excludes the new loan amount.

```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    // ... other code ...
    
    // Gets total debt AFTER new borrow (includes current debt + new loan)
    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

    // Calculates current debt with interest but WITHOUT the new loan
    uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
        ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
        : 0;

    // VULNERABILITY: Compares against borrowAmount instead of borrowed
    require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
    // Should be: require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
}
```

The issue is that `borrowAmount` represents only the current debt with accrued interest, while `borrowed` represents the total debt after adding the new loan. The collateral check should validate against the complete future debt state, not just the current debt.

Attack path:
1. Attacker has existing debt that when combined with a new loan would exceed their collateral capacity
2. The getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral correctly calculates that borrowed (total debt after new loan) exceeds available collateral
3. However, the function incorrectly validates collateral >= borrowAmount where borrowAmount only includes current debt with interest
4. Since current debt alone may be within collateral limits, the check passes
5. The new loan is approved even though the total debt (current + new) exceeds safe collateralization ratios
6. Attacker receives the loan while being undercollateralized

## Impact:
The protocol approves loans that result in undercollateralized positions
Users can borrow beyond their actual collateral capacity
Increased risk of bad debt and protocol insolvency

Recommended Mitigation:
Use the correct variable from the hypothetical calculation that includes the complete debt after the new borrow
