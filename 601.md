# Missing Slippage Protection in `redeem` Function

### Summary


The `redeem` function in the `CoreRouter` contract lacks slippage protection, exposing users to the risk of receiving fewer tokens than expected when redeeming their lTokens. This can result in significant user fund loss during price volatility, manipulation, or rapid market changes.


### Root Cause


The function calculates the expected amount of underlying tokens based on `exchangeRateStored()`, but it does not verify that the actual amount received meets the userâ€™s expectations. There is no `minAmountOut` parameter to protect against slippage, leaving users vulnerable. This is because the exchange rate used in redeem is not fixed; it is recalculated on every interaction using several on-chain variables (`totalCash`, `totalBorrows`, `totalReserves`, and `totalSupply`). Without the ability to specify a minimum acceptable output (`minAmountOut`), the function executes even if the actual redeemed amount is significantly lower than expected.


```solidity
        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;

        // Perform redeem
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");

        // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
        IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

```

**Why `minAmountOut` is Necessary**

The exchange rate in the protocol is dynamically computed each time `exchangeRateCurrent()` is called, based on the formula:

```solidity
if totalSupply == 0:
    exchangeRate = initialExchangeRateMantissa
else:
    exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) * 1e18 / totalSupply
```

This rate fluctuates due to:

* Interest accrued on loans (`totalBorrows` and `totalReserves` increase).
* Changes in liquidity (`totalCash`) from mint or redeem actions.
* Total supply of lTokens (`totalSupply`) changing over time.

Because the exchange rate can change between the time a user obtains an off-chain quote and the time their redeem transaction executes on-chain, the user must be able to specify a `minAmountOut` to guard against receiving less than their expected amount.

Without this, users are exposed to exchange rate slippage and may redeem fewer underlying tokens than anticipated.


### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path


1. User calls off-chain `exchangeRateCurrent()` to estimate the expected underlying tokens for redeeming `_amount` of lTokens.
2. User submits `redeem(_amount)` transaction without specifying a minimum output.
3. Between off-chain quote and on-chain execution, exchange rate changes (due to interest accrual, borrow activity, reserves update, or manipulation).
4. The contract redeems tokens at a lower exchange rate, resulting in fewer underlying tokens returned to the user.
5. User suffers a loss, with no ability to revert due to missing minimum output enforcement.

### Impact

Users may receive significantly fewer underlying tokens than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Introduce a `minAmountOut` parameter to the `redeem` function to let users specify the minimum acceptable amount of underlying tokens.
