# Cross-Chain Funds/Rewards Misdirection Due to Account Abstraction Wallet Incompatibility

### Summary

An **incorrect design choice** will cause a **permanent loss of funds or seized collateral/rewards** for **users and liquidators utilizing account abstraction wallets** as the protocol's cross-chain functions will **send tokens to inaccessible addresses on destination chains due to differing wallet addresses.**

### Root Cause

The choice to **implicitly use `msg.sender` (or an address derived directly from the initiating transaction's sender) as the recipient of funds/rewards on the destination chain** in both the `borrowCrossChain` and `liquidateCrossChain` functions is an issue. Account abstraction wallets (e.g. [**Safe Wallet**](https://safe.global/dataroom)) often have different addresses across different chains for the same logical account, leading to funds or seized assets being sent to an inaccessible address on the destination chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* **For Borrowers:**
    * `msg.sender` needs to be an **account abstraction wallet address** on the source chain (Chain A).
    * `_amount` needs to be **greater than 0**.
    * `_borrowToken` needs to be a **supported token** on the source chain.
    * `_destEid` needs to be a **valid destination chain ID**.
    * The contract needs to have **sufficient ETH balance** for cross-chain fees.
    * The user needs to have **collateral supplied** for the `_borrowToken` on the source chain.
* **For Liquidators:**
    * `msg.sender` (the liquidator) needs to be an **account abstraction wallet address** on Chain B (where debt exists).
    * A **cross-chain borrow position** must exist that is eligible for liquidation.
    * `repayAmount` needs to be **greater than 0** and less than or equal to `maxLiquidationAmount`.
    * `srcEid` needs to be the **correct chain ID** where the collateral exists (Chain A).

### External Pre-conditions

* N/A

### Attack Path

This describes a vulnerability path, not an attack path:

1.  **Scenario A: Borrower Misdirection (`borrowCrossChain`):**
    1.  **User (using an account abstraction wallet on Chain A)** calls `borrowCrossChain` on Chain A, specifying `_amount`, `_borrowToken`, and `_destEid` (Chain B).
    2.  The `borrowCrossChain` function prepares the LayerZero message, using `msg.sender` (which is the AA wallet's address on Chain A) as the intended recipient for the borrowed funds on Chain B.
    3.  The LayerZero message is sent to Chain B.
    4.  On Chain B, the corresponding cross-chain receive function processes the message and attempts to send the borrowed `_amount` of `_borrowToken` to the address derived from the `msg.sender` from Chain A.
    5.  Since the user's account abstraction wallet on Chain B has a *different* address than its Chain A counterpart, the tokens are sent to an address on Chain B that the user does not control or cannot access with their Chain B wallet.

2.  **Scenario B: Liquidator Reward Misdirection (`liquidateCrossChain`):**
    1.  **Liquidator (using an account abstraction wallet on Chain B)** calls `liquidateCrossChain` on Chain B to repay a borrower's debt and seize collateral on Chain A.
    2.  The `_executeLiquidationCore` function sends a LayerZero message to Chain A, including `msg.sender` (the liquidator's Chain B address) as the `liquidator` in the payload.
    3.  The LayerZero message arrives on Chain A and is processed by `_handleLiquidationExecute`.
    4.  Within `_handleLiquidationExecute` on Chain A, the `payload.liquidator` (which is the liquidator's Chain B address) is used to:
        * `lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(payload.destlToken, payload.liquidator)` (distribute LEND rewards).
        * `lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken, ...)` (update liquidator's seized collateral balance).
    5.  Since the liquidator's account abstraction wallet on Chain A has a *different* address than its Chain B counterpart, the seized collateral and LEND rewards are assigned to an address on Chain A that the liquidator does not control or cannot access with their Chain A wallet.

### Impact

The **users (borrowers)** suffer a **permanent loss of the borrowed `_amount` of `_borrowToken`**. The **liquidators** suffer a **permanent loss of their seized collateral and LEND rewards**. The protocol does not suffer a direct financial loss, but user experience is severely impacted, potentially leading to a significant loss of trust and adoption. The attacker gains N/A (this is not an attack).

### PoC

N/A (This is a conceptual design flaw demonstrated by the logic and interaction with account abstraction wallets, not requiring a specific exploit script beyond understanding how AA wallets function cross-chain).

### Mitigation

The protocol must allow users and liquidators to explicitly specify a `_recipient` address on the destination chain for any inbound funds or rewards from cross-chain operations.

* For `borrowCrossChain`: Add an `address _recipientOnDestChain` parameter to the function. This `_recipientOnDestChain` should be included in the LayerZero message and used on the destination chain to transfer the borrowed tokens.
* For `liquidateCrossChain`: The `_send` call within `_executeLiquidationCore` (which targets Chain A for collateral seizure) should include an explicit `_liquidatorRecipientOnChainA` parameter. This parameter would then be used in `_handleLiquidationExecute` on Chain A for `distributeSupplierLend` and `updateTotalInvestment` for the liquidator's share.
