# Double scaling of `borrowed` amount in `borrow()` prevents maximum borrowing

### Summary

In `borrow()` function, the `borrowed` amount is incorrectly scaled a second time using `borrowIndex`, even though it has already been adjusted during the call to `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. This leads to overestimation of the borrow amount, which could cause users being denied valid borrow requests.


### Root Cause

In [`borrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L161) function, first scaling is done in a call to [`getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L425-L428) function. This scaling is done in (same-chain borrow)[`borrowWithInterestSame()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L509-L515) and (cross-chain borrow) [`borrowWithInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L478-L504)
same-chain borrow:
```solidity
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

        // @audit second scaling done here
>>      uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;

        require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
The check done then compares the first returned `collateral` against a double scaled `borrowed`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Existing borrow positions with accrued interest

### External Pre-conditions

1. User attempts to make another borrow

### Attack Path

1. User amkes an initial borrow
2. Time elapses and intrest is accrued
3. User attempts a second borrow
4. Returned borrow is doubled scaled resulting in revert as collateral is less


### Impact

The borrower's debt is overestimated therefore users with healthy collateral ratios may appear undercollateralized and this will results in blocked borrows even when they have enough collateral


### PoC
1. Add the following test in `test/TestBorrowing.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function test_that_double_scaling_in_borrow_prevents_maxBorrow(uint256 amount) public {
        vm.assume(amount > 1e18 && amount < 1e36);
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // Supply collateral
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(amount);

        uint256 borrowAmount = (amount * 40) / 100; // 40% of collateral 

        // Expect BorrowSuccess event
        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit BorrowSuccess(deployer, lToken, borrowAmount);

        // user makes first borrow
        coreRouter.borrow(borrowAmount, token);

        // Verify the borrow succeeded 
        assertEq(
            lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(deployer, lToken),
            borrowAmount
        );

        // Advance some blocks to accrue interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1000);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1000);

        // get maxBorrow now
        uint256 maxBorrow = lendStorage.getMaxBorrowAmount(deployer, lToken);

        // attempt this borrow: expect revert 
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Insufficient collateral"));
        coreRouter.borrow(maxBorrow, token);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Remove the re-scaling done in `borrow()`
