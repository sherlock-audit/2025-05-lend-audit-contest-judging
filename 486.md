# Cross-Chain Collateral Can Back Multiple Independent Borrows Leading to Over-Leveraging

### Summary

The cross-chain borrowing system treats each bilateral chain relationship as independent, allowing the same collateral on the source chain to back multiple simultaneous borrows on different destination chains. This enables users to achieve leverage ratios far exceeding protocol limits by creating multiple independent cross-chain relationships using the same underlying collateral.


### Root Cause

The protocol validates each cross-chain borrow in isolation without tracking or limiting how much of the source chain's collateral has already been allocated to other cross-chain borrows. Each destination chain only validates against the total collateral value without knowledge of other chains' borrows against the same collateral.
The collateral is calculated in [`BorrowCrossChain`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L138) from the function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` but this function only returns the collateral without substracting any debt whether it's on the same chain or crossChain, and afterwards we validate the capacity of the borrow:
```javascript
// In _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest on each destination chain
function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
    // Get total borrow including new amount
    (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
        payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
    );

    // BUG: Only validates against total collateral, ignores other chains' borrows
    require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
    
    // Execute borrow without global coordination
    CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, destUnderlying);
}
```
Each chain performs the validation `payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed` independently, treating the full collateral value as available for its own borrowing relationship.


### Internal Pre-conditions

User must have collateral supplied on source chain (Chain A)

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol must support multiple destination chains (Chain B, C, D, etc.)


### Attack Path

User has a collateral of 8000$ in chainA
He borrows 5000$ on chainB
He borrows 5000$ on chainC
He borrows 5000$ on chainD
Total Collateral: $800 (effective, on Chain A only)
Total Debt: $15,000 ($15,000 Ã— 3 chains)
Leverage Ratio: $15,000 / $8000 =  185% (vs intended ~75% max)
User is overleveraged and can drain the funds



### Impact

This will cause solvency of the protocol as the total debt across all chains exceeds total collateral value

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Distract the debt over other chains before sending the payload to the chainB
