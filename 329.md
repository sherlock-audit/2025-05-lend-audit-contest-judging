# Incorrect if clause in LendStorage::borrowWithInterest leads to cross chain borrows not being added to the borrowed amount which breaks the liquidation and LEND distribution system

### Summary

This report details a critical bug in the `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest` function, where an incorrect `if` condition causes all cross-chain borrows to be excluded from borrow calculations. As a result, core protocol functions—such as liquidation and LEND token distribution—fail to operate correctly when a user has a cross-chain borrow originating from the current chain. The issue can be resolved by removing the unnecessary `destEid == currentEid` check to ensure accurate accounting of cross-chain borrows.

### Root Cause

First, we need to examine how the collateral mapping is populated. When a user initiates a cross-chain borrow using CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain, a payload is sent to the receiving chain, which is then handled through CrossChainRouter::lz_receive and `CrossChainRouter::_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`. Here, the mapping is populated using the origin's ChainID as `borrow.srcEID` and the destination's ChainID (e.g., the current ID, as this is happening on the receiver side) as `borrow.destEid`.

When we now look at the helper function `LendStorage::borroWithInterest`, we can see that the if clause in Line 497 could never be triggered, as  this function is specifically for cross-chain borrows (`borrowWithInterestSame` is the equivalent for same-chain borrows), and in that case `borrow.srcEID` and `borrow.destEid` will never both be `currentEid`

A multitude of core functionalities of the protocol rely on `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest`, for example, to calculate Token distribution as in the case of `LendStorage::distributeBorrowerLend` or to calculate an account's liquidity by adding up all borrows and collateral using `LendStorage::getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral`. 

As all functions that rely on `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest` will receive an incorrect return value as soon as a user has a single cross-chain borrow that originates on the chain that is used to call any afflicted function, most core functionalities of the protocol are affected. The entire liquidation system will no longer function, as cross-chain collateral is counted while cross-chain borrows are not, which hinders unhealthy positions from being liquidated. 

Further, the wrong return values of `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest` will also lead to borrowers receiving fewer/no LEND tokens. Because of the bug, `LendStorage::distributeBorrowerLend` will not count any cross-chain borrows that originated on the chain on which the function is called, leading to fewer or possibly no LEND tokens being distributed to the user. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal preconditions required

### External Pre-conditions

The user needs to have at least one active cross-chain borrow originating on the chain on which they are calling any afflicted function 

### Attack Path

User X initiates a borrow from Chain A to Chain B
User X's position becomes unhealthy
User Y tries to liquidate User X from Chain A, but can't as the position is still assumed healthy when checking from Chain A, since the amount User X has borrowed is not returned by `borrowWithInterest` 
This enables User X to borrow an indefinite amount of Tokens without being liquidatable from Chain A


### Impact

High - breaks core protocol functionality

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Simply remove the check for `collaterals[i].destEid currentEid` from the if clause in `LendStorage::borrowWithInterest` and the function will function as intended

```diff
function borrowWithInterest(address borrower, address _lToken) public view returns (uint256) {
address _token = lTokenToUnderlying[_lToken];
uint256 borrowedAmount;

Borrow[] memory borrows = crossChainBorrows[borrower][_token];
Borrow[] memory collaterals = crossChainCollaterals[borrower][_token];
  
require(borrows.length == 0 || collaterals.length == 0, "Invariant violated: both mappings populated");
// Only one mapping should be populated:
if (borrows.length > 0) {
for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) 
if (borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
borrowedAmount +=
(borrows[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / borrows[i].borrowIndex;
}
}
} else {
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
// Only include a cross-chain collateral borrow if it originated locally.
- if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
+ if (collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
borrowedAmount +=
(collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
}
}
}
return borrowedAmount;
}
```
