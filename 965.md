# Healthy Position can be Liquidated

### Summary

In `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowInternal`, there's no check to ensure the position is actually underwater. The only requirement is `borrowedAmount > collateral`. Any position even healthy ones can be liquidated by malicious liquidators. 

### Root Cause

In the `coreRouter.sol` contract., when the `LiquidateBorrow` is called , we have other internal calls 
```solidity
  * @notice Liquidates a borrower's position for same chain borrows.
     * @param borrower The address of the borrower
     * @param repayAmount The amount to repay
     * @param lTokenCollateral The address of the collateral lToken
     * @param borrowedAsset The address of the asset that was borrowed
     */
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)        
        external
    {
       
        // The lToken of the borrowed asset
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset);         

        LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);

        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }
```
Tracing down the the [`liquidateBorrowInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L256-L275) there's no logic to actually check if the position is undercollaterized, hence any position can be liquidated. 
```solidity
function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // Determine borrowIndex and borrowAmount based on chain type
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

        // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");         // @audit -  

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
            uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
                Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
            );

            require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
        }

        return 0;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A liquidator needs to call the `LiquidateBorrow` function
2. A borrower position needs to be healthy

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

Nil

### Impact

Borrowers are unfairly liquidated. Leading to users loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent liquidation if users are not undercollaterized.
