# Incorrect supply index update allows theft of LEND rewards.

### Summary

Users are given LEND rewards when they supply. This is based on how much they supply and the rewards are credited with time. [LendStorage::distributeSupplierLend()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L303) is responsible for this. The function is called when a user supply and redeem. 

Here, the user's `lendSupplierIndex` is set to the up-to-date `supplyIndex`. However for first time supplying, `supplierIndex` is set to `LEND_INITIAL_INDEX`. This is then used to calculate the `deltaIndex`, which is used to calculate how much LEND should be given to the supplier. This means no matter the time of the supply, the user gets LEND rewards as if he had supplied from the very start of the reward distribution. This allows malicious users to supply and redeem with a large amount to get LEND rewards at 0 cost within the same block.


### Root Cause

```solidity 
    function distributeSupplierLend(address lToken, address supplier) external onlyAuthorized {
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).triggerSupplyIndexUpdate(lToken);
        (uint224 supplyIndex,) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).lendSupplyState(lToken);
        uint256 supplierIndex = lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier];
        lendSupplierIndex[lToken][supplier] = supplyIndex;
        if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
@>          supplierIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX; 
        }
        Double memory deltaIndex = Double({mantissa: sub_(supplyIndex, supplierIndex)}); 
        uint256 supplierTokens = totalInvestment[supplier][lToken];
        uint256 supplierDelta = mul_(supplierTokens, deltaIndex);
        uint256 supplierAccrued = add_(lendAccrued[supplier], supplierDelta);
        lendAccrued[supplier] = supplierAccrued;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path


1. The LEND_INITIAL_INDEX is 1e36. Time passes and supplyIndex is increased to 2e36.
2. The attacker supplies 100e18 token for the first time.
3. His `lendSupplierIndex` is updated to 2e36 but `supplierIndex` is set to 1e36.
4. The `deltaIndex` is 1e36, giving the attacker 100e18 LEND tokens. 
5. The attacker redeem and claim his LEND tokens. 


### Impact

LEND rewards can be stolen from users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dont calculate rewards on first supplies or set the supplierIndex to supplyIndex.
