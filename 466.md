# Users will receive incorrect tokens due to stale exchange rate calculations in supply and redeem functions

### Summary

Using `exchangeRateStored()` instead of `exchangeRateCurrent()` in both supply and redeem functions will cause incorrect token calculations for users as the interest is not accrued before calculating the exchange rates, leading to mismatches between recorded and actual token amounts.

### Root Cause

In `CoreRouter.sol` contract, the `exchangeRateStored()` is called to calculate tokens in both [supply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L74) and [redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L115) functions before interest accrual, but the subsequent [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L385) and [redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L455) operations internally accrue interest, causing discrepancies between calculated and actual amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Time must have passed since last interest accrual
2. Market must have outstanding borrows generating interest
3. User must call either supply() or redeem() functions

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

For supply():

1. User calls supply() with _amount tokens
2. CoreRouter gets stale exchangeRate using exchangeRateStored()
3. CoreRouter calculates mintTokens using this stale rate
4. mint() function is called which:
- Accrues interest, updating the exchange rate
- Mints tokens using the new exchange rate
5. The recorded mintTokens in storage differs from actual minted amount

For redeem():
1. User calls redeem() with _amount tokens
2. CoreRouter gets stale exchangeRate using exchangeRateStored()
3. CoreRouter calculates expectedUnderlying using stale rate
4. redeem() function accrues interest and redeems with new rate
5. User receives different amount than calculated

### Impact

Users receive incorrect accounting of their minted and redeemed tokens. The difference between recorded and actual amounts grows larger as more time passes between interest accruals.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the supply function to use exchangeRateCurrent() which accrues interest:
```diff
function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        //...

        // Get exchange rate before mint
-       uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();
+       uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateCurrent();

        // Mint lTokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

        // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
        uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;

       //...
    }
```
And do the same for redeem function
