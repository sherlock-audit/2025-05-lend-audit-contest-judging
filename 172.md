# Cross-Chain Borrow Collateral Check Does Not Account for Accrued Interest

### Summary

The collateral sufficiency check in the cross-chain borrow flow uses `lendStorage.sol#getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` without applying accrued interest on existing borrow positions. This allows users with existing debt to borrow more than they should, because the system underestimates the actual debt by ignoring accrued interest during the check.

### Root Cause

When handling a borrow request on the destination chain, the contract checks if the collateral from the source chain is sufficient against the total borrowed amount. However, the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` call does not factor in accrued interest on existing cross-chain borrows. The accrued interest is only applied after the collateral check passes, during the update of the stored borrow principal and borrow index. This discrepancy allows users to bypass the intended collateral constraints. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L622)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has an existing cross-chain borrow with a non-zero principal and an outdated borrow index (i.e., interest has accrued but not yet applied).

2. The user submits a new cross-chain borrow request.

3. The `totalBorrowed` value provided by `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` has not updated the interest.

4. This outdated `totalBorrowed` is used in the collateral check without adding accrued interest.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

An attacker with an outstanding cross-chain borrow can issue new borrow requests before accrued interest is updated in the stored borrow principal. Because the collateral check ignores accrued interest, the attacker can borrow beyond their true borrowing power.

### Impact

The protocol may allow borrowing that exceeds the userâ€™s actual collateralization ratio, increasing liquidation risk and potential loss. This can lead to undercollateralized loans and potential financial loss for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before performing the collateral check, accrue interest on the existing cross-chain borrow debt to update the principal, then add the new borrow amount. Use this updated total debt, including accrued interest, to accurately verify collateral sufficiency.
