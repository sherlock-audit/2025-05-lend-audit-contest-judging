# Liquidation Cap Prevents Full Position Closure

### Summary

The lending protocol enforces a static `closeFactorMantissa` of 90%, preventing full (100%) liquidation of undercollateralized positions. This design flaw can lead to residual debt remaining in insolvent accounts, putting the protocol at risk of unrecoverable losses and eventual insolvency.




### Root Cause

The core of the issue lies in the liquidation allowance logic within the [`liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L353) function:

```solidity
uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
    Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), 
    borrowBalance.amount
);

require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
```

Here, `closeFactorMantissa()` defines the maximum proportion of the borrower's outstanding debt that can be repaid in a single liquidation. This value is statically set to 90% (i.e., `0.9e18`). As a result, even when an account is deeply underwater, the liquidation mechanism only permits partial repayment.

This logic ensures the protocol *never* allows more than 90% of the borrow to be repaid, regardless of the health factor or the market situation.

### Impact

* **Residual Insolvency Risk:** Once a position becomes undercollateralized, the protocol cannot fully close it even if economically incentivized. This creates long-lived bad debt that cannot be cleared by the liquidation process.

This issue is especially critical during sharp market downturns or oracle failures, where the inability to fully close positions can cascade into systemic insolvency.

### Mitigation

Apply health factor calculation and allow 100% liquidation before bad debt in order to guarantee solvency.
