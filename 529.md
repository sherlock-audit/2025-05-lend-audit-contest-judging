# Transfers will fail when using USDT

### Summary

Some tokens like USDT doesn't comply with the ERC20 standard and doesn't return `bool` on ERC20 methods. This will make the calls with this token to revert, making it impossible to use them.

### Root Cause

Tokens like USDT on Mainnet doesn't comply with the ERC20 specs, thus will fail when regular transfers are tried to be made with them, resulting in DoS of core functions of the protocol. For example the `CoreRouter::borrow`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/3c97677544cf993c9f7be18d423bd3b5e5a62dd9/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170

```javascript
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

        address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

        ...

        // Borrow tokens
        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

        // Transfer borrowed tokens to the user
@>      IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```

Using USDT here will not comply with the interaface and revert, this is of concern because the borrow function is basically one of the entry-points to the protocol.
