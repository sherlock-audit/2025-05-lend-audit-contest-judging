# Liquidation Check for Deprecated Markets Uses Stale Principal, Preventing Full Debt Repayment

### Summary

In `CoreRouter.sol`'s `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, when a market (`lTokenBorrowed`) is deprecated, {root cause: the check `require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount)` uses `borrowBalance.amount` (the principal recorded at the user's last interaction for that specific same-chain borrow), which does not include subsequently accrued interest}. This will cause an {impact: inability for liquidators to repay the full current outstanding debt (principal + interest) for a borrower in that deprecated market} for {affected party: the LEND protocol and liquidators}. This occurs when {actor: a liquidator attempts to liquidate a position in a deprecated market by repaying the full current debt} as {vulnerability path: `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is called, and if the `repayAmount` (reflecting current total debt with interest) is greater than the stale `borrowBalance.amount` (principal without interest), the check fails, blocking full repayment and potentially leaving unrecoverable accrued interest as bad debt}.


### Root Cause

- In `CoreRouter.sol`, within the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` function, inside the block for deprecated markets:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L339-L341
```solidity
  // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
  if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
      require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow"); // Flaw: borrowBalance.amount is principal at last update, excludes accrued interest
  } else {
      // ...
  }
```
The borrowBalance.amount is fetched from LendStorage and represents the principal amount of the specific lTokenBorrowed debt as recorded at the borrower's last interaction (e.g., borrow, partial repay). It does not reflect any interest that has accrued on this principal since that last update. For deprecated markets, the goal is typically to allow complete winding down of positions, which requires repaying the full current debt, including all accrued interest. This check incorrectly restricts repayAmount to be less than or equal to a potentially stale principal amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `borrower` has an active same-chain borrow position in an LToken market (`lTokenBorrowed`) on the current chain. Their `LendStorage.borrowBalance[borrower][lTokenBorrowed].amount` is `P_old` (principal at last update).
2.  The `LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))` function returns `true`, indicating this market is deprecated.
3.  Interest has accrued on `P_old` for the `borrower` in the `lTokenBorrowed` market, such that their current actual outstanding debt (principal + interest) is `D_current = P_old + Interest_accrued` (where `Interest_accrued > 0`).
4.  The `LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).accrueInterest()` function has been called prior to or at the beginning of the liquidation flow, ensuring `D_current` reflects the up-to-date debt (this is done in `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow` before calling `liquidateBorrowInternal`).


### External Pre-conditions

1.  A `liquidator` identifies the `borrower`'s position in the deprecated market `lTokenBorrowed`. (The overall account may or may not be in shortfall; for deprecated markets, protocols often allow liquidation regardless of overall health to wind down the market).
2.  The `liquidator` attempts to call `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow` (which subsequently calls `liquidateBorrowInternal`, then `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`) with a `repayAmount` equal to `D_current`, intending to repay the full current outstanding debt of the `borrower` in this deprecated market.


### Attack Path

*(This describes a failure path for a legitimate operation due to the bug)*
1.  A specific LToken market, `lTokenDeprecated`, is marked as deprecated by the `lendtroller`.
2.  A `borrower` has an outstanding loan in this `lTokenDeprecated` market. The principal amount recorded in `LendStorage` for this borrow is `P_old` (i.e., `lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenDeprecated).amount` returns `P_old`).
3.  Due to accrued interest since `P_old` was recorded, the borrower's actual current outstanding debt in `lTokenDeprecated` is `D_current = P_old + I`, where `I` is the accrued interest (`I > 0`). (This value would be returned by `lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, lTokenDeprecated)` after interest accrual).
4.  A `liquidator` calls `CoreRouter.liquidateBorrow`, intending to repay the full current debt `D_current` for the `borrower` in the deprecated market `lTokenDeprecated`. The liquidation flow eventually calls `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` with `repayAmount = D_current`. The `borrowBalance.amount` available inside `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` is `P_old`.
5.  Inside `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal`, the `if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenDeprecated)))` condition evaluates to true.
6.  The check `require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");` is executed.
7.  This translates to `require(P_old >= (P_old + I), "Repay > total borrow");`.
8.  Since `I > 0`, the condition `P_old >= (P_old + I)` is false.
9.  The `require` statement fails, and the transaction reverts.
10. The liquidator's attempt to repay the full current debt `D_current` is blocked. The maximum they can repay in this flow for the deprecated market is `P_old`, leaving the accrued interest `I` unpaid and potentially unrecoverable if no other mechanism addresses it.


### Impact

* Liquidators are **prevented from fully repaying a borrower's outstanding debt (which includes principal and all accrued interest) in a deprecated market.** They are incorrectly restricted to repaying only up to the stale principal amount (`borrowBalance.amount`) that was recorded at the borrower's last interaction with that specific borrow.
* This results in **accrued interest being left as unpaid bad debt** for the protocol within these deprecated markets, as the liquidation mechanism does not allow for its full clearance.
* The protocol's ability to cleanly and completely wind down user positions in deprecated markets is significantly impaired, potentially leaving residual risks or orphaned debt.
* Affected Parties: The LEND protocol (suffers from unrecoverable interest which becomes bad debt) and liquidators (cannot perform complete and effective liquidations as intended for deprecated markets, possibly missing out on full liquidation incentives if those are tied to the amount repaid).
