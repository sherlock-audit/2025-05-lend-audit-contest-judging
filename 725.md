# Cross-Chain Liquidation Success Handler Uses Invalid Search Parameters

### Summary

The `_handleLiquidationSuccess` function in CrossChainRouter uses incorrect parameters when searching for cross-chain collateral records. It searches with `srcEid = currentEid (Chain B) `and `destEid = 0`, but the actual records have `srcEid = CHAIN_A_EID` and `destEid = CHAIN_B_EID.` This mismatch can cause the search to fail, preventing liquidation completion and leaving borrowers with seized collateral but unpaid debt.


### Root Cause

A liquidator is supposed to call `liquidateCrossChain` from chainB where the debt exists, afterwards `_handleLiquidationExecute` is called on chainA and if it's successful,  `_handleLiquidationSuccess` is called on chainB, this means The comment of the dev above [`_handleLiquidationSuccess`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L443) is wrong. this means:

The search looks for `{srcEid: CHAIN_B_EID, destEid: 0} `but Chain B actually stores `{srcEid: CHAIN_A_EID, destEid: CHAIN_B_EID}` according to the protocol's design where:

- `srcEid` = The chain ID where the collateral exists (Chain A)
- `destEid` = The chain ID where you receive the borrowed tokens (Chain B)

### Internal Pre-conditions

Cross-chain liquidation must be initiated on Chain B


### External Pre-conditions

User must have underwater cross-chain borrow position


### Attack Path

No attack path, the liquidation will revert and the position will be more underwater.

### Impact

 Incomplete Liquidations Leading to Bad Debt which can have cascading effects towards protocol insolvency

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the search parameters in `_handleLiquidationSuccess`
