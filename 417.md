# Liquidator will be unable to liquidate up to the proper close factor due to incorrect principal amount usage in liquidation calculations

### Summary

The use of principal amount instead of interest-accrued borrowed amount in `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` will cause a significantly reduced maximum liquidation amount calculation for liquidators as the calculation uses the original borrowed principal rather than the current debt including accrued interest, preventing liquidators from liquidating up to the intended close factor

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:352-356`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L352-L356), the `maxClose` calculation uses `borrowBalance.amount` which represents the principal borrowed amount without accrued interest:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L352-L357

`borrowBalance.amount` from `getBorrowBalance()` returns the stored principal amount without applying accrued interest. The close factor should be applied to the current debt including interest, not the original principal similar as done in `LendStorage::getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an existing borrow position with accumulated interest
2. Time needs to pass to allow interest to accrue on the borrow position  
3. Liquidator attempts to liquidate the position using the protocol-calculated maximum repay amount

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User borrows tokens and time passes, allowing interest to accrue
2. User's position becomes liquidatable
3. Liquidator calls `LendStorage::getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount()` which correctly calculates the maximum based on interest-accrued debt
4. Liquidator attempts to liquidate using this calculated amount
5. The `CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` function calculates `maxClose` using only the principal amount, making it much smaller than expected
6. The liquidation fails with "Too much repay" even though the amount should be valid according to the close factor

### Impact

Liquidators cannot liquidate borrowers up to the intended close factor, reducing the effectiveness of the liquidation mechanism. This constrains the protocol's ability to maintain proper collateralization ratios and may lead to bad debt accumulation as liquidators are artificially limited in how much they can repay, especially as interest accrues over time.

### PoC

Add the following test to `TestLiquidations.t.sol` to demonstrate this issue:

```solidity
function test_liquidation_max_close_factor_fails() public {
    address user1 = makeAddr("user1");
    address user2 = makeAddr("user2");

    uint256 supplyAmount = 1000e18;
    address token = supportedTokensA[0];
    address lToken = lendStorageA.underlyingTolToken(token);

    _supplyA(user1, supplyAmount, 0);

    _supplyA(user2, supplyAmount, 0);

    uint256 borrowAmount = (supplyAmount * 750 / 1000) - 1e16;
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    coreRouterA.borrow(borrowAmount, token);

    vm.stopPrank();

    // Attempt liquidation
    vm.startPrank(liquidator);
    ERC20Mock(token).mint(liquidator, borrowAmount);
    IERC20(token).approve(address(coreRouterA), borrowAmount);


    // Advance some blocks to accrue interest
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 300);
    vm.roll(block.number + 300);

    LToken(lToken).accrueInterest();

    (uint256 currentBorrowed, uint256 currentCollateral) =
        lendStorageA.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(user1, LToken(lToken), 0, 0);

    // Collateral > borrowed, healthy position
    assertGt(currentCollateral, currentBorrowed);

    uint256 maxRepayAmount = lendStorageA.getMaxLiquidationRepayAmount(user1, lToken, true);
    console2.log("maxRepayAmount", maxRepayAmount);

    // Liquidation reverts with  Too much repay !!
    coreRouterA.liquidateBorrow(user1, maxRepayAmount, lToken, token);
}
```

Run the test:

```bash
forge test --mt test_liquidation_max_close_factor_fails
```

Output:

```bash
Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/TestLiquidations.t.sol:TestLiquidations
[FAIL: revert: Too much repay] test_liquidation_max_close_factor_fails() (gas: 1295664)
```

### Mitigation

Update the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal()` function to use the interest-accrued `borrowed` amount instead of the principal.
