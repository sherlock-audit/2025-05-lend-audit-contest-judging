# Unfair liquidations can occur

### Summary

Due to wrong check in CoreRouter::liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal() liquidations can happen even if the borrower's position is not underwater

### Root Cause

The calculation of `borrowedAmount` is wrong because `borrowed` can consist of different amounts of borrowed tokens, doing the calculation like this is improper and can lead to unfair liquidations.
```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // Determine borrowIndex and borrowAmount based on chain type
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

        // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
@>              (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

@>          require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");

            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
            uint256 maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
                Exp({mantissa: LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).closeFactorMantissa()}), borrowBalance.amount
            );

            require(repayAmount <= maxClose, "Too much repay");
        }

        return 0;
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. A user supplies 1500 DAI as collateral and can borrow up to 1000 USD worth of value
2. The user borrows 300 USDC
3. Some time passes and user now owes 400 USDC (ratio of global USDC borrow index to his recorded borrow index is 4/3)
4. The user also borrows 500 USDT
5. Even though the user is not underwater (400+500<1000) his USDC position can instantly be liquidated because the wrong calculation makes his `borrowedAmount` equal to 1200 ((400+500)*4/3), and 1200>1000.

### Impact

Unfair liquidations leads to unexpected loss of assets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the calculation and compare `borrowed>collateral` as `borrowed` is the right amount
