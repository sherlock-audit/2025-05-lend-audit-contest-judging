# Liquidators will not be  incentivized to liquidate accounts due to the lack of incentives

### Summary

The protocol lacks economic incentives for liquidators as they receive only market value of collateral minus 2.8% protocol fee, resulting in guaranteed losses that make liquidations unprofitable and prevent bad debt clearance.

### Root Cause

In Core Router contract, there are no incentives for calling the [`liquidateBorrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L230-L244) function. Which is crucial for maintaining the financial health of the system. It is common in defi to provide incentives for liquidators 
```solidity
 /**
     * @notice Liquidates a borrower's position for same chain borrows.
     * @param borrower The address of the borrower
     * @param repayAmount The amount to repay
     * @param lTokenCollateral The address of the collateral lToken
     * @param borrowedAsset The address of the asset that was borrowed
     */
    function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset)        
        external
    {

        
        // The lToken of the borrowed asset
        address borrowedlToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(borrowedAsset);         // @audit - if borrower = liquidator ?

        LTokenInterface(borrowedlToken).accrueInterest();

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(borrower, LToken(payable(borrowedlToken)), 0, 0);

        liquidateBorrowInternal(
            msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed
        );
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Liquidator needs to call `liquidateBorrow()`

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

1. A user becomes undercollateralized when:
```solidity
function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(...) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Borrow position must be underwater
    borrowedAmount = (borrowed * LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex()) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;
    require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");
}
```
2. Liquidator initiates liquidation via liquidateBorrow():
```solidity
function liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount, address lTokenCollateral, address borrowedAsset) external {
    // Validates and calls liquidateBorrowInternal
    liquidateBorrowInternal(msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount, lTokenCollateral, payable(borrowedlToken), collateral, borrowed);
}
```
3. In liquidateSeizeUpdate(), seized collateral is calculated at face value:
```solidity
function liquidateSeizeUpdate(...) internal {
    // Calculate seized tokens with NO bonus
    (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
        .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);

    // Deduct 2.8% protocol fee
    uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA}));
    
    // Liquidator receives: collateral worth repayAmount - 2.8% fee
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
        sender,
        lTokenCollateral,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(sender, lTokenCollateral) + (seizeTokens - currentReward)
    );
}
```
4. Result: Liquidator pays X but receives X - 2.8% in collateral value, making every liquidation unprofitable.

### Impact

The lack of incentives for initiating liquidation poses several risks:
1. Undercollateralized positions remain unliquidated
2. Protocol becomes insolvent as bad debt grows
3. When prices drop, no liquidators step in,  more positions become undercollateralized

### Mitigation

It is advisable to implement incentives for liquidators.
