# User can liquidate himself from another account in order to get rewards and save him from other liquidators taking the reward

### Summary

Users can liquidate themselves if they are able to do so, potentially getting the reward that would have been given to the legitimate liquidators.

Currently in the code, there's a check that prevents the users from liquidating their own positions as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L269), but they can just do it from another address without any worries and leave the legitimate liquidators unable to liquidate his debt.

### Root Cause

Insufficient check as it is very hard to guard the user himself from liquidating his own position

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User takes debt and has his CR at 90%
2. Price drops very fast and he notices that he is liquidatable, so instead of supplying more assets, he just decides to liquidate from another of his addresses in order to not let the other liquidators claim the reward

### Impact

Loss of reward to other liquidators due to the flawed logic
