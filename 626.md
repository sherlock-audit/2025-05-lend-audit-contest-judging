# Incorrect input to `mint()` will cause inaccurate accounting for lToken holders

### Summary

Passing the underlying token amount directly to the [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L77) function will cause inaccurate issuance of lTokens for users as the `CoreRouter` will not correctly track the minted lToken amount returned by the internal mint logic.


### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol`] the `mint(_amount)` call in the `supply()` function uses the underlying token amount directly instead of calculating the actual lToken amount minted from the result of the operation.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User supplies `_amount` of underlying token to the `supply()` function
2. `CoreRouter` calls `LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount)`
3. The result of mint (i.e., actual `mintTokens`) is not tracked for accurate accounting


### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

The user suffers a loss of value due to misaccounting of their supplied tokens. The mismatch may also affect protocol-level reward calculations tied to `lToken` balances. If the logic is reused for accounting/claiming rewards, this can lead to unfair reward distribution or inaccurate total supply metrics.

### Mitigation

```diff
          // Mint lTokens
-        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");

          // Calculate actual minted tokens using exchangeRate from before mint
          uint256 mintTokens = (_amount * 1e18) / exchangeRateBefore;
+        require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(mintTokens) == 0, "Mint failed");
```
