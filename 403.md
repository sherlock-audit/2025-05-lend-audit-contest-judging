# Flawed Refund Logic in Cross-Chain Liquidation Failures

### Summary

During cross chain liquidation failure, the liquidator is refunded without putting in any amount.

### Root Cause

During a successful cross-chain liquidation, the transfer of borrowed tokens from the liquidator to the router occurs within `_handleLiquidationSuccess()`. However, if `_checkLiquidationValid()` fails, the control shifts to `_handleLiquidationFailure()`, which attempts to refund the liquidator. At this stage, no funds have actually been transferred from the liquidator to the router. As a result, the liquidator benefits merely by initiating the liquidation, even though it ultimately fails.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Cross chain borrowing has happened.
2. Liquidator tries to liquidate the borrower and fails.
3. The protocol refunds the liquidator.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Router must have required amount of borrowed asset.

### Attack Path

1. Cross chain borrowing has happened.
2. Liquidator tries to liquidate the borrower and fails.
3. Router has balance of borrowed asset.
4. The protocol refunds the liquidator.

### Impact

By simply initiating a cross-chain liquidation that ultimately fails, a liquidator can unjustly obtain borrowed tokensâ€”up to the maximum value equal to the difference between the collateral value and the borrowed value.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the logic that refunds the liquidator from `_handleLiquidationFailure()`.
