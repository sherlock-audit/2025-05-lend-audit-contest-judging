# Missing Withdrawal Function for Protocol Rewards

### Summary

The protocol collects fees through the `protocolReward` mapping during liquidations, but there is no mechanism to withdraw these accumulated rewards. Protocol fees are permanently locked in the LendStorage contract, preventing the protocol from accessing its rightfully earned revenue.


### Root Cause

The `LendStorage` contract accumulates protocol fees in the `protocolReward` mapping during [`liquidations`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L300):
```javascript
mapping(address lToken => uint256 protocolReward) public protocolReward;

function liquidateSeizeUpdate(...) internal {
    uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));
    
    // Accumulates protocol fees
    lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(lTokenCollateral, lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward);
    
    // ... rest of liquidation logic
}
```
However, no function exists to withdraw these accumulated rewards, making them permanently inaccessible.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol must be operational with liquidations occurring


### External Pre-conditions

Liquidators must execute liquidations that generate protocol fees


### Attack Path

Liquidations are happening
A portion of tokens are stored as rewards for the protocol
The rewards are stuck in the contract


### Impact

Funds will be permanently stuck in the contracts



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a function to withdraw the rewards with the necessary access control
