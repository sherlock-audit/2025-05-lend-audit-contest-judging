# H-01 Double Spend of Collateral in Cross-Chain Borrowing

### Summary

Itâ€™s possible for a user to double-spend their collateral by initiating a cross-chain borrow request and immediately taking out a local loan using the same collateral. This is possible because the collateral is not properly reserved during the cross-chain borrowing process, allowing users to use the same collateral multiple times before the cross-chain transaction is confirmed.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from two design flaws:

1. The collateral is not reserved in the `crossChainBorrows` variable in the `LendStorage` contract until the borrow is fully confirmed through [_handleValidBorrowRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L708). This creates a time window where the collateral appears available for other operations as the cross-chain communication won't be immediate.

2. The collateral availability is only checked once at [_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L622) in the destination chain, but this check becomes stale by the time `_handleValidBorrowRequest` is executed back in the source chain. The system fails to revalidate the collateral availability at the time updating the `crossChainBorrows` back in the source chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The token being borrowed must be available in chain A
2. The token being borrowed must be available in chain B

### External Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have supplied enough collateral for a legit borrow in chain A

### Attack Path

1. User has 1000 USDC as collateral on Chain A
2. User initiates a cross-chain borrow request for 900 USDC on Chain B
3. Before the cross-chain message in Chain B is processed:
   - The collateral is not yet reserved in `crossChainBorrows` in Chain A
4. User immediately takes out a local loan for 900 USDC on Chain A using the same collateral
5. The cross-chain borrow request is later confirmed in `_handleValidBorrowRequest`, increasing the `crossChainBorrows` variable by 900 USDC
6. Result: User has successfully borrowed 1800 USDC (900 cross-chain + 900 local) using only 1000 USDC as collateral, effectively double-spending their collateral

### Impact

- **Severity**: High
- **Financial Impact**: Direct loss of funds through double-spending of collateral
- **Technical Impact**: 
  - Breaks the core collateralization ratio requirements
  - Allows users to borrow more than their collateral should permit
  - May result in protocol insolvency
