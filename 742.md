# Users can bypass the protocol's router and interact directly with the Compound V2 codebase due to a lack of access control

### Attack Path

All users are expected to interact with the protocol through routers (`CoreRouter` and `CrossChainRouter`). Many checks, enforcement, and restrictions are implemented only at the router level.

However, the issue is that any user can bypass those checks, enforcement, and restrictions in the routers by calling the function in the Compound V2 codebase directly. Almost all operations (e.g., mint, redeem, liquidation, borrow) can be called directly in Compound V2 codebase.

The root cause highlighted here is that there is no access control in place to ensure that only the authorized routers can call the Compound V2's function.

```solidity
File: LErc20.sol
53:     function mint(uint256 mintAmount) external override returns (uint256) {
54:         mintInternal(mintAmount);
55:         return NO_ERROR;
56:     }
```

```solidity
File: LErc20.sol
64:     function redeem(uint256 redeemTokens) external override returns (uint256) {
65:         redeemInternal(redeemTokens);
66:         return NO_ERROR;
67:     }
```

This can cause many serious issues and all issues that are caused by this access control issue should be grouped as duplicates. 

### Impact

The user can bypass those checks, enforcement, and restrictions in the routers by calling the function in the Compound V2 codebase directly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict access to the Compound V2 functions to only routers (`CoreRouter` and `CrossChainRouter`).
