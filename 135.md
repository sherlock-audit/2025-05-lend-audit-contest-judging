# A cross-chain user can drain protocol funds by exploiting token decimal mismatches.

### Summary

The protocol does not normalize token amounts for tokens with different decimals (e.g., USDC/USDT with 6 decimals on Ethereum and 18 on BNB Chain), leading to severe accounting errors and potential cross-chain exploits.

### Root Cause

The protocol assumes that tokens like USDC and USDT have the same number of decimals on all supported chains. However, bridged versions on chains like BNB use 18 decimals, while canonical versions on Ethereum use 6. The protocol passes raw token amounts in LayerZero payloads and stores/compares them in storage without converting to a common precision. This results in mismatches where, for example, 1 USDC on Ethereum (1e6) is treated as equal to 1 USDC on BNB (1e18), a 1,000,000x difference.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol does not perform decimal normalization when storing, sending, or comparing token amounts.

### External Pre-conditions

At least one supported token (e.g., USDC or USDT) has different decimals on two or more supported chains (e.g., 6 on Ethereum, 18 on BNB).

### Attack Path

1. User supplies a small amount collateral on BNB so that they can initiate a call to borrow 1 unit of USDC on ETH mainnet(e.g., 1e18 units = 1 USDC on BNB, which uses 18 decimals).
2. User initiates a cross-chain borrow to Ethereum, where USDC uses 6 decimals.
3. Protocol does not normalize decimals and treats 1e18 units on BNB as 1e18 units on Ethereum (which is 1,000,000 USDC).
4. User receives 1,000,000 USDC on Ethereum for only asking 1 USDC.
5. User withdraws or swaps the borrowed USDC on Ethereum, profiting from the decimal mismatch.

### Impact

- Users can over-borrow or under-repay by orders of magnitude.
- Collateralization checks are bypassed, leading to insolvency risk.
- Protocol accounting is corrupted, and funds can be drained or locked.
- Cross-chain liquidations and repayments may be executed with incorrect amounts.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement decimal normalization: convert all token amounts to a common protocol precision (e.g., 18 decimals) before storing, sending, or comparing across chains.
