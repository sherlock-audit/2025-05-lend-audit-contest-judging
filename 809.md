# `supply` and `redeem` uses wrong `exchangeRateStored`

### Summary

The `exchangeRateStored()` function is used to evaluate the the amount of `lToken` to mint to the user during supply and and to take from the user redemption. However due to missing update, the value returned from the function is wrong

### Root Cause

The problem is the the interest is not accrued on the `lToken` before the exchange rate is evaluated and as such a wrong/stale exchange rate is used for the evaluation

```sol

File: Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol
61:     function supply(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
62:         address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

////SNIP
73:         // Get exchange rate before mint
74:   @>    uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();


File: Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol
100:     function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external returns (uint256) {
101:         // Redeem lTokens
102:         address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);

////SNIP 
File: Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol
110:         (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
111:    @>       lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
112:         require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity"); 

114:         // Get exchange rate before redeem
115:   @>    uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();


117:         // Calculate expected underlying tokens
118:  @>     uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
119: 
120:         // Perform redeem
121:         require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).redeem(_amount) == 0, "Redeem failed");
122: 
123:         // Transfer underlying tokens to the user
124:    @>   IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);


```
A look a the `exchangeRateStored()` function shows that it uses the `totalBorrows` in evaluation which in turn is updated when [`LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol#L370) is called

```sol
File: Lend-V2/src/LToken.sol
290:     function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
291:         uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply;
292:         if (_totalSupply == 0) {
293:             /*
294:              * If there are no tokens minted:
295:              *  exchangeRate = initialExchangeRate
296:              */
297:             return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
298:         } else {
299:             /*
300:              * Otherwise:
301:              *  exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalSupply
302:              */
303:             uint256 totalCash = getCashPrior(); // The quantity of underlying owned by this contract
304:     @>      uint256 cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
305:             uint256 exchangeRate = cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale / _totalSupply;
306: 
307:             return exchangeRate;
308:         }
309:     }

```

However due to this missing call, the exchange ratre will be evaluated without including the interest accrued up until the point of supply or redepmtion. thus leading to wrong value of underlying transfered supplier during redemption

PS: also worthy of note is that the evaluation of `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` will not be correct because this is also dependent on the `lToken` interest update

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

`_totalSupply` of `lToken` is greater than zero

### Attack Path

This does not need an attack path as it is a logical flaw described in the Root cause section

### Impact

Wrong exchange rate is used for redemption and supply evaluation and in the case of redemption, more or less underlying tokens will be sent to the supplier.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `CoreRouter::supply()` and `CoreRouter::redeem()` functions as shown below
