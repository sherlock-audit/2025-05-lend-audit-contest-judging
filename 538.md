# Missing Borrow Balance Updates in Cross-Chain Borrows

## Summary
The missing borrow balance update in the `borrowForCrossChain` function will cause a severe accounting failure for the protocol as malicious users will be able to borrow assets cross-chain without their debt being recorded, allowing them to bypass collateral requirements and drain the protocol's liquidity.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol`, the implementation of [borrowForCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest-Sparrow-23/blob/471749b3043a3eca36d78e6d1b3a77aef72a536e/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L195-L205) calls the lToken's `borrow()` function and transfers tokens to the borrower, but critically fails to update the borrow balance in LendStorage. This differs from the regular `borrow()` function which properly updates storage with new debt positions.

```solidity
function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
    external
{
    require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");
    require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");
    
    // Missing interest accrual
    
    require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");
    
    // Missing borrow balance update in LendStorage
    // Missing user borrowed asset tracking
    // Missing LEND rewards distribution
    
    IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
}
```

## Internal pre-conditions
1. Protocol must be deployed with CoreRouter and CrossChainRouter properly configured
2. CrossChainRouter must be set as the only authorized caller of `borrowForCrossChain`
3. User must have sufficient collateral on the source chain to initiate a cross-chain borrow
4. The destination chain must have sufficient liquidity in the target market

## External pre-conditions
1. LayerZero cross-chain messaging system must be operational between chains
2. Gas price must be reasonable for cross-chain operations to complete
3. No network congestion that would prevent cross-chain messages from being delivered

## Attack Path
1. Attacker supplies minimum collateral on Chain A (source chain)
2. Attacker initiates a cross-chain borrow request for a large amount of tokens on Chain B
3. CrossChainRouter on Chain B receives the message and calls `borrowForCrossChain` on CoreRouter
4. CoreRouter executes the borrow and transfers tokens to the attacker
5. The protocol fails to record the borrow in LendStorage, resulting in no debt tracking
6. Attacker can repeat this process until all liquidity is drained
7. Since no debt is recorded, the attacker cannot be liquidated and has no obligation to repay
8. The protocol becomes insolvent as lenders cannot withdraw their supplied assets

## Impact
The protocol suffers a critical loss of funds up to the total value locked across all destination chains. Liquidity providers lose their deposits as borrowed funds cannot be recovered due to missing debt records. The entire cross-chain borrowing mechanism becomes exploitable, rendering the protocol's risk management ineffective.

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
// Test case showing the accounting failure
function testBorrowForCrossChainUpdatesBorrowBalance() public {
    // Arrange
    uint256 borrowAmount = 100e18;
    address borrower = user1;
    
    // Mint tokens to the CoreRouter contract
    testToken.mint(address(coreRouter), borrowAmount * 2);
    
    // Get initial borrow balance
    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory prevState = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lToken);
    
    // Act - Call borrowForCrossChain
    vm.prank(address(crossChainRouter));
    coreRouter.borrowForCrossChain(
        borrower,
        borrowAmount,
        lToken,
        address(testToken)
    );
    
    // Assert - Check that the borrow balance was updated
    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory newState = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lToken);
    assertEq(newState.amount, prevState.amount + borrowAmount, "Borrow amount should be increased by the requested amount");
    assertGt(newState.borrowIndex, 0, "Borrow index should be greater than 0");
    
    // Verify the tokens were transferred to the borrower
    assertEq(testToken.balanceOf(borrower), borrowAmount, "Borrower should receive the borrowed tokens");
    assertEq(testToken.balanceOf(address(coreRouter)), borrowAmount, "CoreRouter should have the remaining tokens");
}
```

## Test Log
```solidity
[FAIL: Borrow amount should be increased by the requested amount: 0 != 100000000000000000000]
testBorrowForCrossChainUpdatesBorrowBalance() (gas: 65836)
```

## Mitigation

**To fully mitigate this issue:**

1. **Update the `borrowForCrossChain` function** to ensure it mirrors the accounting logic of the regular `borrow` function. Specifically, after a successful borrow, the protocol must:
   - Accrue interest on the lToken
   - Retrieve the current borrow state from LendStorage
   - Calculate the new borrow amount and update the borrow index
   - Call `lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance()` with the correct parameters
   - Call `lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset()` to track the user's borrowed asset
   - Call `lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend()` to distribute rewards (if applicable)
