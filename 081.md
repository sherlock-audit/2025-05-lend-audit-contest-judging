# Cross-Chain Liquidation Allows Collateral Theft Without Debt Repayment

### Summary

In a cross-chain liquidation, the collateral is transferred before confirming repayment of the borrower's debt. The debt repayment occurs in a final message after the collateral transfer, which can be easily bypassed by a malicious liquidator. This allows an attacker to steal collateral without repaying the borrow.



### Root Cause

The liquidation process is split across chains:

-  Liqudation request created on destination chain and sent to source
- Collateral is seized and transferred to the liquidator on the source chain.
- A follow-up message is sent to the destination chain to execute the repayment of debt.

However, the protocol does not enforce atomicity between the collateral seizure and debt repayment. If the liquidator has insufficient funds or zero allowance on the destination chain, the repayment fails â€” after the collateral is already transferred.

```solidity
 function _handleLiquidationExecute(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        /...

        // Update total investment for borrower
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            payload.sender,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) - payload.amount
        );

        // Update total investment for liquidator
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
        );

        // Clear user supplied asset if total investment is 0
        if (lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) == 0) {
            lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(payload.sender, payload.destlToken);
        }

   

        _send(
            srcEid,
            payload.amount,
            0,
            0,
            payload.sender,
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.srcToken,
            ContractType.LiquidationSuccess
        );
    }

  //@audit handles repayment after collateral transfer
    function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {

}

### Internal Pre-conditions

A cross-chain liquidation is initiated.
The borrower is undercollateralized.
The protocol proceeds with seizing collateral on the source chain.
Debt repayment is triggered after collateral is seized.



### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. Attacker (malicious liquidator) triggers liquidation with a valid borrow undercollateralization.
2. Source chain seizes the borrower's collateral and transfers it to the attacker.
3. A message is sent to the destination chain to repay the debt.
4. On the destination chain:
The attacker has no token balance or has set allowance to 0 for the contract.
5. Repayment fails silently or reverts.
6. Attacker keeps the seized collateral without repaying any debt.

### Impact

 Liquidators can extract user assets without payment.
The system ends up with unrepayable debt while losing reserves.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder the logic so that debt repayment amount is locked  first, and only upon success is the collateral transferred.
