# Incorrect Borrow Adjustment in Liquidation Check Causes Unfair Liquidations

### Summary

Incorrect adjustment of already interest-adjusted total borrow will cause unfair liquidations for users as the protocol will multiply total borrow (already interest-included) with borrowIndex again, resulting in an inflated value that triggers liquidation conditions unnecessarily.

### Root Cause

The borrowed value passed to liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal is already the sum of all user debts including interest (computed by getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral). However, it is further adjusted using:
`borrowedAmount = (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;`

This mistakenly re-applies an interest-based adjustment to a value that already includes interest, causing an overestimated debt calculation. Additionally, since borrowed includes multiple borrowed assets (same-chain and cross-chain), applying the index of a single market is incorrect and misleading.


```solidity
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // Determine borrowIndex and borrowAmount based on chain type
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory borrowBalance = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(borrower, lTokenBorrowed);

        // Allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated
        if (LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).isDeprecated(LToken(lTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(borrowBalance.amount >= repayAmount, "Repay > total borrow");
        } else {
            // The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable
            uint256 borrowedAmount;

            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;

            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall");


```

### Internal Pre-conditions

User should borrow some tokens and needs to be closed to liquidation level
Borrow interest shouldn't  be updated for user until liquidation happens

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. A user has borrowed multiple assets (e.g., USDC on one chain and ETH on another).
2. The user’s actual health is safe — their collateral exceeds total borrow.
3. Due to incorrect calculation in liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal, the system computes borrowedAmount using a borrowIndex multiplication that already existed in the returned value.
4. The protocol incorrectly believes the user is undercollateralized and allows liquidation.

### Impact

 Users may get liquidated even when their actual debt is sufficiently collateralized

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Borrowed amount should be compared direclty with colelteral no adjustment needed
