# Inadequate ETH Balance Verification in Cross-Chain Borrowing



## Finding description and impact

The `borrowCrossChain` function lacks proper validation to ensure the contract holds sufficient ETH to fulfill the requested borrow amount (`_amount`). 

This validation is essential when ETH serves as the borrowed asset. The absence of this check may cause the function to attempt borrowing amounts exceeding the contract's actual ETH holdings, potentially causing downstream failures or cross-chain state inconsistencies.

## Code snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L113-L154

**Root cause:**

The existing balance validation only checks for non-zero balance:
```solidity
require(address(this).balance > 0, "Out of money");
```

This inadequate check permits execution even when `_amount > address(this).balance`, creating potential failure conditions.

**Impact:**

* Cross-chain borrow operations may fail unexpectedly or exhibit undefined behavior on destination chains
* Risk of incomplete transfers or cross-chain state synchronization issues
* User experience degradation due to failed transactions or locked funds from partial execution

## Mitigation

Strengthen the balance validation with a comprehensive check:

```solidity
require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "Insufficient contract balance for borrow");
```

This modification ensures the contract possesses adequate ETH reserves to complete the requested borrow operation before initiating cross-chain communication.
