# CoreRouter will require excessive collateral from borrowers

### Summary

A double-counting of accrued interest in the borrow function will cause an incorrect collateral requirement for borrowers as the `CoreRouter` applies the borrow index calculation twice to the same value.

### Root Cause

In [`CoreRouter.sol:157-159`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L157) there is a double application of the borrow index calculation. The `borrowed` variable from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` already includes accrued interest through `borrowWithInterestSame()`, but the code applies the borrow index calculation again, effectively doubling the interest calculation.

```solidity
 uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
            ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
            : 0;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an existing borrow position to have a non-zero `currentBorrow.borrowIndex`
2. User needs to attempt to borrow additional tokens while having an existing position


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has an existing borrow position with accrued interest
2. User attempts to borrow additional tokens
3. CoreRouter calculates hypothetical account liquidity using `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`
4. CoreRouter incorrectly applies borrow index calculation again to the already interest-adjusted borrowed amount
5. User's collateral requirement is artificially inflated due to double-counted interest

### Impact

The borrowers suffer from incorrect collateral requirements as they are required to provide significantly more collateral than mathematically necessary. This could prevent legitimate borrowing operations or cause incorrect liquidations. The protocol's core borrowing functionality is affected, potentially leading to:
- Users being unable to borrow even with sufficient collateral
- Incorrect collateral requirements
- Potential liquidation issues due to incorrect borrow amount calculations

### PoC

1. Alice has an existing borrow position of 1000 tokens with 10% accrued interest (1100 tokens total)
2. Alice attempts to borrow additional tokens
3. The protocol first calculates her existing borrow with interest through `borrowWithInterestSame()` (1100 tokens)
4. The protocol then incorrectly applies the interest calculation again to this amount
5. This results in Alice's borrow being calculated as 1210 tokens (1100 * 1.1) instead of the correct 1100 tokens
6. Alice is now required to provide collateral for 1210 tokens worth of debt instead of the actual 1100 tokens
7. This artificial inflation of her debt could prevent her from borrowing more or make her position liquidatable when it shouldn't be


### Mitigation

The protocol should remove the redundant interest calculation in the borrow function. Since the borrowed amount from `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` already includes accrued interest through `borrowWithInterestSame()`, there is no need to apply the borrow index calculation again. The protocol should use the borrowed amount directly without any additional interest calculations.
