# Incorrect `srcEid` check in `borrowWithInterest()`

### Summary

NOTE: This is a different issue from the one in the same function involving the line `if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid)`. That issue concerns chain B, where repayments happen. The issue described here is about the other if statement, which affects chain A, where borrows originate.

`LendStorage.sol#borrowWithInterest()` incorrectly checks `borrows[i].srcEid == currentEid` on the source chain (Chain A), but borrow records store destEid as the current chain ID. This causes the function to always return zero for existing cross-chain borrows on Chain A.

### Root Cause

`LeadStorage.sol#borrowWithInterest()` uses the wrong chain ID field for filtering borrows on the source chain. It checks if `srcEid == currentEid`, which does not match how borrow records are stored. This condition will never be true on chain A (where `userBorrows` exist) because the borrowâ€™s `destEid`  (not `srcEid`) equals the current chain ID. This mismatch causes the function to ignore valid borrows.

When a borrow is stored in `userBorrows`, the `srcEid` is set as Chain B and the `destEid` as Chain A. This happens on Chain A and can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L722). In this scenario, `srcEid` corresponds to Chain B while `currentEid` refers to Chain A.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Calling `borrowWithInterest()` on chain A will always return 0, making cross-chain liquidations impossible. Since `_checkLiquidationValid` is called on chain A, it sees the borrowed amount as zero and incorrectly determines the position is not liquidatable.
