# Due to lack of collateral-borrow validations in the cross-chain liquidation, unnecessary liquidations can occue

### Summary

when a cross-chain liquidation is initiated in the `CrossChainRouter` using the `liquidateCrossChain`(note- this is called on chain B where the debt exists) the function calls some internal functions like - `_validateAndPrepareLiquidation` and `_executeLiquidation` and then these 2 also calls some functions internally performing validations and all, mostly whats done is that the maxLiquidation amount is checked and how much should be repayment final amount which I wont go into details about here, so after all this caculations, validations and updates the payload this sent via the `_send` function that is called by the [_executeLiquidationCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L264C3-L274C15). So up until here the execution was on the chain B.

Now when when the chain A where the collateral exists, receives the payload that was sent via `_send` - it is checked that if the liquidation is valid or not via the `_checkLiquidationValid` function. This is done on the chain A as thats where the collateral is existing for seizing. Now the issue lies in this function as the function returns the borrowed amount and the collateral via this [getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L432) after the return the function in the end is supposed to return a bool and it does that i.e true if the borrowed > collateral and false otherwise. Now even though this is returned, the issue however is that there is no validation or any check for this is done before the liquidation executes and seize the user's collateral on the source chain. This is pretty bad because the user can even get liquidated even when he is not below the threshold, like his value of the collateral is still up. After this the `_handleLiquidationSuccess` will execute straight up without any checks and the collateral will end up getting seized.

Note that this validation isnt done anywhere in case of the cross chain liquidations. In contrast to this in case of the same chain- there is a require statement presented before anything executes [see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L350) This protects the user from getting liquidated for no reason on the same chain, but this is not presented in the cross-chain liquidations

### Root Cause

Even though the `_checkLiquidationValid` function returns the collateral vs borrow bool, theres no validation done for this like it is done in the same chain liquidations in the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` before the liquidation executes

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users borrow using cross-chain borrows

### External Pre-conditions

A liquidator liquidating the cross chain borrow

### Attack Path

Suppose a borrower borrows some amount of tokens using the cross chain borrow
A malicious liquidator notices the aforementioned issue, and calls the `liquidateCrossChain` on the borrower even when the borrower's collateral > borrow
due to the lack of checks and validations the borrower will end up getting liquidated and his collateral seized

### Impact

High impact - Loss of funds for the users who borrow using the cross chain functionality. 
Even if the borrower's collateral > borrowedAmount, his collateral will end up seized

### PoC

Below is the snippet of the same chain liquidations where there is require statement for checking the collateral and borrows
```solidity
     * @return uint An error code (0 if no error)
     */
    function liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal(
        address payable lTokenBorrowed,
        address borrower,
        uint256 repayAmount,
        uint256 collateral,
        uint256 borrowed
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {

// SNIP ...


            // For same-chain liquidations, calculate borrowed amount using the borrowBalance's index
            borrowedAmount =
                (borrowed * uint256(LTokenInterface(lTokenBorrowed).borrowIndex())) / borrowBalance.borrowIndex;


            require(borrowedAmount > collateral, "Insufficient shortfall"); //<- this doesnt exist in case of cross chain
```
Now below is the cross chain case:
```solidity
    /**
     * Checked on chain A (source chain), as that's where the collateral exists.
     */
    function _checkLiquidationValid(LZPayload memory payload) private view returns (bool) {
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );
        return borrowed > collateral; // AUDIT- so this just returns the bool, but shoudlnt there also be a require or if statement like its done in the former
    }
```

### Mitigation

Enforce the validation using the `require` statement just like it is done in the `liquidateBorrowAllowedInternal` in case of same chain liquidations
