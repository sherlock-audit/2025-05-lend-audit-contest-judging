# Unchecked transfers before state change, could lead to loss of funds

### Summary

The functions `redeem`,` borrow`, and `borrowForCrossChain` in the `CoreRouter` contract perform ERC20 `transfer` operations to users before updating critical protocol state (such as balances or investment records). If the ERC20 transfer fails, the function will not revert, so any state changes made after the transfer will persist.

For example, on the `redeem` function, lets say a user wants to redeem their full amount of `lTokens for the underlying collateral. If the transfer of the `underlyingToken` to the redeemer fails, the `lendStorage` will update the state as if the transfer was successful making their underlying collateral unclaimable. 

Similar issues can occur on `borrow` and `borrowForCrossChain` where there are unchecked transfers.

### Root Cause

`redeem`,` borrow`, and `borrowForCrossChain` in the `CoreRouter` use unchecked transfers

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. User Initiates Redeem
2. Redeem Logic Executes
3. Transfer Fails Silently
4. State Updates Proceed
5. User Cannot Claim Collateral
6. Protocol State Is Inconsistent

The same sequence can occur in `borrow` and `borrowForCrossChain`, where the protocol updates borrow records after an unchecked transfer that may have failed, leading to loss of funds or incorrect borrow balances.

### Impact

The user does not receive their underlying tokens, but their protocol state is updated as if they did. Their collateral is now unclaimable, they have lost access to their funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. SafeERC20.safeTransfer to revert functions with failed transfers
2. Check the return value of `transfer` and revert if not successful
