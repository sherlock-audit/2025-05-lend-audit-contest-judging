# Cross-Chain Data Structure Invariant Violation Enables Double Debt Counting

### Summary

The `borrowWithInterest` function contains logic that processes `crossChainCollaterals` entries where both `srcEid` and `destEid` equal the current chain ID, treating them as local chain debt. However, this violates the protocol's cross-chain data structure invariant where local chain borrows should be tracked in `borrowBalance` mapping, not in cross-chain mappings. Another issue is that if for anyreason we have a borrow in `crossChainCollaterals` with `srcEid` and `destEid` equal the current chain ID, then the equivalent will be in `crossChainBorrows`. this means we're double counting this debt.

### Root Cause

In [`borrowWithInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/LendStorage.sol#L495-L499) the function processes collaterals where both source and destination chains are the current chain:
```javascript
} else {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < collaterals.length; i++) {
        if (collaterals[i].destEid == currentEid && collaterals[i].srcEid == currentEid) {
            borrowedAmount += (collaterals[i].principle * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / collaterals[i].borrowIndex;
        }
    }
}
```
This condition suggest that the whole process was generated locally this means there's for sure the same borrow in `crossChainBorrows`, this means we're double counting, plus it shouldn't be possible anyway to have this, same chain debts should be tracked in `borrowBalance`


### Internal Pre-conditions

User must have same-chain borrow that gets stored in crossChainCollaterals mapping


### External Pre-conditions

Protocol deployment with cross-chain functionality enabled


### Attack Path

User borrows cross-chain: Chain A â†’ Chain A for $5,000 USDC
Chain A records: crossChainBorrows[user][USDC] = [{principle: 5000, ...}]
Chain B records: crossChainCollaterals[user][USDC] = [{principle: 5000, ...}]

 if such debt is possible to exist, as the only way is to go through the whole `borrowcrossChain` flow, the user will have the same debt in `crossChainBorrows`, the user cannot borrow up to their actual capacity due to inflated debt.

### Impact
