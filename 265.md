# Failure to Accrue Interest in supply() and redeem() May Lead to Inaccurate Accounting

### Summary

From the README of the protocol, it states that it builds on the Compound V2 protocol:

### Q: Additional audit information. 
Builds on top of Compound V2.

The contracts inherit and replicate much of Compound’s architecture. Notable examples are the [`CoreRouter.borrow,`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L140-L190) [`CoreRouter.repayBorrow,`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L207-L221) [`CoreRouter.redeem,`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L94-L138) and [`CoreRouter.supply`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L56-L92) functions — each facilitating borrowing, repaying, redeeming, and supplying (i.e., minting) functionality.

According to the [Compound V2 documentation](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=Interest%20accrues%20to,aforementioned%20methods%20invoked.), interest accrues when any of these four functions are successfully invoked, as each call triggers the accrueInterest() method. This ensures that interest is compounded for the current and any missed blocks before balances are updated or funds are moved.

In the implementation of this protocol:

Both CoreRouter.borrow and CoreRouter.repayBorrow correctly call `LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();` before proceeding, ensuring interest is up to date.

However, CoreRouter.supply and CoreRouter.redeem omit this call, even though they mirror the behavior of [Compound’s mint](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=I%20transfer%20cTokens%3F-,Mint,the%20underlying%20tokens%20supplied%2C%20divided%20by%20the%20current%20Exchange%20Rate.,-CErc20) and redeem methods, respectively. since both functions uses the `exchageRateStored()` which relies on the interest rate accrue in its mathematical formular.
`exchangeRate = (getCash() + totalBorrows() - totalReserves()) / totalSupply()`  [exchangeRate](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#exchange-rate:~:text=TRANSFER_TOO_MUCH-,Exchange%20Rate,exchangeRate%20%3D%20(getCash()%20%2B%20totalBorrows()%20%2D%20totalReserves())%20/%20totalSupply(),-CErc20%20/%20CEther) this will result in a stale exchange rate being used and cause a user to receive more `lTokens` when supplying.
Note according to the [compound V2](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L279-L286) protocol calling the `exchangeRateStored` does not accrue interest.

### Root Cause

In both CoreRouter.supply and CoreRouter.redeem` interest is not called..

            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(_lToken), _amount, 0);
        require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient liquidity");


        // Get exchange rate before redeem
        uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();


        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;


        // Perform redeem

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

Always happens

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits/supply on Lend ie supply 1 ether. (no interest accrue)
2. time passed Bob borrows from pool which alice supplies ether. (causes interest to be added to the underlying balance of every supplier and borrower in the market).
3. Bob repays borrows (causes interest to be added to the underlying balance of every supplier and borrower in the market)
4. Alice decides to redeem (no interest accrues only interest accrued during borrowing and repaying are added)

### Impact

Interest accrued during periods when other users supply or redeem assets from the pool is not correctly reflected in the underlying balances of all suppliers and borrowers. As time progresses, this results in a silent but compounding loss of value across the market, eroding user balances and creating systemic inaccuracies.

### PoC

_No response_


### Mitigation

Call the `LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();` on both the `CoreRouter.supply` and `CoreRouter.redeem` function
