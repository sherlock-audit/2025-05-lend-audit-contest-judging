# Inaccurate Borrow Amount Calculation in Cross-Chain Borrowing

### Summary

The current calculation of the borrow amount in the `borrowCrossChain()` function does not accurately account for existing borrowings when there is a non-zero borrow index. 




### Root Cause

In the `CrossChainRouter` contract, the `borrowCrossChain()` function includes a collateral sufficiency check to ensure that the user's collateral on the source chain is adequate to cover their total borrowing across chains.

```solidity
        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );

        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
        require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
```

However, the calculation of the borrow amount does not accurately account for existing borrowings when there is a non-zero borrow index. This can lead to an inaccurate assessment of the user's borrowing capacity, potentially allowing users to borrow more than their collateral can support.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The borrow amount is calculated without adjusting for the current borrow index when there is an existing borrow position. This can lead to an underestimation of the user's total borrowing amount and allow user to borrow than the allowed. 

### Impact

Users may be able to borrow more than their collateral can support, increasing the risk of default and potential financial instability within the lending protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `borrowCrossChain()` function to use the corrected calculation for the borrow amount, ensuring that it accurately reflects the user's total borrowing, including existing debt.

```diff
        // Get existing borrow amount
        (uint256 totalBorrowed,) = lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(
            payload.sender, LToken(payable(payload.destlToken)), 0, payload.amount
        );

+      uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
+       ? ((borrowed * currentBorrowIndex) / userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex)
+       : 0;

        // Verify the collateral from source chain is sufficient for total borrowed amount
-       require(payload.collateral >= totalBorrowed, "Insufficient collateral");
+       require(payload.collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
