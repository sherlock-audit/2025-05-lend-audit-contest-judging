# [M-1] Double Interest Application in borrow() Leads to Over-Collateralization Requirement and False Liquidation Risk

### Summary

The protocol’s `borrow()` function incorrectly applies interest twice when calculating a user's debt for collateral checks. This causes the system to demand excessive collateral , even when the borrower is solvent. As a result, users are either blocked from borrowing or subjected to false liquidation risk due to an inflated debt value.

### Root Cause

1) The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` function already includes accrued interest on existing borrows:
```solidity
totalBorrow = borrowWithInterestSame(...) + borrowWithInterest(...);
```

These functions scale the stored principal by the current borrow index:
```solidity
(principal * currentBorrowIndex) / userBorrowIndex;
```

2) However, in `borrow()`, the calculated borrowed amount (which includes accrued interest) is then re-scaled using the same borrow index:
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex);
```

This results in double application of interest , effectively compounding the debt before checking against collateral.

### Internal Pre-conditions

> The user must have previously borrowed from the market.
> The market must have accrued interest since the last borrow (i.e., borrowIndex > 0 and currentBorrow.borrowIndex != borrowIndex).

### External Pre-conditions

> The user attempts to borrow additional funds.
> The user has sufficient actual collateral to support the real debt (including accrued interest), but not enough to cover the double-applied interest .

### Attack Path

> Victim Supplies Collateral:
Alice supplies 1000 DAI as collateral.

> Initial Borrow:
She borrows 100 DAI at `borrowIndex` = 1e18.

> Interest Accrual:
After time passes, the borrow index increases to 1.1e18. Her debt becomes:
```markdown
100 * 1.1e18 / 1e18 = 110 DAI
```

> New Borrow Attempt:
Alice tries to borrow an additional 50 DAI.

> Protocol Calculates Debt with Double Interest:
```markdown
borrowed = 110 (existing) + 50 (new) = 160
```

> Then re-applies the current borrow index:
```markdown
borrowAmount = (160 * 1.1e18) / 1e18 = 176 DAI
```

> Collateral Check Fails:
Even though Alice has 1000 DAI collateral, the system requires her to have ≥176 DAI available.
But she only needs 160 DAI to be safe — this false requirement blocks her borrow.

> False Liquidation Risk:
If another actor manipulates the borrow index via flash loan or oracle manipulation, the victim can appear undercollateralized and be liquidated despite being solvent .

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Experience**        | Users are unfairly denied access to their own capital due to an inflated debt requirement. Even solvent users may be blocked from borrowing, leading to frustration and loss of trust in the protocol.           |
| **Capital Efficiency**     | The system forces users to lock up more collateral than necessary, reducing the amount of usable liquidity in the market and lowering overall capital efficiency for both borrowers and suppliers.         |



### PoC

Add this to the TestBorrowing.t.sol:

```solidity
function test_double_interest_application_on_borrow() public {
        // Bound the supply and initial borrow amounts
        uint256 supplyAmount = 1000e18; // 1000 DAI (assuming 18 decimals)
        uint256 initialBorrowAmount = 100e18; // 100 DAI

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // Step 1: Supply collateral
        (address token, address lToken) = _supply(supplyAmount);

        // Step 2: Initial borrow
        coreRouter.borrow(initialBorrowAmount, token);

        // Step 3: Accrue interest by advancing blocks
        vm.roll(100); // Fast-forward 100 blocks
        LTokenInterface(lToken).accrueInterest();

        // Step 4: Prepare for second borrow
        uint256 newBorrowAmount = 50e18; // 50 DAI

        // Step 5: Get current borrow state
        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(deployer, lToken);
        uint256 currentBorrowIndex = LTokenInterface(lToken).borrowIndex();

        // Step 6: Manually calculate expected debt with single interest application
        uint256 expectedExistingDebt = (currentBorrow.amount * currentBorrowIndex) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex;
        uint256 expectedTotalDebt = expectedExistingDebt + newBorrowAmount;

        // Step 7: Get actual collateral requirement from protocol
        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) = 
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(deployer, LToken(payable(lToken)), 0, newBorrowAmount);

        uint256 flawedTotalDebt = 
            (borrowed * currentBorrowIndex) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex;

        // Step 8: Assert double interest application
        assertTrue(
            flawedTotalDebt > expectedTotalDebt,
            "Collateral requirement should exceed actual debt due to double interest"
        );

        // Step 9: Show the difference
        uint256 interestDelta = flawedTotalDebt - expectedTotalDebt;

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

> Use 'borrowed' directly because it already includes accrued interest

```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
        ..................

        (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
            lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount); 

        LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken); 

 --     uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
             ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) 
            : 0; 

  ++    // Use 'borrowed' directly because it already includes accrued interest
         require(collateral >= borrowed, "Insufficient collateral");

        .....................
    }
```
