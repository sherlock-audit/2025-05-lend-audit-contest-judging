# Hardcoded sender address for cross-chain operations results in loss of tokens

**Description:** 

During [CrossChainRouter::borrowCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L148) & [CrossChainRouter::liquidateCrossChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L281) call `_send`function which makes use of `_lzSend` to send a LayerZero message to destination chain. For both operations, the sender that gets to be part of payload is a hardcoded  `msg.sender` address,

```bash
    // Send message to destination chain with verified sender
    // borrowIndex of 0 initially - will be set correctly on dest chain
    _send(
        _destEid,
        _amount,
        0, // Initial borrowIndex, will be set on dest chain
        collateral,
@>      msg.sender, // @audit hardcoded address is a problem!!!
        destLToken,
        address(0), // liquidator
        _borrowToken,
        ContractType.BorrowCrossChain
    );

```

A smart wallet is deployed in one chain and has a specific address. It's possible that the same address on destination chain belongs to someone else. That's an issue here because the cross-chain operations happen against the payload.sender which is hardcoded to msg.sender. For instance, in `CoreRouter::borrowForCrossChain`, underlying tokens are lent directly to payload.sender,

```javascript
    // The _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest calls borrowForCrossChain, providing payload.sender as _borrower
    CoreRouter(coreRouter).borrowForCrossChain(payload.sender, payload.amount, payload.destlToken, destUnderlying);

    function borrowForCrossChain(address _borrower, uint256 _amount, address _destlToken, address _destUnderlying)
        external
    {
        require(crossChainRouter != address(0), "CrossChainRouter not set");


        require(msg.sender == crossChainRouter, "Access Denied");

        require(LErc20Interface(_destlToken).borrow(_amount) == 0, "Borrow failed");

@>      IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
    }
```

This means the underlying are transferred to an unknown address. Once transferred, on the source chain, a borrow record is added against their address on the source chain,

```bash

    // Add new borrow record (source chain)
    lendStorage.addCrossChainBorrow(
        payload.sender,
        payload.srcToken,
        LendStorage.Borrow(
            srcEid, currentEid, payload.amount, payload.borrowIndex, payload.destlToken, payload.srcToken
        )
    );

```

This means, the tokens they tried to borrow from the protocol are essentially lost & they'd have to pay back the amount they did not even receive in order to cover the shortfall. This can be catastrophic if the address on destination chain belongs to someone who has interacted with the protocol; they could get liquidated because of this.


It's even worse when liquidator liquidates someone cross-chain,

```bash

    // Send message to Chain A to execute the seize
    _send(
        params.srcEid,
        seizeTokens,
        params.storedBorrowIndex,
        0,
        params.borrower,
        lendStorage.crossChainLTokenMap(params.lTokenToSeize, params.srcEid), // Convert to Chain A version before sending
@>      msg.sender, // @audit liquidator address hardcoded
        params.borrowedAsset,
        ContractType.CrossChainLiquidationExecute
    );

```

On the dst chain, totalInvestment is updated for payload.liquidator which will most probably be a different address on destination chain,

```javascript

        // Update total investment for liquidator
    lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
@>      payload.liquidator, // @audit Ownership of this could be different than the liquidator on src chain
        payload.destlToken,
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
    );

```

Not only is the liquidator losing their tokens, but they aren't even compensated. This liquidator on different chain can always redeem these `free` tokens that are erroneously credited to them.

**Impact:** 

Loss of tokens for borrowers & liquidators.

**Proof of Concept:**

Here's is a borrow scenario (similar scenario for cross-chain liquidations)

1. Alice initiates a cross-chain transaction using `borrowForCrossChain` to borrow DAI on chainB.
2. The `borrowForCrossChain` calls `_send`, providing `msg.sender` as borrower.
3. This becomes part of the payload as payload._sender, and is sent to chainB where `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` gets called.
4. The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` calls `borrowForCrossChain` which transfers requested underlying to payload.sender.
5. On chainB, `payload.sender` belongs to Jack, not alice so underlying are erroneously transferred to Jack.
6. The `addCrossChainCollateral` or `updateCrossChainCollateral` gets called on `LendStorage` and record is added against Jack.
7. The `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` sends confirmation back to source chain with updated borrow details.
8. Here on source-chain, payload.sender is alice so borrow record is added for alice.
9. Now, a borrow record exists for Alice on source chain and for Jack on destination chain.
10. Jack has been interacting with protocol, and because of alice's transaction, their borrow value goes > collateral value.
11. Jack gets liquidated unfairly.
12. Now, alice has to pay back tokens she did not receive. 

It's a loss for everyone. 

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Instead of using hardcoding msg.sender, the function should provide address given by the user. In addition, Users must cryptographically prove they control the destination address so they don't misuse the feature (provide someone's address so they get liquidated).
