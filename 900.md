# Underestimated Debt After Local Repayment Ignoring Cross-Chain Borrows

## Summary
The removal of a borrowed asset from `userBorrowedAssets` during full local loan repayment without checking for cross-chain borrows causes `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to underestimate the user’s total debt, enabling borrowing beyond collateral limits and allowing users to default with excess loans, resulting in catastrophic protocol loss.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol`, when a local loan is fully repaid, `lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset` removes the token from `userBorrowedAssets` without verifying if it is still borrowed cross-chain (recorded in `addCrossChainBorrow`). The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function iterates over `userBorrowedAssets` to calculate debt, missing cross-chain borrows for removed tokens.

```solidity
        // Update same-chain borrow balances
        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);//audit
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
                borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
            );
        }
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The user needs to have sufficient collateral on Chain A (e.g., $1000 USDC in an lToken pool with a 75% collateral factor).
2. The user needs to have a small local loan (e.g., 10 USDC) and a significant cross-chain loan (e.g., 740 USDC) for the same token (e.g., cUSDC) on Chain B.
3. The lToken pool on Chain A needs to have sufficient liquidity to process new borrow requests.
4. The user must fully repay the local loan to trigger `removeUserBorrowedAsset`.

## External Pre-conditions
1. The underlying token prices (e.g., USDC) need to remain stable to ensure consistent collateral and borrow valuations.
2. The LayerZero V2 network needs to process cross-chain borrow requests correctly to establish the cross-chain loan.
3. The oracle price feed for lTokens needs to be consistent to avoid unrelated reverts.

## Attack Path
1. A user supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A in an lToken pool (e.g., cUSDC).
2. The user borrows 10 USDC locally on Chain A, registering cUSDC in `userBorrowedAssets` and `updateBorrowBalance`.
3. The user borrows 740 USDC cross-chain on Chain B for cUSDC, registering the loan in `addCrossChainBorrow` and `addUserBorrowedAsset`.
4. Chain B confirms the loan via `_handleValidBorrowRequest` on Chain A, updating `addCrossChainBorrow`.
5. The user fully repays the 10 USDC local loan on Chain A, triggering `removeUserBorrowedAsset`, which removes cUSDC from `userBorrowedAssets`.
6. The user calls `borrow` on Chain A for 750 USDC (cUSDC):
   - `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` iterates over an empty `userBorrowedAssets`, ignoring the 740 USDC cross-chain debt.
   - `borrowed` = 750 USDC (new loan only), `collateral` = 1000 USDC.
   - The check `collateral >= borrowAmount` passes, allowing the 750 USDC loan.
7. The user absconds with both loans (740 USDC from Chain B + 750 USDC from Chain A = 1490 USDC), defaulting without repayment and abandoning the 1000 USDC collateral, resulting in a $490 protocol loss.

## Impact
The protocol suffers a catastrophic financial loss by granting loans totaling 1490 USDC against only 1000 USDC collateral, resulting in a net loss of $490 (49% of collateral value) when the user defaults without repaying any loans. For larger collaterals (e.g., $10,000), the loss scales to $4900 (49%), far exceeding 1%. Malicious users gain significant excess funds (1490 USDC, netting 490 USDC after collateral loss), while honest users face reduced pool liquidity and heightened insolvency risk. The core lending functionality is critically broken, as the protocol fails to enforce collateral limits, allowing users to exploit the system to abscond with funds far exceeding their collateral value. The attack can be repeated across multiple tokens, amplifying losses and destabilizing the protocol.

## PoC
The issue can be demonstrated as follows:
- Deploy Lend-V2 on two chains: Chain A (collateral and local borrowing) and Chain B (cross-chain borrowing). A user supplies 1000 USDC collateral on Chain A in a cUSDC pool with a 75% collateral factor.
- The user borrows 10 USDC locally on Chain A, registering cUSDC in `userBorrowedAssets`.
- The user borrows 740 USDC cross-chain on Chain B for cUSDC, registered in `addCrossChainBorrow`.
- The user repays the 10 USDC local loan on Chain A, triggering `removeUserBorrowedAsset`, removing cUSDC from `userBorrowedAssets`.
- The user calls `borrow` on Chain A for 750 USDC:
  - `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` reports `borrowed` = 750 USDC (new loan), ignoring 740 USDC cross-chain debt.
  - `collateral` = 1000 USDC, passing `collateral >= borrowAmount`.
- The user receives 750 USDC and retains 740 USDC from Chain B, totaling 1490 USDC. They default on both loans, abandoning the 1000 USDC collateral, resulting in a $490 protocol loss (1490 USDC – 1000 USDC).
- For a $10,000 collateral, the user absconds with 14900 USDC (7400 USDC + 7500 USDC), causing a $4900 loss (49%), far exceeding 1%, meeting high severity.

## Mitigation
Prevent removal of borrowed assets from `userBorrowedAssets` during local repayment if cross-chain borrows exist for the same token.
