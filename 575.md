# Blacklisted accounts cause state corruption and permanently trap user funds through silent transfer failures

### Summary

Unsafe ERC20 transfers in `CoreRouter.sol` cause permanent fund loss when blacklisted USDT/USDC addresses silently fail transfers while corrupting internal accounting state, leaving funds permanently trapped with no recovery mechanism.


### Root Cause

In `borrowForCrossChain()`, `redeem()` and `borrow()` functions use unsafe `IERC20.transfer()` instead of `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()`, allowing silent transfer failures that corrupt internal state while trapping user funds.**

- `redeem` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L124
- `borrow` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L170
- `borrowForCrossChain` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L204

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `supply()` to deposit USDT/USDC tokens into the protocol
2. User's address needs to be blacklisted by USDT/USDC after depositing funds


### External Pre-conditions

1. USDT/USDC issuer needs to blacklist the user's address, causing `transfer()` calls to return `false` instead of reverting
2. User needs to attempt withdrawal after being blacklisted

### Attack Path

1. **User calls `supply(amount, usdtToken)` and successfully deposits 1000 USDT**
2. **USDT issuer blacklists user's address
3. **User calls `redeem(lTokenAmount, lToken)` to withdraw their funds**
4. **CoreRouter updates user's `totalInvestment` to 0 in storage (state corruption)**
5. **CoreRouter calls `IERC20(usdt).transfer(user, 1000)` which returns `false` silently**
6. **Function completes successfully, emitting `RedeemSuccess` event despite failed transfer**
7. **1000 USDT remains trapped in CoreRouter with user's balance showing 0**

### Impact

The users suffer permanent loss of their entire deposited funds. The trapped funds cannot be recovered as the contract lacks emergency withdrawal functions and the user's internal balance is permanently zeroed.

### PoC

Place the following test into - `TestRedeeming.t.sol`

```solidity
 function test_that_redeem_uses_unsafe_transfer() public {
    vm.startPrank(deployer);
    
    // Supply tokens normally
    uint256 supplyAmount = 100e18;
    (address token, address lToken) = _supply(supplyAmount);
    
    // Get the lToken balance
    uint256 lTokenBalance = lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken);
    
    // Get initial contract balance (should be 0)
    uint256 initialContractBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(coreRouter));
    
    // Mock the underlying token's transfer function to return false (simulating blacklist)
    vm.mockCall(
        token,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, deployer, 100e18),
        abi.encode(false)
    );
    
    // The redeem should revert if using safeTransfer, but it doesn't because it uses unsafe transfer
    // This call will complete successfully even though the transfer fails
    uint256 result = coreRouter.redeem(lTokenBalance, payable(lToken));
    
    // The function returns 0 (success) even though transfer failed
    assertEq(result, 0, "Redeem should return 0 for success");
    
    // User's internal balance is now zero (state corrupted)
    assertEq(
        lendStorage.totalInvestment(deployer, lToken), 
        0, 
        "User's investment balance is zero - state corrupted"
    );
    
    // Contract received the tokens from lToken but failed to send to user
    uint256 finalContractBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(coreRouter));
    assertGt(finalContractBalance, initialContractBalance, "Contract should have received tokens");
    
    // This proves the vulnerability: unsafe transfer allows silent failures
    // Tokens are now trapped in CoreRouter with no recovery mechanism
    
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

Replace all unsafe `transfer()` calls with `safeTransfer()`:

```solidity
// Instead of:
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);

// Use:
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
```
