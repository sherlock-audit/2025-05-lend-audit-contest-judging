## Description
Throughout the borrow, borrowForCrossChain and redemption flows, the code uses `IERC20(token).transfer(...)` directly to send tokens back to users (for example, in CoreRouter.redeem(...) and CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain(...)). A direct call to transfer assumes that the token contract (1) returns true on success, (2) reverts on failure, and (3) does not implement non-standard behavior. However, some ERC-20 tokens either:
	1.	Do not return a boolean (they revert on failure without returning any value),
	2.	Return false instead of reverting, or
	3.	Implement other edge-case behaviors.

Invoking transfer(...) directly on such tokens can have one of two failure modes:
	•	Silent failure (returns false but does not revert), causing the router to believe the transfer succeeded while no tokens were actually sent to the user. This can lead to user funds being locked or lost in the contract.
	•	Uncaught revert (token reverts with no return), causing the entire transaction to revert unexpectedly, potentially disrupting user experience or leaving the contract state in an inconsistent intermediate.

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	A user supplies or redeems a token that does not return a boolean on transfer, for example an older “semi-ERC20” token.
	2.	During redeem, the code calls IERC20(token).transfer(user, amount). Because the token does not return true (or returns no value), the call may not be detected as a failure or may revert without returning a flag.
	3.	If the token returns false but does not revert, the router continues execution, emits RedeemSuccess, and reduces the user’s internal balance—yet no underlying tokens actually reach the user’s wallet. The user loses funds with no straightforward recovery.
	4.	Alternatively, if the token reverts without returning a boolean, the entire redeem transaction reverts, potentially trapping internal state (e.g., LEND distribution or investment accounting might not adjust as intended).

## Recommendations
Replace all direct uses of transfer(...) and transferFrom(...) with OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 wrappers:
```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

- IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
+ IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);

- IERC20(_destUnderlying).transfer(_borrower, _amount);
+ IERC20(_destUnderlying).safeTransfer(_borrower, _amount);

- IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
+ IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```
