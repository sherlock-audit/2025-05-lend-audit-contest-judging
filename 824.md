# If CoreRouter is liquidated, some user may suffer more loss than expected

### Summary

If CoreRouter is liquidated, some users may suffer more loss than expected.

### Root Cause

When a user redeem tokens from `CoreRouter`,  the underlying token amount to be received is calculated as `user amount * exchange rate`.

[CoreRouter.sol#L117-L118)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L117-L118):
```solidity
        // Calculate expected underlying tokens
        uint256 expectedUnderlying = (_amount * exchangeRateBefore) / 1e18;
```

The problem is that `CoreRouter` acts as both a supplier and borrower to `LToken`, therefore it's possible that `CoreRouter` is liquidated in `LToken` if its collateral is less than borrowed amount.

If `CoreRouter` is liquidated, it will have less collateral in `LToken` than before, however, such situation is not took into consideration when user s redeem, as a result, the users who redeem earlier can fully redeem, leaving the last users suffer the loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When user redeems, the received amount should be calculated based on `CoreRouter`'s collateral in `LToken`.
