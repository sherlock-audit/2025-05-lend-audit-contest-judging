# Unclaimable Protocol LEND Rewards After Liqudations

### Summary

When a user is liquidated, a portion of their collateral (seizeTokens) is allocated as protocol rewards. These protocol rewards earn LEND tokens but can not be claimed by anyone. Because, they are not added to any address's totalInvestment. distributeSupplierLend() is never called for the protocol's share. This creates "stuck" LEND rewards that cannot be claimed by anyone

### Root Cause

The controller calculates LEND rewards based on total market supply and borrow, which includes the protocol’s share of lTokens (acquired via liquidation).
However, in the CoreRouter, the protocol’s seized collateral (protocolReward) is not registered in totalInvestment, nor is it processed via distributeSupplierLend().

```solidity
lendStorage.updateProtocolReward(
    lTokenCollateral,
    lendStorage.protocolReward(lTokenCollateral) + currentReward
);
```

As a result:

- The protocol’s share increases the total supply, and thus contributes to overall LEND emission calculations,
- But no user or contract is eligible to claim the LEND tokens associated with that share.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Contoller distributes LEND rewards to CoreRouter based on total supply and borrow amounts
A portion of seized collateral (currentReward) is allocated to protocol rewards via updateProtocolReward()
distributeSupplierLend() is never called for the protocol's share



### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

LEND tokens accumulate at the CoreRouter  for the protocol without a way to claim them.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Register protocol reward as a totalInvestment entry
Update totalInvestment[protocol][lTokenCollateral] with the currentReward value:
`lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(protocolAddress, lTokenCollateral, existing + currentReward);
`
Then call:
`lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lTokenCollateral, protocolAddress);`
