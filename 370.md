# Market Entry Fails Due to `msg.sender` Context in `enterMarkets()` Call

### Summary

In `CrossChainRouter.sol#borrowCrossChain()`, the user is expected to enter a market by calling `enterMarkets(_lToken)` if they have not done so already. However, `enterMarkets()` calls the external contract function `Lendtroller.sol#enterMarkets()`, which is public and uses `msg.sender` to record the market entry.

Because the call originates from the `CrossChainRouter` contract (not the user directly), `msg.sender` in `Lendtroller` is the router’s address, not the user’s address. As a result, the user is never correctly marked as having entered the market in the `Lendtroller` state, causing the function `isMarketEntered(msg.sender, _lToken)` to always return false.

### Root Cause

`enterMarkets()` in the Lendtroller contract uses `msg.sender` to identify which user is entering the market. When `enterMarkets()` is called by the `CrossChainRouter` contract, `msg.sender` is the router’s address, not the original user who initiated the cross-chain borrow.
