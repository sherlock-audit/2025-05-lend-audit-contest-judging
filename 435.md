# Over-Borrowing Vulnerability in `CoreRouter` `borrow` Function

## Summary
The [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L145) function in `CoreRouter.sol` allows users to borrow arbitrarily large amounts of tokens (e.g., USDC) regardless of their collateral due to a flaw in the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function in `LendStorage.sol`. When a user has no prior borrows, `borrowAmount` is incorrectly set to 0, causing the collateral check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount)` in `CoreRouter.sol` to always pass. This enables users to over-borrow, potentially leading to significant protocol losses if they default.

## Root Cause
In `CoreRouter.sol`, the `borrow` function calls `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` to validate borrowing:
```solidity
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
```
In `LendStorage.sol`, `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` calculates the borrow balance, but the `borrow` function in `CoreRouter.sol` uses a separate calculation:
```solidity
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)
    : 0;
require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```
For users with no prior borrows, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is 0, setting `borrowAmount` to 0. The check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount)` passes for any collateral (e.g., $10 ETH), allowing unlimited borrowing without enforcing the collateral-to-debt ratio.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The protocol supports same-chain borrowing against collateral (e.g., ETH for USDC).
2. The `LendStorage` contract tracks borrows in `borrowBalance`, with `borrowIndex` initialized to 0 for new borrowers.
3. The `borrow` function relies on `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` and its own `borrowAmount` calculation.

## External Pre-conditions
1. A user deposits collateral (e.g., $10 worth of ETH) on a chain.
2. The user attempts to borrow an asset (e.g., USDC) for the first time, with no prior borrows.
3. The price oracle (`UniswapAnchoredViewInterface`) provides accurate prices for collateral and borrow assets.

## Attack Path
This issue can be exploited by users to borrow far beyond their collateral’s value. The steps below outline the vulnerability:

1. **User Deposits Collateral**:
   - User deposits $10 worth of ETH, recorded in `totalInvestment[user][lToken]` in `LendStorage`.

2. **User Initiates Borrow**:
   - User calls `borrow` to borrow a large amount of USDC (e.g., 1000 USDC).
   - `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` is called to validate the borrow.

3. **Flawed Borrow Calculation**:
   - Since the user has no prior borrows, `currentBorrow.borrowIndex == 0`, so `borrowAmount = 0`.
   - The collateral is valued (e.g., $10 ETH, adjusted by oracle price and collateral factor).
   - The check `require(collateral >= 0)` passes, ignoring the requested `_amount` (1000 USDC).

4. **Over-Borrowing**:
   - The borrow of 1000 USDC is executed, despite only $10 ETH collateral.

5. **Fund Loss**:
   - If the user defaults, the protocol seizes $10 ETH, incurring a loss (e.g., 990 USDC).

## Impact
- **Direct Fund Loss**: Users can borrow amounts exceeding their collateral, leading to protocol losses if they default, as collateral (e.g., $10 ETH) cannot cover the borrow (e.g., 1000 USDC). This meets Sherlock’s High severity threshold (>1% and >$10 loss, Section IV).
- **Protocol Insolvency Risk**: Widespread exploitation could deplete reserves, threatening solvency.
- **Core Functionality Broken**: The failure to enforce the collateral-to-debt ratio undermines the lending protocol’s core invariant, aligning with High severity (Section V).
- **Sherlock Criteria**: The issue requires only a first-time borrow, a standard use case, with no extensive external conditions (Section IV).

## Mitigation
Modify the `borrow` function in `CoreRouter.sol` to use the requested borrow amount (`_amount`) in the collateral check, ensuring it accounts for new borrows. Update the code as follows:
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 _amount, address _token) external {
    require(_amount != 0, "Zero borrow amount");

    address _lToken = lendStorage.underlyingTolToken(_token);

    LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();

    (uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
        lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);

    LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

    uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
        ? ((currentBorrow.amount * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) + _amount
        : _amount;

    require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");

   // rest of codes
}
```
This ensures `borrowAmount` includes the requested `_amount`, preventing over-borrowing and enforcing the collateral-to-debt ratio.
