# Cross-Chain Borrower Can Freely Receive LEND

### Summary
In the current implementation, when a user borrows across chains, the LEND rewards are distributed after the borrowAmount is applied. For the first borrow for the user, the lendBorrowerIndex is initialized to 0. As a result, the borrower can receive LEND rewards immediately upon borrowing, effectively allowing them to gain rewards from the contract start.

### Root Cause
The root cause is that the LEND distribution occurs after the user's borrowing state has been updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

```solidity
    function _handleBorrowCrossChainRequest(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) private {
        ...
        if (found) {
            ...
            lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(
                payload.sender, destUnderlying, index, userCrossChainCollaterals[index]
            );
        } else {
641:        lendStorage.addCrossChainCollateral(
                payload.sender,
                destUnderlying,
                LendStorage.Borrow({
                    ...
                })
            );
        }

        // Track borrowed asset
        lendStorage.addUserBorrowedAsset(payload.sender, payload.destlToken);

        // Distribute LEND rewards on destination chain
659:    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(payload.destlToken, payload.sender);
        ...
    }
```

### Impact
This flaw enables new cross-chain borrowers to receive LEND rewards while old users loss the LEND.
Posing a risk to governance roles and potentially resulting in losses for other users' LEND rewards.

### Mitigation
Consider executing the `addUserBorrowedAsset` function before the `addCrossChainCollateral` and `updateCrossChainCollateral` functions.
