# Incorrect Borrowing Capacity Calculation Leading to Denial of Service for Borrowing

### Summary

There is a logical flaw in the liquidity check within the `CoreRouter.sol` `borrow()` function. The function incorrectly calculates the user's total liabilities, leading to an inflated debt figure used for collateral validation. This makes the collateral requirements unduly stringent, potentially blocking eligible users from borrowing and impacting protocol usability.

In the `borrow()` function of `CoreRouter.sol`, when a user attempts to borrow assets, the protocol checks if the user has sufficient collateral. A critical piece of this checking logic is as follows:

```solidity
// 1. Simulate the account's overall liquidity status after the user borrows `_amount`
(uint256 borrowed, uint256 collateral) =
    lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(msg.sender, LToken(payable(_lToken)), 0, _amount);
// At this point, `borrowed` already includes the total value (typically in USD) of all the user's existing
// debts (with interest) PLUS the value of the current `_amount` being attempted to borrow.
// `collateral` is the user's total effective collateral value (typically in USD).

// 2. Get the user's same-chain borrow state for the current `_lToken` market (excluding the current `_amount`)
LendStorage.BorrowMarketState memory currentBorrow = lendStorage.getBorrowBalance(msg.sender, _lToken);

// 3. Attempt to "recalculate" a specific market's borrow amount based on the global `borrowed` value and market-specific indices
// @audit The calculation logic here is flawed
uint256 borrowAmount = currentBorrow.borrowIndex != 0
    ? ((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex) // <--- Problematic line
    : 0;

// 4. Use this recalculated `borrowAmount` for the final collateral check
require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral");
```


### Root Cause

In the [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/713372a1ccd8090ead836ca6b1acf92e97de4679/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L152-L161) function of `CoreRouter.sol`, when a user attempts to borrow assets, the protocol checks if the user has sufficient collateral. 

1.  **Return Values of `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...)`**:
    *   The `borrowed` value returned by this function (let's call it `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`) is already the **account's total debt (in a base unit like USD)**. This value is price-adjusted, includes interest accrued on all existing borrows across all markets, and crucially, **already incorporates the value of the `_amount` the user is currently attempting to borrow.**
    *   The `collateral` value returned (let's call it `totalCollateralUSD`) is the account's total effective collateral value, adjusted by collateral factors (in USD).
    *   **Therefore, the correct logic to determine if the user can safely borrow should be a direct comparison: `totalCollateralUSD >= totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`.**

2.  **Calculation Logic of the Problematic Line `uint256 borrowAmount = ...`**:
    *   This line attempts to use `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD` (a global USD value already including the new `_amount`) in a formula with the specific `_lToken` market's current borrow index (`LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()`) and the user's old borrow index in that market (`currentBorrow.borrowIndex`).
    *   **Semantic Error**:
        *   `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD` is a **total value**, mixing debts from various assets and different interest accruals.
        *   The formula `(X * newIndex) / oldIndex` is typically used to calculate the interest-accrued growth of a *single asset's principal* within a *specific market* from an old state (at `oldIndex`) to a new state (at `newIndex`).
        *   Using a **global, USD-denominated total debt (which already includes the new borrow amount)** incorrectly as if it were a specific market's "old principal" (still in USD) and then multiplying it by specific market rate indices is mathematically and logically incorrect.
    *   **Double Counting / Inflating the Borrow Amount**:
        *   `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD` **already includes** the value of the `_amount` to be borrowed.
        *   By further processing it with `(... / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)` (where `currentBorrow.borrowIndex` is generally less than `LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()`), this calculation effectively **inflates** the `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD` value, making the resulting `borrowAmount` significantly larger than `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`.
        *   This means the `borrowAmount` used in the final `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, ...)` check is improperly overestimated.

### Attack Path

1.  A user supplies sufficient collateral to the protocol.
2.  The user attempts to call `CoreRouter.borrow()` to borrow a certain `_amount`.
3.  Assume that at this point, `lendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...)` returns `collateral` and `borrowed` such that `collateral >= borrowed` (i.e., `totalCollateralUSD >= totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`), indicating the user *should* be able to borrow successfully.
4.  However, due to the incorrect calculation of `borrowAmount` in step 3 of the described code, `borrowAmount` becomes > `borrowed` (i.e., `borrowAmount` > `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`).
5.  The final check `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral")` fails, the transaction reverts, and the user is unable to borrow.

### Impact

Because `borrowAmount` is incorrectly overestimated, the `require(collateral >= borrowAmount, "Insufficient collateral")` check becomes **overly strict**.

*   **Denial of Service for Borrowing**: Even if a user actually has enough collateral to safely borrow `_amount` (i.e., `totalCollateralUSD >= totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`), they might be prevented from borrowing because the erroneously calculated `borrowAmount` (being much larger than `totalHypotheticalDebtUSD`) causes the `collateral >= borrowAmount` condition to fail.
*   **Reduced Protocol Utilization**: Eligible users being unable to borrow reduces the protocol's overall capital utilization and potential interest income.
*   **Poor User Experience**: Users who see sufficient collateral but are unable to borrow will be confused and frustrated.

This vulnerability does not directly lead to a loss of funds but severely impacts the usability of the core borrowing functionality of the protocol.
