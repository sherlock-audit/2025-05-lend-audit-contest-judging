# Users can bypass collateral requirements due to stale interest calculations in liquidity checks

### Summary

The lack of interest accrual before calculating account liquidity will cause incorrect collateral/borrow ratio calculations as `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` uses stale values, allowing users to perform actions that should be restricted.

### Root Cause

In `LendStorage.sol` contract, the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function calculates collateral and borrow values without first accruing interest on the relevant markets, leading to outdated calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Time must have passed since last interest accrual
2. Market must have outstanding borrows generating interest
3. User must have both borrowed and supplied assets

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has positions in multiple markets
2. Interest accumulates over time
3. User calls functions that check liquidity (borrow, redeem, etc)
4. `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` returns stale values because it uses `exchangeRateStored()` instead of current rates, and it doesn't accrue interest on borrowed positions
5. User can perform actions that should be restricted based on actual ratios

### Impact

Users can perform borrows or withdrawals that would make them undercollateralized if using current interest rates. This breaks core lending protocol invariants and risk parameters.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral to accrue interest on all relevant markets before calculations:
```diff
function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...) {
    // Accrue interest on all markets first
    for (uint i = 0; i < suppliedAssets.length; i++) {
+        LTokenInterface(suppliedAssets[i]).accrueInterest();
   //...
    }
    for (uint i = 0; i < borrowedAssets.length; i++) {
+        LTokenInterface(borrowedAssets[i]).accrueInterest();
   // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```
