# Incorrect collateral accounting in cross-chain borrow.

### Summary

In `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`, `totalBorrowed` on destination chain includes both cross chain and same chain borrows which is compared to  `payload.collateral`. This is incorrect as there must be some local collateral on destination chain for same chain borrows which is not taken into consideration. 

### Root Cause

In the function `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`, the system processes borrowing requests that originate from one blockchain (source chain) and are fulfilled on another (destination chain). As part of this logic, the function compares the `totalBorrowed` amount on the destination chain against the `payload.collateral` sent from the source chain to ensure that sufficient collateral exists to back the borrow.

However, there's a critical flaw in this comparison.

The `totalBorrowed` variable on the destination chain aggregates the total borrowings irrespective of their origin, meaning:

1. Cross-chain borrows (requested from another chain and settled on this chain)

2. Same-chain borrows (requested and settled on the same destination chain)

Both types of borrows contribute to the `totalBorrowed` amount.

On the other hand, `payload.collateral` only represents the collateral transferred via the cross-chain message during the current request. It does not account for any local collateral that may have been deposited directly on the destination chain to back same-chain borrows.

The function checks `if totalBorrowed <= payload.collateral`, assuming that all borrowed amounts on the destination chain are backed solely by the transferred collateral. This logic fails in scenarios where:
1. There are existing same-chain borrows that are already backed by local collateral on the destination chain.
2. New cross-chain borrows are being compared against `totalBorrowed`, which includes amounts that shouldn't be subject to this comparison.

This leads to underestimation of available collateral and may incorrectly reject legitimate borrow requests.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

This bug can lead to incorrect collateral validation, resulting in rejection of Valid Cross-Chain Borrow Requests.

Since `totalBorrowed` includes same-chain borrows but `payload.collateral` only includes cross-chain collateral, the system may:

1. Overestimate the borrower's debt relative to the available cross-chain collateral.

2. Reject legitimate borrow requests, even when the actual cross-chain borrowing is fully collateralized.

This negatively affects user experience by:

Preventing users from utilizing their collateral efficiently.

Leading to unnecessary borrow rejections or failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When validating a new cross-chain borrow, only `crossChainBorrowed` should be compared against `payload.collateral`.
