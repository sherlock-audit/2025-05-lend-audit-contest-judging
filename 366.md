# Protocol would accumulate bad debt if it cant liquidate bad positions

## Summary
Liquidation occurs to prevent borrower from accumulating bad debt from the protocol, the liquidator ensures that borrower position is undercollateralized before seizing collateral from the borrower, However when the amount to seize is greater than the collateral It should seize the remaining user collateral rather than reverting.
## Description
```solidity
    function liquidateSeizeUpdate(
        address sender,
        address borrower,
        address lTokenCollateral,
        address borrowedlToken,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) internal {
        (uint256 amountSeizeError, uint256 seizeTokens) = LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller)
            .liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(borrowedlToken, lTokenCollateral, repayAmount);
        require(amountSeizeError == 0, "Failed to calculate");

        // Revert if borrower collateral token balance < seizeTokens
@>        require(lendStorage.totalInvestment(borrower, lTokenCollateral) >= seizeTokens, "Insufficient collateral");

        uint256 currentReward = mul_(seizeTokens, Exp({mantissa: lendStorage.PROTOCOL_SEIZE_SHARE_MANTISSA()}));

        // Just for safety, Never gonna occur
        if (currentReward >= seizeTokens) {
            currentReward = 0;
        }
```
As we can see the liquidator wont be able to seize user collateral if the user balance cant cover the amount to seize this would prevent liquidator from seizing the collateral of a user with bad position. Rather than reverting it should seize the user remaining collateral to prevent them from accumulating bad debt
## Impact
Protocol would accumulate bad debt
## Recommended Mitigation
Seize the user remaining balance rather than reverting
