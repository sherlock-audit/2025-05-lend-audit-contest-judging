# The protocol will distribute rewards using outdated investment values to `sender` and `borrower`

### Summary

The protocol incorrectly calls `distributeSupplierLend()` before updating the `totalInvestment` values for the sender and borrower during collateral seizure, leading to misaligned reward distribution.

Calling the distribution logic before updating the usersâ€™ lToken balances means the rewards are calculated based on stale investment values, not reflecting the most recent token transfers resulting from the liquidation process. This violates expected reward accounting and can lead to unfair distribution.

### Impact

- sender may receive more protocol rewards than deserved, while the borrower may receive fewer or no rewards during liquidation. This skews the reward distribution mechanism and could be exploited over many liquidations to siphon unearned rewards.
