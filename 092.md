# Incorrect Application of Token-Specific borrowIndex on Aggregate Borrow Value

### Summary

Using a single-token borrowIndex to rescale a multi-token borrow total will cause an inflated borrow calculation for borrowers, as a user attempting to borrow will trigger a global liquidity check that incorrectly adjusts the total borrow with one tokenâ€™s borrowIndex, leading to unjustified rejections of valid borrow attempts.

### Root Cause

Applying `((borrowed * LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()) / currentBorrow.borrowIndex)` where _borrowed is a cross-token, interest-adjusted value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has supplied valid collateral across one or more markets.


### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The protocol calls getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral(...).
2. The returned borrowed sum is further (incorrectly) rescaled using LToken(_lToken).borrowIndex() / currentBorrow.borrowIndex.
3. This artificially inflates the borrow amount.
4. The protocol rejects valid borrows with require(collateral >= borrowAmount).

### Impact

Legitimate borrow attempts are blocked, degrading protocol usability and reducing capital efficiency.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the incorrect rescaling step; use the already interest-adjusted borrowed value directly when comparing against collateral.
