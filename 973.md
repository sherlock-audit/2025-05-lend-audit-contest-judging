# Users can receive lending token many times whenever corerouter balance is available. The claimlend function doesn't clear the balance amount after user receive the lending token

### Summary

The claimlend function doesn't clear the lending token balance after user receives the lending token. And so user can receive lending token multiple times whenever the corerouter lending balance is availble.
If the system has many users, it can be used many gas fees and also it can be reverted.

### Root Cause

[coreRouter 370](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L370C1-L391)

            if (borrowers) {
                for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
                    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(lToken, holders[j]);
                    unchecked {
                        ++j;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (suppliers) {
                for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
                    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lToken, holders[j]);
                    unchecked {
                        ++j;
                    }
                }
            }

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
            uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
            if (accrued > 0) {
                grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);

### Internal Pre-conditions

If attack calls the claimlend function, the attacker can receive the lending token many times.
Also, many users who has the lending balance amount, he can receive lending token continously

### External Pre-conditions

If the param holders in claimlend function has many users, it can be reverted due to the core router balance  

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls claimLend function 
2. if borrowers or suppliers has lend[accured], this contract will send Lending token to borrower and supplier.
3. after that, it doesn't clear the lend[accured] balance and so attacker can request this multipe times 

### Impact

lending token is not available every time and claimlend function can be reverted 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

we will clear the lending balance from user after user receive the lending token
