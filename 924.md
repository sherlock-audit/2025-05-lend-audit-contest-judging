# Draining LEND Tokens from the Pool

### Summary

When a user claims their LEND tokens, the `lendAccrued` variable doesnâ€™t update correctly, which lets them keep claiming rewards until the contract is emptied of LEND.

### Root Cause

As shown in the code below, when a user calls `claimLend` to collect their rewards, the function updates their rewards total and sends them LEND tokens but never adjusts `lendAccrued`, which is supposed to track their pending LEND balance.

```solidity
    function claimLend(address[] memory holders, LToken[] memory lTokens, bool borrowers, bool suppliers) external {
        LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).claimLend(address(this));

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < lTokens.length;) {
            address lToken = address(lTokens[i]);

            if (borrowers) {
                for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
                    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(lToken, holders[j]);
                    unchecked {
                        ++j;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (suppliers) {
                for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
                    lendStorage.distributeSupplierLend(lToken, holders[j]); <@
                    unchecked {
                        ++j;
                    }
                }
            }

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
            uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]);
            if (accrued > 0) {
                grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued); <@ audit
            }
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
    }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deposits collateral via the `CoreRouter` contract.
2. After some time, they can repeatedly claim rewards and drain the contract of its LEND tokens.


### Impact

The issue allows an attacker to steal LEND tokens from other suppliers and borrowers.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

I recommend updating `lendAccrued` whenever a user claims their LEND tokens.
