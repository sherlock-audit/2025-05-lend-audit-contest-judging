# Missing `isSameChain` Check in `_repayBorrowInternal()` Function

### Summary

In `repayBorrowInternal()`, the `isSameChain` flag is passed as an input parameter. However, the function lacks an if condition to check this flag and skip updating the data structures meant for same-chain borrowing during a cross-chain flow.

### Root Cause

The `repayBorrowInternal()` function is used to update data structures for both same-chain and cross-chain repayments. Although the `isSameChain` flag is passed to differentiate between the two, the function lacks an `if` check when updating same-chain-specific data structures such as `borrowBalance`. As a result, these data structures are incorrectly updated during cross-chain repayments.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Cross chain repayment.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User has cross chain loan on destination chain.
2. User has same chain loan on destination chain.
3. User tries to repay cross chain loan.
4. Same chain loan is also reduced or repaid.

### Impact

When a user has both a cross-chain loan and a same-chain loan on the destination chain, repaying the cross-chain loan unintentionally reduces or repays the same-chain loan as well. This can lead to inaccurate loan balances, potential fund mismanagement, and incorrect accounting in the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, wrap the relevant code that updates same-chain-specific data structures (such as `borrowBalance`) inside an `if (isSameChain)` condition. This ensures that the updates are executed only during same-chain repayments and skipped during cross-chain repayments.
