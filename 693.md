# Adversary can frontrun `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` to redeem or borrow again even though he has already received the borrowed tokens

### Summary

The LEND protocol's `borrowCrossChain()` function allows a user to receive borrowed funds on `Chain B` before their corresponding debt is recorded against their collateral on `Chain A`. This separation in the timing of fund disbursement and debt recording across transactions creates a window for adversaries. During this window, the adversary can frontrun the `_handleValidBorrowRequest()` transaction on `Chain A`. By exploiting `Chain A`'s temporarily outdated (and thus overly optimistic) view of their account liquidity using `CoreRouter.redeem()` to withdraw collateral or `CoreRouter.borrow()` to take out an additional loan, they can effectively leave their original cross chain loan undercollateralized, leading to a loss of funds for lenders on `Chain B`.

### Root Cause

In [`CrossChainRouter.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol) the vulnerability's cause is due to the design of the cross chain borrowing flow:

The borrowed tokens are sent to a user on the borrowing chain (`destChain`) in [`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L581-L673) and occurs before `_handleValidBorrowRequest()`, the transaction that updates the corresponding debt record against their collateral on the originating chain (`srcChain`).

1. When a user initiates a cross chain borrow, they receive funds on the `destChain` once the destChain's `CrossChainRouter` (via its [`_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L703-L731) handler and subsequently `CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain`) validates and executes the loan locally. At this precise moment, the actual debt exists, and the user has access to the borrowed funds on the `destChain`.

2. Following this, the destChain's `CrossChainRouter` dispatches a `ValidBorrowRequest` confirmation message to the srcChain via LayerZero.

3. The crucial update to the srcChain's `LendStorage` to record that the user's collateral on the `srcChain` is now encumbering this new debt from the destChain only happens when this LayerZero message is eventually processed on the `srcChain`, triggering the `CrossChainRouter._handleValidBorrowRequest` function.

4. In the interim period (after funds are disbursed on the destChain but before the confirmation message is processed and the debt recorded on the srcChain), the srcChain's `LendStorage` holds a stale view of the user's global liabilities; it does not yet account for the new cross chain debt.

5. Consequently, any calls to `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()` on the srcChain during this window will calculate the user's borrowing capacity or available redeemable collateral based on this outdated information, understating their true global debt. This temporary misrepresentation of their liquidity on the srcChain is what the adversary exploits by front running the confirmation message.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The adversary has successfully completed the borrowing phase of a `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` operation initiated from the srcChain, resulting in them receiving the borrowed funds on the destChain.

2. The destChain's `CrossChainRouter` has consequently dispatched a ValidBorrowRequest confirmation message back to the srcChain via LayerZero.

3. This `ValidBorrowRequest` LayerZero message (which, when processed, will trigger `_handleValidBorrowRequest` on the srcChain to record the debt) is present in the srcChain's mempool but has not yet been mined and executed.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The collateral chain (srcChain) must ideally be Ethereum or BSC etc to have access to the mempool, which allows the adversary to observe the incoming LayerZero transaction from the destChain.
2. The adversary must ensure their own transaction on the srcChain is mined before the LayerZero confirmation message's transaction. This is typically achievable by paying a higher gas price.

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain()` on the srcChain ideally on the Ethereum chain, designating `srcChain` assets as collateral to borrow an asset on the `destChain`. The srcChain's `CrossChainRouter` sends a `BorrowCrossChain` message to the `destChain`, which includes the user's current total collateral value as calculated on the srcChain.

2. The destChain's `CrossChainRouter` processes this request via its `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest` function. It verifies the provided collateral value from the srcChain is sufficient for the requested amount on the destChain, executes the borrow locally (transferring funds to the user on the destChain via `CoreRouter.borrowForCrossChain`), updates its own `LendStorage` (recording that this new debt on the `destChain` is backed by `srcChain` collateral), and sends a `ValidBorrowRequest` confirmation message back to the srcChain.

3. The adversary monitors the srcChain's mempool and identifies their own incoming `ValidBorrowRequest` LayerZero transaction sent by a LayerZero relayer. This transaction, when processed, will call `_handleValidBorrowRequest` and update their debt record on the srcChain.

4. Frontrunning Action on the srcChain: Before the ValidBorrowRequest message is processed on the srcChain, the adversary submits their own transaction on the srcChain with a higher gas fee. This transaction calls a function in the srcChain's `CoreRouter.sol`, for instance:

- `CoreRouter.redeem()`: To withdraw a portion of their collateral held on the srcChain (this could include the specific collateral implicitly backing the just-received loan on the destChain).

- `CoreRouter.borrow()`: To take out an additional same chain loan on the srcChain, using their available collateral. Both of these actions on the srcChain will be assessed by `LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral()`. Because the srcChain's `LendStorage` is not yet aware of the new debt incurred on the destChain, it will report a higher available liquidity or lower encumbrance than is accurate, approving these actions.

5. The adversary's frontrunning transaction is mined and executed on the srcChain. They successfully either reduce their collateral on the srcChain or increase their same-chain debt on the srcChain beyond what would be safe if the cross-chain debt were already accounted for.

6. Subsequently, the `ValidBorrowRequest` message from the `destChain` is processed on the srcChain. The` _handleValidBorrowRequest` function executes, updating the srcChain's `LendStorage` to finally record the cross chain debt from the destChain. However, the collateral intended to back this debt on the srcChain would now be critically insufficient due to the adversary's successful front running action.

### Impact

The adversary can exploit this vulnerability to ensure their cross chain loan from the destChain becomes significantly undercollateralized, or to secure additional same chain loans on the srcChain that are not adequately backed. By either withdrawing crucial collateral from the srcChain or taking on these additional undersecured same chain loans before their destChain debt is officially recorded on the srcChain, they create a situation where their total debt obligations massively exceed the actual value of the collateral securing them.

When the adversary inevitably defaults on these undercollateralized positions (as would be the rational action for an adversary), the protocol specifically the lenders who provided liquidity on the destChain and potentially those on the srcChain suffers a direct and irrecoverable loss of funds. The adversary effectively extracts value well beyond their collateral's worth, leaving the protocol to absorb the financial shortfall. This constitutes a critical failure of the protocol's collateralization mechanism, akin to theft of lender capital.

### Mitigation

Implement an "optimistic earmarking" or "pending state" mechanism on the collateral chain (srcChain) to account for outgoing cross-chain borrow requests immediately upon their initiation.

1. Record Pending Debt Commitment: When CrossChainRouter.borrowCrossChain() is called on the srcChain to initiate a cross-chain borrow:

- Immediately create a record in the srcChain's LendStorage representing a "pending outgoing cross-chain debt." This record should detail the user and an estimated USD impact of the requested remote borrow, or identify the local collateral being committed.

2. Update Liquidity Calculation: Modify LendStorage.getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral() on the srcChain to query and factor in these active "pending outgoing debts." This will reduce the user's calculated available liquidity on the srcChain as soon as the cross-chain borrow is initiated, effectively closing the front-running window.

3. Resolve Pending State upon Confirmation:
- When CrossChainRouter._handleValidBorrowRequest() is later executed on the srcChain (after a successful borrow confirmation from the destChain), the corresponding "pending outgoing debt" record should be cleared or marked as resolved. The actual, confirmed cross-chain debt is then recorded as currently implemented.

4. Handle Failures: Implement a mechanism for the destChain to send a failure notification message back to the srcChain if the cross-chain borrow cannot be processed. The srcChain would then need a new handler in its CrossChainRouter to receive this message and clear the corresponding "pending outgoing debt" record, restoring the user's correctly calculated liquidity on the srcChain.

This "earmarking" approach ensures that the srcChain's view of a user's liquidity reflects initiated cross-chain borrow commitments immediately, preventing exploitation of the state during the message relay period.
