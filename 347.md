# LEND rewards are calculated after balance updates, leading to inaccurate and unfair reward distribution.

### Summary

In the `CrossChainRouter `contract, the function `distributeBorrowerLend `is called after borrow balances are updated in three key functions: `_updateRepaymentState`, `_handleDestRepayMessage`, and `_handleBorrowCrossChainRequest`. This causes LEND rewards to be calculated based on the new (lower or higher) borrow balance, rather than the previous balance, resulting in users receiving fewer (or more) rewards than they are entitled to.

### Root Cause

When a user repays a borrow, is liquidated, or completes a cross-chain borrow, the protocol first updates the borrow balance or adds a new borrow record, and only then calls `lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend`. Since LEND rewards are distributed based on the current borrow balance, this means the user receives rewards for new balances, rather than balances for the full period before current action. The correct approach is to call `distributeBorrowerLend `before any balance updates, so rewards are calculated on the user's actual borrow exposure up to that point.

With the current flow, the following in  `distributeBorrowerLend` will be true for new borrows: 

```solidity
     if (borrowerIndex == 0 && borrowIndex >= LEND_INITIAL_INDEX) {
            // Covers the case where users borrowed tokens before the market's borrow state index was set.
            // Rewards the user with LEND accrued from the start of when borrower rewards were first
            // set for the market.
            borrowerIndex = LEND_INITIAL_INDEX;
        }
```

This will lead to calculation of LEND accrual from the starting borrow index and it will be a very high amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

LEND is being distributed for the borrow balances.

### External Pre-conditions

The user repays a borrow, is liquidated, or completes a cross-chain borrow.

### Attack Path

1. User borrows and accrues LEND rewards over time.
2. User repays, is liquidated, or completes a cross-chain borrow.
3. The protocol updates the borrow balance, then calls `distributeBorrowerLend`.
4. Rewards are calculated on the new, lower (or higher) balance, shortchanging (or over-rewarding) the user.

### Impact

Users receive less (or more) LEND rewards than they should, as rewards are calculated on the updated balance rather than the pre-update balance.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Move the call to `distributeBorrowerLend `so it occurs before any borrow balance updates or removals during repayment, liquidation, and cross-chain borrow flows.
