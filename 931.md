# when  _handleLiquidationSuccess function executing was reverted, it doesn't revert the state change on source chain

### Summary

[CrosschainRouter.sol 458]
 function _handleLiquidationSuccess(LZPayload memory payload) private {
        // Find the borrow position on Chain B to get the correct srcEid
        address underlying = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(payload.destlToken);

        // Find the specific collateral record
        (bool found, uint256 index) = lendStorage.findCrossChainCollateral(
            payload.sender,
            underlying,
            currentEid, // srcEid is current chain
            0, // We don't know destEid yet, but we can match on other fields
            payload.destlToken,
            payload.srcToken
        );

        require(found, "Borrow position not found");
If this function executing was reverted. There was no way to revert the state change on source chain achieved by _handleLiquidationExecute function.
Following function was called on source chain  but it updates the state before making repayment.


function _handleLiquidationExecute(LZPayload memory payload, uint32 srcEid) {
 // Update total investment for borrower
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            payload.sender,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) - payload.amount
        );

        // Update total investment for liquidator
        lendStorage.updateTotalInvestment(
            payload.liquidator,
            payload.destlToken,
            lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.liquidator, payload.destlToken) + liquidatorShare
        );

        // Clear user supplied asset if total investment is 0
        if (lendStorage.totalInvestment(payload.sender, payload.destlToken) == 0) {
            lendStorage.removeUserSuppliedAsset(payload.sender, payload.destlToken);
        }



### Root Cause

[crossChainRouter.sol  458]
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CrossChainRouter.sol#L457)

If the _handleLiquidationSuccess executing is reverted, there was no way to revert the state change on _handleLiquidationExecute executing 

### Internal Pre-conditions

If _handleLiquidationSuccess is  reverted on require statement or transfer

### External Pre-conditions

If _handleLiquidationSuccess is  reverted on require statement or transfer

### Attack Path

Attacker calls liquidateCrossChain funtion without repayment token as liquidator.
If the repayment was reverted on IERC safetransfer due to balance , it will be reverted but the state change will be retained


### Impact

Attacker can increase total investment without repayment and can steal tokens. It is dangerous for pool
