# Users can steal LEND tokens using `CoreRouter::claimLend()`

### Summary

When users call `claimLend()` to claim their accrued lend tokens, `lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j])` is called to evaluate the amount of LEND due the users 

### Root Cause

The problem is that the `lendAccrued` is never zeroed out after a user claims their LEND hence a user can exploit this to steal LEND exceeding their accrued amount from the protocol by continuously calling [`cliamLend()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L401) thus earning more than the amount of LEND rightly accrued by them.

```sol

File: Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol
371:     function claimLend(address[] memory holders, LToken[] memory lTokens, bool borrowers, bool suppliers) external {
372:         LendtrollerInterfaceV2(lendtroller).claimLend(address(this));

////SNIP
399: 
400:         for (uint256 j = 0; j < holders.length;) {
401:     @>      uint256 accrued = lendStorage.lendAccrued(holders[j]); // @audit HIGH: lendaccrued is additive hence it can be claimed many times causing user to steal fomr the protocol
402:             if (accrued > 0) {
403:                 grantLendInternal(holders[j], accrued);
404:             }
405:             unchecked {
406:                 ++j;
407:             }
408:         }
409:     }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

This doe not need an attack path as bug has been explained in the Root Cause section

### Impact

Users can steal LEND token due to missing update of the amount of LEND accrued by users after claiming their LEND

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider implementing a function that resets the `lendAccrued` variable in the `lendStorage` contract and call this function at the end of the `claimLend()` execution
