# CoreRouter does not support fee-on-transfer tokens like USDT

### Summary

CoreRouter does not support fee-on-transfer tokens, leading to accounting inconsistencies where users receive more lTokens than the actual underlying tokens transferred to the protocol.

### Root Cause

The `supply()` function in CoreRouter.sol assumes the full `_amount` is transferred when calling `safeTransferFrom()`, but fee-on-transfer tokens (like USDT when fees are enabled) deduct fees during transfer. The protocol mints lTokens based [on the original `_amount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LayerZero/CoreRouter.sol#L69) rather than the actual received amount:

```solidity
// Transfer tokens from the user to the contract
IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

_approveToken(_token, _lToken, _amount);

// Get exchange rate before mint
uint256 exchangeRateBefore = LTokenInterface(_lToken).exchangeRateStored();

// Mint lTokens
require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).mint(_amount) == 0, "Mint failed");
```

In contrast, Compound's implementation correctly handles this by using the actual transferred amount returned from [`doTransferIn()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-lend-audit-contest/blob/main/Lend-V2/src/LErc20.sol#L200) for minting calculations:

```solidity
uint256 actualMintAmount = doTransferIn(minter, mintAmount);
uint256 mintTokens = div_(actualMintAmount, exchangeRate);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A fee-on-transfer token (like USDT) is supported by the protocol:
> Whitelisted only (e.g BTC, ETH, USDC, DAI, **USDT**). ERC20 standard.

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDT or other fee-on-transfer tokens have fees activated on the deployment chains

### Attack Path

1. User calls `supply()` with 1000 USDT (assuming 1% transfer fee)
2. Protocol receives only 990 USDT due to the transfer fee
3. Protocol mints lTokens based on the full 1000 USDT amount
4. User's accounting shows 1000 USDT worth of lTokens while protocol only holds 990 USDT
5. When `distributeSupplierLend()` is called, LEND rewards are calculated based on the inflated 1000 USDT amount

### Impact

1. Protocol records more tokens in user balances than actually held, leading to potential insolvency
2. Users receive excessive LEND token rewards through `distributeSupplierLend()` since rewards are calculated based on inflated `totalInvestment` amounts
3. Over time, the accumulated differences between recorded and actual balances could lead to withdrawal failures

### PoC

No response

### Mitigation

Implement balance checking before and after transfers to determine the actual amount received, or use `doTransferIn` function and its return value.
