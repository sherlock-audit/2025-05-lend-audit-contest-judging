# Reward Distribution Timing Issue in CoreRouter.sol

### Summary

**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `CoreRouter.sol::repayBorrowInternal` 
**Description**: In the `repayBorrowInternal` function, `distributeBorrowerLend()` is invoked before the repayment is processed. This causes rewards to be calculated and distributed based on the pre-repayment borrow balance (e.g., 300 DAI) rather than the post-repayment balance (e.g., 200 DAI). As a result, borrowers may receive rewards for a larger borrow amount than they hold after repayment, potentially leading to over-claiming of rewards.

### Root Cause

The `repayBorrowInternal` function follows this sequence:
1. **Accrue Interest**: `LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();` updates the borrow balance with accrued interest.
2. **Fetch Borrow Balance**: `lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken)` retrieves the current borrow balance (e.g., 300 DAI).
3. **Determine Repayment Amount**: `repayAmountFinal` is set to either the full borrow balance or the specified `_amount` (e.g., 100 DAI).
4. **Transfer Tokens**: Tokens are transferred from the liquidator or borrower to the contract.
5. **Distribute Rewards**: `lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower);` calculates and distributes rewards based on the pre-repayment borrow balance.
6. **Execute Repayment**: `LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal)` reduces the borrow balance (e.g., to 200 DAI).
7. **Update Storage**: The borrow balance in `lendStorage` is updated to reflect the repayment.

Since `distributeBorrowerLend()` is called before the repayment, it uses the pre-repayment balance (300 DAI) for reward calculation. If the reward mechanism does not properly account for the time-weighted balance or is intended to reflect the post-repayment state, this leads to inflated reward payouts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

#### Example
- **Initial State**: Alice borrows 300 DAI.
- **Action**: Alice repays 100 DAI in one transaction.
- **Execution**:
  - `distributeBorrowerLend()` calculates rewards using 300 DAI.
  - Repayment reduces the balance to 200 DAI.
- **Outcome**: Alice receives rewards for 300 DAI for the period up to repayment, which may be correct if rewards are time-weighted. However, if the protocol intends rewards to reflect the post-repayment balance or miscalculates within `distributeBorrowerLend()`, she over-claims.

#### Exploit Scenario
- **Step 1**: Alice borrows 10,000 DAI, accruing rewards over time.
- **Step 2**: In one transaction, she repays 9,900 DAI.
- **Execution**:
  - Rewards are distributed based on 10,000 DAI.
  - Balance reduces to 100 DAI.
- **Result**: Alice claims rewards for 10,000 DAI up to the repayment point, potentially exceeding the intended amount if the reward calculation is flawed.

### Impact


- **Borrower**: Gains excess rewards, receiving payouts disproportionate to their post-repayment balance.
- **Protocol**: Suffers financial losses due to over-distribution of rewards, undermining economic stability.

### PoC


Below is a simplified Solidity PoC demonstrating the issue. It assumes `distributeBorrowerLend()` calculates rewards based on the current borrow balance at the time of the call, leading to rewards being distributed on the pre-repayment balance.


```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract LTokenMock {
    uint256 public borrowIndex;
    mapping(address => uint256) public borrowBalance;

    constructor() {
        borrowIndex = 1e18;
    }

    function accrueInterest() external {
        borrowIndex = borrowIndex * 11 / 10; // Simulate interest accrual
    }

    function repayBorrow(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256) {
        borrowBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        return 0;
    }
}

contract LendStorageMock {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public borrowBalances;
    uint256 public rewardRate = 1e18; // 1 reward per borrow unit per call
    mapping(address => uint256) public rewards;

    function borrowWithInterestSame(address borrower, address lToken) external view returns (uint256) {
        return borrowBalances[borrower][lToken];
    }

    function distributeBorrowerLend(address lToken, address borrower) external {
        uint256 borrowBalance = borrowBalances[borrower][lToken];
        rewards[borrower] += borrowBalance * rewardRate / 1e18;
    }

    function updateBorrowBalance(address borrower, address lToken, uint256 newBalance, uint256) external {
        borrowBalances[borrower][lToken] = newBalance;
    }

    function removeBorrowBalance(address borrower, address lToken) external {
        borrowBalances[borrower][lToken] = 0;
    }

    function removeUserBorrowedAsset(address, address) external {}
}

contract CoreRouterPoC {
    LendStorageMock public lendStorage;
    LTokenMock public lToken;
    address public token;

    constructor(address _lendStorage, address _lToken, address _token) {
        lendStorage = LendStorageMock(_lendStorage);
        lToken = LTokenMock(_lToken);
        token = _token;
    }

    function repayBorrow(uint256 _amount, address _lToken) public {
        repayBorrowInternal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _lToken, true);
    }

    function repayBorrowInternal(
        address borrower,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _lToken,
        bool _isSameChain
    ) internal {
        lToken.accrueInterest();
        uint256 borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
        uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

        // Simulate token transfer (commented out for simplicity)
        // IERC20(token).transferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);

        lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower); // Rewards based on pre-repayment balance

        require(lToken.repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");

        if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
            lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        } else {
            lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, 0);
        }
    }
}

contract PoC_Test {
    LendStorageMock public lendStorage;
    LTokenMock public lToken;
    address public token;
    CoreRouterPoC public router;
    address public borrower = address(0x1);

    constructor() {
        lendStorage = new LendStorageMock();
        lToken = new LTokenMock();
        token = address(0x2);
        router = new CoreRouterPoC(address(lendStorage), address(lToken), token);

        // Set initial borrow balance
        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(borrower, address(lToken), 300e18, 0);
    }

    function test_RewardDistributionTiming() external {
        uint256 initialRewards = lendStorage.rewards(borrower);
        router.repayBorrow(100e18, address(lToken));
        uint256 finalRewards = lendStorage.rewards(borrower);
        uint256 distributedRewards = finalRewards - initialRewards;

        // Rewards are based on 300 DAI, not 200 DAI
        assert(distributedRewards == 300e18 * lendStorage.rewardRate() / 1e18);
    }
}
```

#### PoC Explanation
- **Setup**: The borrower starts with a 300 DAI borrow balance.
- **Repayment**: The borrower repays 100 DAI.
- **Observation**: `distributeBorrowerLend()` distributes rewards based on 300 DAI before the repayment reduces the balance to 200 DAI.
- **Result**: The test confirms rewards are calculated using the pre-repayment balance (300 DAI), which may lead to over-distribution if not intended.


### Mitigation


To mitigate this issue:
1. **Adjust Timing**: Move `distributeBorrowerLend()` after the repayment and balance update to ensure rewards reflect the post-repayment balance.
2. **Verify Reward Logic**: Ensure `distributeBorrowerLend()` calculates rewards based on the time-weighted borrow balance up to the repayment point, not just the instantaneous balance.

#### Proposed Fix
```solidity
function repayBorrowInternal(
    address borrower,
    address liquidator,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _lToken,
    bool _isSameChain
) internal {
    address _token = lendStorage.lTokenToUnderlying(_lToken);
    LTokenInterface(_lToken).accrueInterest();
    uint256 borrowedAmount = lendStorage.borrowWithInterestSame(borrower, _lToken);
    require(borrowedAmount > 0, "Borrowed amount is 0");
    uint256 repayAmountFinal = _amount == type(uint256).max ? borrowedAmount : _amount;

    IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(liquidator, address(this), repayAmountFinal);
    _approveToken(_token, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);

    require(LErc20Interface(_lToken).repayBorrow(repayAmountFinal) == 0, "Repay failed");

    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeBorrowBalance(borrower, _lToken);
        lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
    } else {
        lendStorage.updateBorrowBalance(
            borrower, _lToken, borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal, LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex()
        );
    }

    lendStorage.distributeBorrowerLend(_lToken, borrower); // Moved after repayment

    emit RepaySuccess(borrower, _lToken, repayAmountFinal);
}
```
