# The `userBorrowedAssets` array is incorrectly updated during borrow repayments.

### Summary

The `userBorrowedAssets` array is incorrectly updated during borrow repayments.The LToken address is removed from `userBorrowedAssets` when all cross-chain borrows for that market are repaid, without checking if same-chain borrows still exist. Conversely, when same-chain borrows are fully repaid, the market is removed from `userBorrowedAssets` even if cross-chain borrows for that market are still active.

As a result, some active borrows are no longer considered during liquidation calculations in the `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityCollateral` function, since a borrow from a specific market is only taken into account if that market is present in the `userBorrowedAssets` array. This leads to incorrect liquidity calculations, allowing a user's collateral to be unlocked even when outstanding borrows still exist. Ultimately, this can result in bad debt for the protocol.


```solidity
function _updateRepaymentState(
    address borrower,
    address _token,
    address _lToken,
    LendStorage.Borrow memory borrowPosition,
    uint256 repayAmountFinal,
    uint256 borrowedAmount,
    uint256 index,
    uint32 _srcEid
) private {
    uint256 currentBorrowIndex = LTokenInterface(_lToken).borrowIndex();
    LendStorage.Borrow[] memory userCrossChainCollaterals = lendStorage.getCrossChainCollaterals(borrower, _token);

    if (repayAmountFinal == borrowedAmount) {
        lendStorage.removeCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index);

        if (userCrossChainCollaterals.length == 1) {
            // @audit-issue: This removes the asset from `userBorrowedAssets` without checking for existing same-chain borrows
            lendStorage.removeUserBorrowedAsset(borrower, _lToken);
        }
    } else {
        userCrossChainCollaterals[index].principle = borrowedAmount - repayAmountFinal;
        userCrossChainCollaterals[index].borrowIndex = currentBorrowIndex;
        lendStorage.updateCrossChainCollateral(borrower, _token, index, userCrossChainCollaterals[index]);
    }
    ...
}

### Root Cause

The `removeUserBorrowedAsset()` function is called after all cross-chain borrows for a token are repaid, without checking if same-chain borrows for that token still exist (and vice versa). 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice supplies 500 USDC as collateral on Ethereum.
2. Alice also supplies 500 USDC as collateral on Arbitrum.
3. Alice takes a same-chain borrow of 450 DAI on Arbitrum. This causes `cDAI` (lToken) to be added to `userBorrowedAssets`.
4. Alice then takes a cross-chain borrow of 450 DAI on Arbitrum (originating from Ethereum).
5. Later, Alice fully repays the cross-chain borrow. Since it was her only cross-chain borrow for DAI, the logic removes `cDAI` from `userBorrowedAssets`.
6. However, Alice still has the same-chain borrow from step 3. Due to the removal of cDAI  from `userBorrowedAssets`, it is now excluded from liquidity calculations.
7. As a result, during liquidity checks, Alice appears to have no outstanding debt, and the protocol unlocks all of her 1000 USDC collateral.
8. Alice then withdraws all her collateral, even though she still owes 450 DAI.
9. The protocol is left with 450 DAI of bad debt.

### Impact

Malicious users can exploit this flaw to unlock and withdraw their collateral despite having outstanding borrows. This leads to incorrect liquidity calculations and results in bad debt for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before removing a market (lToken) from `userBorrowedAssets`, the system should check that all borrow positions for that market, both same-chain and cross-chain, are fully repaid. Only then should the market be removed from the tracking array.
