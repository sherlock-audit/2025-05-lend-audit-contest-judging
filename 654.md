# ETH Shortage Allows Liquidation Without Repaying

### Summary

`CrossChainRouter.sol#liquidateCrossChain()` assumes the protocol will always have enough ETH to complete all required LayerZero messages. However, if the contract's ETH balance is insufficient midway through a multi-message operation, critical state transitions can remain unfinished, leading to exploitable system state.

### Root Cause

The protocol assumes all cross-chain operations in `liquidateCrossChain()` will complete successfully, but it does not validate or reserve sufficient ETH upfront to cover the entire sequence of LayerZero messages required for multi-chain operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract has just enough ETH to cover the first messages, but not all required for the operation.

2. No check or mechanism ensures atomicity or ETH sufficiency across the entire cross-chain flow.

3. No rollback or partial failure protection is in place.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `liquidateCrossChain()` on Chain B, initiating a cross-chain liquidation.

2. The first LayerZero message succeeds:

   On Chain A, the liquidator is credited with the seized collateral from the borrower.

3. The second message succeeds:

   On Chain B, the protocol attempts to collect the repayment from the liquidator and adjust debt records.

   The third message, meant to finalize the debt clearing back on Chain A, fails due to insufficient ETH in the protocol's contract.

**As a result:**

   The liquidator keeps the seized collateral, despite not repaying the debt.

   The borrower's debt remains open, but his total investment is reduced.

### Impact

Malicious user can liquidate without repaying.
